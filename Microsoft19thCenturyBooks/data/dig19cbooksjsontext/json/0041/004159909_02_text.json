CHAP. I. THE NORTHERN SLOPF. The northern slope seems to be the most appropriate name which can be given to that natural division of Hampshire which lies to the north of the great chalk ridge. This is a district of small extent, but it is well defined by natural boundaries, especially on the south and the north. The southern boundary begins near Woodhay oak-copse, where a projecting angle of Berkshire extends to the summit of the downs; and it may be traced thence eastward and a little to the south, in a series of curves, all having their princi pal convexity southward, to Winklebury hill near Basing- stoke, which is about seventeen or eighteen miles along the summitvlevel, and about fifteen on the straight line. The eastern boundary, which is not so well defined by nature, may be taken from Winklebury to Silchester, which is about six miles and a half on the straight line, and not above seven on the country road from Rooksdown, near VOL. II. B"], [14, "2 THE NORTHERN SLOPE. Winklebury, to the boundary of the county at the village of Amphitheatre, near Silchester, which village is however in Berks. This Berkshire village must not be confounded with the remains of the Roman amphitheatre at Silchester, which is within Hampshire, though very near the boundary. The northern boundary is, first about six miles westward from Silchester, principally across Silchester and Tadley commons to the river Emborne, and then westward along the bank of that river about nine miles, or to within a mile or two of its source. The western boundary is irregular and of very trifling length ; for, notwithstanding its bend ings, the whole measure of it, from the Emborne to the summit of the hills, is not above three miles. This part of Hampshire differs considerably from the portion south of the chalk ridge in all its physical characters, \u2014 in the nature of the soil, the form of the surface, the quantity of running water, the nature of the vegetation, and the climate as affected both by the situation and the surface ofthe district. Though in Hants, this tract of country naturally belongs to the vale of Berkshire, which is a continuation of the great valley of the Thames; this valley, estimating it by its geological formation, extends from Marlborough in Wilt shire, to within a few miles of Margate on the south bank of the river and its estuary. The surface-stratum of the whole of this extensive portion of England belongs to the tertiary formation of the geologists, which consists of clay of dif ferent colours and consistencies, variously mixed with more or less of sand or gravel, and with the heights not unfre quently capped with the latter substance. There is an ex ception, however, in those beds of hungry sand with little or no clay in them, which are situated between Kingston and Basingstoke ; but, though these approach the extreme north-east of Hampshire, none of them are far within the county, at least in such quantity as to merit particular no tice. Flatness, general fertility with rather a rank vegeta tion, and a foggy atmosphere, drizzling, rather than raining"], [15, "3 THE NORTHERN SLOPE. in torrents in the fall of the year, and dry and often cold in the early season, are the prevailing characters of the climate on this tertiary formation ; and of course the northern slope of Hampshire partakes of them, though to a much smaller extent than counties farther down the Thames. This ter tiary formation lies over the chalk, though often, with a bed of loose sand between them ; and, as the bounding chalk hills have always a bolder escarpment toward the tertiary valleys than towards the smaller vales and undula tions of the chalk itself, a quantity of the rain, which falls in torrents upon the hills, perculates in between the chalk and the tertiary formation, and, as these are both, to a great extent, water-proof, swells the loose sand a little, and fills it with water of the finest quality, from the nature and length of the filter through which it passes. The fact is, that this water undergoes exactly the same kind of purifi cation as that of the rivers in chalk countries ; and thus the people near London may be said to have the Itchen under the Thames, sometimes at the depth of two hundred feet or more. The northern slope of Hants, is only one side of a se condary branch of the great valley, and it is the portion of it which is the most distant from the sea ; consequently it has all the characters in a slighter degree, but still it has traces of them. The cold drying winds, which are but too often so injurious to the early crops on the eastern parts of the formation, do not come here in the full effects of their destruction ; they are arrested by the windings of the valley, and by woods and other surface-obstructions, but still they are a little felt. On the other hand, this part of Hampshire is in a great measure cut off from the action of the Channel atmosphere by the dry chalk hills and downs immediately to the south ; these act as a furnace, in turning the air which comes to them upward, when the weather is hot and dry ; and as a pair of bellows, in blowing it down upon the valleys, when the weather is cold. b2"], [16, "4 THE NORTHERN SLOPE. Wherever the tertiary formation crops out upon the chalk, there is a certain intermixture of the particles of the two, as well as of the more substantial parts of the chalk formation. The flints, which are often of considerable size and gene rally sponge-shaped, in the solid beds of chalk, are always more or less rounded, and not unfrequently into perfect spheres, when they occur in the clay or clayey gravel of the tertiary formation. So also, for a greater or less distance inward from the border of the chalk, a considerable portion of disintegrated chalk is mixed with the clay ; thus forming a calcareous clay-loam, which is one of the best soils for the more substantial kinds both of agriculture and of planting. These general properties of the soil will enable the reader to conclude, without any long enumeration of details, that this is one of the richest farming districts, as well as the best-wooded one, in the whole county,- \u2014 indeed it en joys advantages over the same soil farther down the valley, in consequence of its inland situation. But, though a soil of this kind is very rich for the stronger kinds of vegetation, it is not so well adapted for the very delicate as that which is found on the other side of the chalk ridges where they are bordered, generally speaking, by the green sand. The admixture there is of a different nature, being less reten tive of humidity, and such soils are best adapted for the culture of the hop. A district of this character cannot be a land of springs, any more than the chalk or the loose sand ; but it is everywhere a land of streams during the winter months ; and, in situations such as that which we are en deavouring to describe, the streams are perennial, because though, as we have said, a portion of the water that falls on the heights insinuates itself under the clay, there is another portion which escapes through the most porous parts of the soil just upon the margin of the chalk. Accordingly we find that this part of Hampshire abounds in brooks, as compared with any other part of the county, and especially as compared with the chalky districts. The chalk itself turns"], [17, "5 THE NORTHERN SLOPE. round the western termination of the tertiary bed \u2014 to the westward of Hampshire indeed, but not very far to the west ward ; and thus the northern slope of Hampshire supplies all the feeders of the Emborne. These are, it is true, mere brooks, for all of them flow from the bottom of the chalk hills directly to the river, only with a slight inclination eastwaru, which is, of course, the general slope of the whole valley ; though the slope of this particular part is more to the north than to the east. These feeders of the Emborne are small nameless brooks, the course of the largest of them not being more than four or five miles ; but they occur through out the whole district at distances of sometimes one mile, and rarely, if ever, more than two miles, from each other. There is an elevation in Berkshire, to the north of the Emborne, consisting, to a considerable extent, of heaths ; and just where the river ceases to form the boundary of Berkshire it escapes more northward, through a pass in this height, and joins the Kennet, in the meadows of that river, after a course of a few miles farther. This height \u2014 which is however not of great elevation \u2014 rises again in the commons to the west of Silchester ; and, from near Sil chester, a summit-level extends south-west through Pamber forest to the chalk hills, about four miles north-west of Winklebury, and between the parish churches of Monk's Sherborne on the east, and Ewhurst to the west. The turning of this summit-level makes a sub-division of the district into the part whose waters flow to the Loddon, and that whence they flow to the Emborne ; and, as is usual at summit-levels on this formation, the country is diversified by swells and hollows, \u2014 for one can hardly call them hills and dales. The largest feeder of the Emborne rises near Ewhurst, and is there connected into a considerable extent of ornamental water. This one has a good many little branches ; and, different from the others, the course of it is in a north-westerly direction. Of the branches of the Loddon which flow eastward, we shall take some notice when we come to treat of the valley of that river, or rather of the"], [18, "6 THE NORTHERN SLOPE. country across which it flows, for it is not a regular valley. Such are the natural features of this part of Hants ; and the present aspect of the country, in its cultivated fields, its woods, and its other particulars, is in accordance. Formerly it must have, as was the case with most of the tertiary formations, been a forest, abounding with deer and other wild animals ; and this is, in all likelihood, the reason why, in early times, both the bishops of Winchester and the kings of England had residences in it. It afforded better game, and more hardy sport in the finding of it, than the dry soils farther to the south ; and this was, in all proba bility, the reason why the mighty men of old resorted to it. Most likely, also, it was a barrier to armies, and indeed, to passengers generally, previous to and during the time of the Romans ; for, with the exception of some barrows on Brimpton common, about four miles west from Sil chester \u2014 and these, though just on the border, are not absolutely in it \u2014 there are few remains of antiquity to be found in it, with the exception of Silchester, some lines and square intrenchments near the heights, and the Ro man road along the summit-level from the hills near Ew hurst to Silchester. This was part of the line of com munication between Silchester and Old Sarum : it is al most wholly obliterated in the district of which we are speaking. Other evidences of this having been a close and marshy forest in the olden times, are afforded by the small number of churches in comparison of those in the southern valleys; and the fact that those which are met with, and also the principal villages, are near the heights, and not near the river, as is chiefly the case on the Itchen and on the Test. Up to a comparatively late period, also, there were many commons near the Emborne, and there are a few still. Of natural woods there are not now many, the ground being too rich and valuable for being allowed to lie idle ; but there are very many planted trees in rows, clumps, and"], [19, "7 THE NORTHERN SLOPE. extensive woodlands. The trees here are of much larger growth, and make more stem before they branch, than those in the south part of the county, though the tertiary forma tion occurs there again, forming the principal stratum along the shore from near Brighton to near Dorchester; and curving round in the middle part, on the Test, to within not more than twelve miles from Andover. The tertiary forma tion in the south is more gravelly than that in the north ; and this is one reason why timber attains a larger growth, especially in altitude, in the latter. Something however must be allowed for difference of atmosphere, \u2014 inasmuch as the whole tertiary region of the south, must be more or less affected by the sea air, from which the northern slope is free. But though the trees in this north part of the county are larger and more rapid in their growth than those in the southern part, they are not so durable in their tim ber, neither are they so well fitted for ship-building. A certain degree of softness, or sponginess, characterises the general vegetation of the tertiary clay-soils ; and the fruits and vegetables, though more abundant in quantity, are, gene rally speaking, not so racy in flavour. This is not entirely owing to the increased growth, though there is always some sacrifice of quality made in obtaining that. The damp, both in the soil and the atmosphere, \u2014 which is, however, one cause of the fertility \u2014 is the main agent of deteriora tion. That the timber of this part of Hampshire is not so well adapted for ship-building as that of the south of the county, is not much to be regretted, inasmuch as it could not be brought to any market, where it could be available for that purpose, except at considerable expense. It an swers well for local purposes however, and for these, as also for the ornamenting of the county, the rapid growth is an advantage. There is one other general circumstance connected with the climate of this part of Hampshire which is worthy of notice, and that is the motions of the local atmosphere, inde pendently of winds \u2014 those stealthy motions of the air from"], [20, "8 \u2022 THE NORTHERN SLOPE. place to place, along the surface in one direction, and in the upper air the other way, which displays no current to ordi nary observation. The low, or valley part of the district, from the retentive nature of its soil, and the rich vegetation with which great part of it is clothed, has a minimum varia tion of temperature, both daily and seasonal, for its geo graphical situation. The chalk hills, and their southern slopes, which extend along the whole district, have, on the other hand, a maximum variation of temperature in both respects. The consequence is, that the change to cold upon the hills sends down a dry air to the valley, and the change to heat upon them brings up a moist air from the same. In this way, the two kinds of soil are mutually beneficial ; as the valley is rendered less humid than it otherwise would be, and the hills are not so much parched. These remarks apply to all parts of Hampshire, and of every other locality, where low grounds of the same descrip tion as this district, lie at the bottom of chalk hills ; but as this is the most remarkable instance which comes within the scope of the present work, we have thought best to make our general remarks here. Having done so, we shall give a brief enumeration of the named places which are in the district ; and which are neither very numerous nor indi vidually very important. They are, however, just what they ought to be, quiet and rural, and ornaments, not ex crescences, in a rich agricultural district. Some of the mansions, with their demesnes and orna mental waters, form exceptions to this, but still, though they are beautiful, and have an air of magnificence both in their extent and their style, there is nothing sublime or even picturesque about them. Of the mansions, the most conspicuous is Highclere, a seat of the Caernarvon family ; the park of which, together with Pen wood to the north of it, form a belt across the country, from the highest part of the chalk ridge at Sidown, almost to the bank of the Emborne. This park is one of the most extensive in England ; the circuit of the whole of it"], [21, "9 THE NORTHERN SLOPE. being more than twelve miles ; but its form is irregular, and consequently its area does not amount nearly to that of a square of the same perimeter. The grounds are much more diversified than those of most mansions in the county, as they include Sidown hill, and also a large portion of ornamental water. We have already mentioned that Sidown hill is about 942 feet above the level of the sea. Highclere house is 587, which gives the hill an elevation of 355 feet above the mansion, and the distance is not more than a mile in horizontal extent. Thus, though the altitude would be insignificant in a mountainous country, it is considerable in such a county as Hampshire; and as the heights of the chalk ridges though naturally bare are not barren, this hill has been considerably improved ; and while it possesses no little beauty in itself, it contrasts well with the lower and richer part of the demesne. The grounds here were early acquired by the bishops of Winchester, and belonged to the church of that city in the time of Edward the Confessor. Indeed, it was in the times of the Saxon kings that the church acquired so much pro perty, especially in this part of England; where, for the maintenance of some establishment or other, it was by far the largest and the most wealthy proprietor. William of Wykeham had a house and park here ; frequently resided in the house, and appears to have been much attached to the place ; as he left a legacy to the minister of Highclere, and gave discretionary powers to his executors of rewarding the park-keeper. The bailiwick continued in possession of the bishops of Winchester even after the appropriation by Henry VIII ; but it was surrendered, together with the manors and free-warrens of Highclere and Burghclere, and the rights of advowson and patronage of the churches, to Edward VI, in 1552. This surrender was, in all proba bility, made at the suggestion of Williain Fitzwilliam, a gentleman of the bed-chamber to Edward ; for the whole was bestowed on him, a very short time after it was given up by Poynet, the then bishop of the diocese. In Mary's VOL. II. c"], [22, "10 THE NORTHERN SLOPE. reign, the greater part of the lands which had been sur rendered by the church, or violently taken from it, were again restored ; but the restoration was reversed by Eliza beth, or her ministers, in 1558. The contest between the reforming lords and the church, carried on during the reigns of Henry, Edward, and Elizabeth, were certainly reversals of the ancient acquisitions of property by the church ; but still, the motive, with which, however, we have no concern, seems to have been much the same in both cases \u2014 namely, the acquisition of large and important estates by persons who had not, in the usual acceptation of the term, any very legitimate title to them. The Caernarvon family did not receive the original grant, though their ancestors did receive a portion of the bishopric of Winchester as earls of Pem broke, which earls also acquired the rich lands of the ab bey of Wilton in the neighbouring county. Fitzwilliam first received Highclere ; but sold it to Sir Robert Sawyer, who was attorney-general to the last two monarchs of the Stuart family ; and his only daughter marrying the then earl of Pembroke, these estates passed to the second son, and then to his nephew, the then earl of Caernarvon ; and the Caernarvon family purchased the remainder of the bailiwick from the bishop of Winchester. The mansion is a modern one, commodious and not inele gant ; and some of the apartments are of spacious dimen sions. There are several good pictures in the mansion ; and altogether it may be considered a first-rate residence. Indeed, it is the only one of note in this particular dis trict of the county, great part of which belongs to the pro prietor of Highclere. Kingsclere is the only markeMown in this part of Hampshire. It is a small place, very rural in its aspect, and carrying on no trade except the supply of goods for the neighbouring farmers. It lies very near the chalk ridge, and about five miles to the eastward of Highclere. It is not upon any great thoroughfare, though there are several roads leading from it to the neighbouring districts. In an"], [23, ""], [24, "Km MUSCLE \u00a5i& BE ILL. BANTS. K 0 W <S S C L El \" HANTS"], [25, "11 THE NORTHERN SLOPE. agricultural point of view, the parish is rich as well as ex tensive, the rental being 8667^. and the population 3151. From its name, one would naturally infer that this had been a royal residence ; and such it was in the time of the West Saxon kings ; but all the memorials of royalty have been abolished ; and the park, which was situated on the slope of the hills about a mile south of the town, has been converted into a farm. We shall now very briefly enumerate the several parishes which have their churches or villages within the limits to which we have alluded. East Woodhay occupies the ex treme north-west of the district and the county, and it abuts upon the parish of West Woodhay in Berkshire. The Hampshire parish is rich and extensive, well diversified by patches of timber, and containing, besides the small village at the church, two larger villages ; Northend, about three quarters of a mile to the north, and Eastend, about as much to the east. Of course this parish extends the whole way from the hills to the Emborne. The population is 1268, and the rental about 5200-?. Highclere is the next parish to the eastward. It is not so populous as the former, great part of it being occupied by the park and woods of High clere house, within the former of which the parish church is situated. The parish contains 444 inhabitants, who pay a rental of upwards of 2000/. The parish of Newtown, on the borders of the county, and only two miles south-and by-east of Newbury in Berks, lies partly between Highclere and the river. The village is near, but not on the road from Whitchurch to Newbury ; and the parish is neither very rich nor very populous, the rental being about 600-?. and the number of inhabitants under 300. The church of Newtown is the only one in Hampshire which is situated near the bank of the Emborne river ; and this, together with the absence of churches on the Berkshire side, shows that the character of the immediate vicinity of this stream must have possessed few attractions for ecclesiastics at the time when churches and abbeys were first established. c2"], [26, "12 THE NORTHERN SLOPE. The remaining churches within the district are, like Wood hay and Highclere, near the chalk ridge ; and in this situ ation they occur at no great distances, although they are by no means so close as in the valley of the Itchen. Burgh clere is the first : the church and village of which are situ ated about a mile and a half to the eastward of Highclere, and about half that distance from Beacon hill and Ladle hill. The parish is pretty large and rich : the rental being nearly 5000/. and the population about 800; which is a high rent for the number of people, and shows that the parish is an agricultural one. There are a few cottages spotted here and there ; but no village of any consequence within the parish. Sidmonton lies about a mile east of Burghclere, and the church is within the domain of Sidmon ton house, a residence and manor which were granted to the Kingsmill family by Henry VIII. Seven hundred and sixty-four acres of the land of the parish belonged to Rom sey abbey before the dissolution of that establishment ; and the whole of this extent was rated at one acre of wheat and one acre of barley, in lieu of tithes. Itchingswell lies about a mile and a half north of Sidmonton, and like that parish does not contain a very great number of inhabitants. The next parish to the east is Kingsclere, to which we have al ready alluded ; about two miles to the eastward of Kings clere there is situated the parish of Wolverton, and about the same distance south-east of that, Ewhurst, near the top of the downs. Wolverton contains a population of about 230, who pay a rental of upwards of 1300/. Ewhurst con tains only 28 inhabitants, and the rental is less than 400/. Ewhurst, of course, means the height upon which the ewes were sent to graze. Pamber, about three miles east of Ew hurst, has a rental of about 1800/. and a population of nearly 500 ; and Pamber forest extends north-eastward, to ward the ruins of the ancient city of Silchester. In the intermediate space, and to the westward of Sil chester, are the parishes of Baughurst and Tadley ; the lat ter one of the poorest parishes in proportion to the number"], [27, "W, \u00a9 K T B N \u20ac C IK] U [& C 5\" jS JT T 5 LITTLE L@P3 b@N.

Much of the pa rish is occupied by commons. Monk's Sherborne, about a mile and a half south of Pamber, is a richer parish, though it includes a considerable part of the downs, and there is no village of consequence near the church. The rental of this parish is 2222/. and the population 522. The ground here belonged to a Benedictine monastery, which was founded by Henry de Port, in the reign of Henry I, and soon after transferred in property, first to the monastery of St. Vigor in Normandy, and then, on the dissolution of the alien priories, to the Domus Dei at Southampton, and finally it passed to Queen's college, Oxford, to which it still belongs. The fact of the early establishment of a re ligious fraternity here, shows that this part of the county was then much more inviting than that near the stream of the Emborne. The county here is very much diversified by small ine qualities of hill and dale, which lie within short distances of each other, and render the summit-level between the vale of the Emborne and those of the more easterly streams very difficult to be traced. The parishes of Monk's Sherborne, Pamber, and Silchester, lie partially on the upper parts of branches of the Loddon, and some of them upon branches of the Emborne ; and thus they belong alike to two of the natural divisions of the county. Silchester is a parish of considerable extent, that is to say, it contains more than 400 people, and the rental ex ceeds 2000/. ; but it derives more note from the former history and present remains of the old city, than it does from the present condition of the parish. In this respect it is one of the most remarkable ruins of fortified cities to be met with in England. It is the \" Caer Segont,\" or \" Caer Seyont,\" of the Britons ; the Vindonum, or rather, perhaps, the Vindunum of the Romans, \u2014 as the latter spelling of the name is the more expressive of its situation, which is on elevated ground, though not so much elevated as that which"], [32, "14 THE NORTHERN SLOPE. Old Sarum occupies. Silchester is the Saxon as well as the modern name ; though the city was demolished by the Saxons during the march of Ella toward Bath, after that leader had established himself in Sussex. Three Roman roads converge upon Silchester : one from Winchester, one from Old Sarum, and a third proceeds southwards from the centre of England. Where the ground has been brought into \"regular culture these Roman roads have been com- pletely obliterated ; but they can still be traced upon some of the commons and heaths. There are several entrench- ments without the great fortification of the city, and also some tumuli in the neighbourhood. A small village to the westward of the ruins is also called Soke, which would lead one to suppose that there had been suburbs when the city was in the days of its splendour. At present, however, and indeed, all along since toward the close of the fifth century, it has been decayed and tenantless, and without anything that could be considered as even a village. Who were the original founders of Silchester, it is impossible to say ; but the British name clearly points to it as being the principal strength or defensible residence of the Segontiaci ; but whe- ther they constructed any thing else but mud-walls is un- known. The stone wall, or at least what remains of it, is similar in construction to those of places where the Ro- mans, or Romanised Britons, are known to have had strong places. The situation is both strong and commanding ; and the summit still affords some very good views of the diver- sified country around. Unlike Old Sarum and other hill- forts on the chalk, there is water within the area of Silches- ter. This area is considerable, being about three furlongs each way, and in round numbers, the walls inclose a space which may be rated at about a seventh part of a square mile, or something about one hundred acres. This enclosure has been laid out in fields, and is cultivated. It also contains the parish church and church-yard, together with some farm buildings. It is not level, but slopes gradually to the south, with a small rill of water descending the slope ; and there"], [33, "15 THE NORTHERN SLOPE. are various little springs, which partially fill some parts of the remains of the ditches, except after long-continued drought. The remains of the walls vary in height in dif ferent parts, being as much as twenty feet toward the southern part of the enclosure, and less than fifteen in some other places. What remains of them is composed of rubble, or angular masses of stone of various kinds, strongly grouted with hard cement. These have been bonded by courses of larger and flatter stones, sometimes laid horizontally, and sometimes set herring-bone ways. There is some reason to believe, also, that great part of the walls may have been cased with freestone, inasmuch as masses of that have been dug up, with a portion of the rubble-work adhering to them by means of the cement. The form is a sort of irregular octagon, one side of which is directed due east. From the extremities of this, four sides are directed southward and three to the northward, the last of the northern ones being the longest of all the eight. Thus, though an irregular figure, Silchester does not belong to the same class as the round and oval hill-forts, even though we overlook the cir cumstance of its walls being made of stone cemented with lime. Still it is adapted to the form of the elevated knoll which it occupies, only the adaptation is, as much as possi ble, made in straight lines ; within the area, the situations of the principal streets of the old city can still be traced. Two main ones, broader than the rest, but not very broad, had led from the principal gates at the east, west, north, and south, and crossed each other near the middle of the area; and there are also smaller ones parallel to both of these. Thus, the plan of the buildings in Silchester has been much more regular than that of most of the very old cities, if we except such as were laid out by the Romans ; and this renders it probable that the Romans may have found this merely a mud-fort, and turned it to a walled city, in consequence of its commanding, and therefore advanta geous, situation. On the south side there has been a pos tern, or sally-port, of small dimensions ; and this is con-"], [34, "16 THE NORTHERN SLOPE. sidered by the rustics as having been the habitation of a giant, who hoarded in it the money of which he plundered the inhabitants around. This is of course wholly fabulous, but it is a very common fable, as in times of ignorance, man kind are prone to people with the ghost of a giant every ruin of the origin of which they know nothing, and sometimes to ascribe the erection itself to supernatural labour. That Silchester was a permanent and favourite residence, in times when the Romans were in this country, is proved by the existence of an amphitheatre without the walls, as well as by the number of coins and other Roman remains which have been found in and about the place. The am phitheatre is situated about five hundred yards north-east of the walls. This is constructed of clay and gravel, and not cemented with lime, as the walls of the city are. The banks are high and steep, about twenty yards in breadth at the bottom, and narrowing upwards to five feet, or there abouts, by five successive stages or steps. The bottom, or area, where the spectacles were shown, is now in great part covered with water, so that it cannot be very well examined ; and the foliage in a great measure conceals the other parts. The walls of the city are much better seen, and there are slight traces of a square and larger erection of some kind or other. Some fragments of hewn, and portions of inscribed stone, have been found, but none of them of much historical im portance ; Roman coins are far more numerous ; and it is said that fragments of statues and their pedestals have oc curred, both in alabaster and in common stone. The Ro man coins comprise those of every emperor from Julius to the last of the series, as long as they had any footing in this country. These coins have occurred of brass, of silver, and of gold ; and some of the authorities say, that British coins have also been found, but this wants confirmation. The assiduity with which such places were ransacked, when antiquarianism was as fashionable as geology is now, has reaped the greater part of the regular harvest of these arti-"], [35, "17 THE NORTHERN SLOPE. cles ; and such as are now met with are found accidentally more frequently than by those who search for them. Though it does not appear that Silchester was of any consequence as a Saxon town, or that it was even re-built after its demolition by Ella ; yet it must, as a matter of course, have been a point of thoroughfare for a long time afterwards. The fact of the Roman roads crossing it would render this the case, until the country had undergone those changes which slowly and gradually led to the establish ment of new lines, in situations quite different to those laid down by the Romans. Such is a rapid glance at Silches ter, one of the most celebrated, and also most ancient, ruins in England \u2014 a ruin which has remained in that condition for thirteen centuries and a half; and with it we shall close our brief survey of the northern slope of the county of Hants. Before doing so, however, and proceeding to another part of the county, of which the character is, in many respects, different, though it is mainly upon strata of the same formation ; we may mention, that this half of the valley of the Emborne differs, in some important natural circum stances, from every other district of Hampshire. It is chiefly on the tertiary formation, except in so far as that formation is blended with the chalk, at the foot of the ridge where the one overlays the other. The predominating cha racter of this district is clay, or clayey gravel, without any considerable portion of sand, such as we meet with in the extreme east of the county, and in the adjacent parts of Sur rey ; and, from the irregular ridge of knolls, which extends from the chalk downs to the boundary of the county, be tween the Emborne and the Loddon, we should be led to the conclusion that the eddying deluge, which carried the tertiary formation over the chalk in this part of England, had its motion westward, and that it had been gradually di minished in its velocity ; also, that the sand which forms the crag had been deposited before the water was purified from the clay contained in it. This is a different order of things VOL. II. u"], [36, "18 THE NORTHERN SLOPE. from what takes place on the estuaries of rivers ; for there, the clay is always deposited in a more inland situation than the sand ; and this difference in the deposition of the sand and the clay, shows clearly that no part of this tertiary formation can be a river deposit ; but that the whole of it must have been, in some way or other, produced by an action of the sea; and not by the first overflowing of the sea upon land which, although not inhabited by human beings, had still not been without its plants and its animals. The tertiary formation is incumbent on the chalk, which is also of marine origin ; the chalk is incumbent on the green sand, which is a marine formation also ; and the green sand is incumbent upon the wealden beds, which, in as far as they are water formations of any kind, are fresh-water for mations."], [37, "19 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. CHAPTER II. THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. This natural division of Hampshire is considerably more extensive than the northern slope, of which we have en deavoured to give an outline in the \"preceding chapter ; and it is also different in many of its physical characters, although at the imaginary line which we have supposed drawn from Rooksdown to Silchester, they run into each other, and the same kind of surface occurs for a little way in both. Berkshire forms the northern boundary of this division, as well as of the former \u2014 with the exception of a small part of Wilts, which lies in the fork made between the Loddon and the Blackwater rivers, before they unite into one general trunk. This part of Wilts comes in about four miles to the eastward of Silchester, and forms the boundary for about two miles ; and to the east of that there is ano ther smaller patch of Wilts, which forms the boundary for about half-a-mile. This latter portion is to the north of Bramshill common; and the Blackwater parts the two coun ties. The same river forms the boundary all the way to very near its source, which is in the hills behind Farnham, and the length for which it does form the boundary of Hampshire is about sixteen miles. It is irregular upon the hills, at Buckbury and Farnham beacon, and at these d 2"], [38, "20 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. heights the eastern boundary of this division, which is also that of the county, may be said to terminate; the river forming a pretty regular curve, concave towards Hampshire, and, of course, making that part of the county convex, with very few flexures except near its source. The southern and south-western boundaries are by no means so definite, as there are few running streams near the summits, and the surface of the ground is very much diversified. The heights behind Farnham are a continuation of the central chalk ridge, which forms the Guildford downs between that town and Farnham; but they do not attain any considerable elevation from the low grounds immediately adjacent to Farnham, until the heights already alluded to are arrived at ; and from them, the water-shed continues westward, in a very irregular line, until it reaches a point somewhere inter mediate between the valley of Basingstoke and to that of the Itchen. Though there is chalk in this district \u2014 more especially in the south of it, yet the greater part of it belongs to the tertiary formation, or consists of that formation worked into a calcareous loam, by an admixture of the chalk. We have already noticed that this forms one of the best natural soils, especially for plants that require much stimulus, and are at the same time of vigorous growth. Such lands are, of course, the best for hop-gardens ; and thus, many spots of the country here, both in Hampshire and in the adjacent parts of Surrey, are celebrated both for the quantity aud quality of that production. The town of Farnham, though in Surrey, is not two miles distant from Hampshire, either northward or westward ; and this part of the county, though it lies high, and is cold and bleak in many places during the winter, is beautiful in its scenery, and rich in its pro duce. It is also well wooded ; and the swells and hollows, hanging woods, open glades, rich fields and meadows, and rustic dwellings, make a very pleasing variety. Further to the north, a large extent of country bordering on Surrey, consists of heaths and moors, which are neither beautiful"], [39, "21 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. nor productive, but they are spotted with richer pieces wherever there is enough of clay or loam to make the crag or sand a little retentive. This is about the worst part of Hampshire in point of agricultural susceptibility ; but still much of it might be improved ; and, though the operation would be expensive, both to begin and to keep up, it would be fertile, and what it did produce would be of good quality. The general line or slope here is toward the river ; but in most places the surface is flat, with only sandy knolls here and there. A little south from the London road, between Blackwater, on the border of the county, and Hartley Bridge, where the same road crosses the Loddon, there are some small hills, with Hartford Bridge flats, Yadley heath, and Everley com mon, extending in dull uniformity, to the north of them. It is along these flats that the great London road to Basing stoke passes. There are, indeed, three great lines of com munication across this uninteresting part of the county : the Basingstoke canal, in the southern part of the district, pursuing an exceedingly winding course, but lying nearly on a level, and therefore requiring few locks ; the Southampton railway, proceeding in almost a straight line from Basing stoke along the middle ; and the great road from London to the southern parts of the west of England, crossing far ther north. All these three meet together at Basingstoke, where the canal terminates, while the others continue on ward to the great ports in the south-west. Upon the Black water, or boundary of the county, the road is about three miles north of the railway, and the canal about four miles south. But the canal winds so much that it lies parallel to the river, and crosses the railway, or rather, is crossed by it, only three-quarters of a mile eastward of the point where that leaves the county. About four miles within the county, the railway passes Fleet-pond, an irregular pool of stagnant water, measuring nearly a quarter of a mile in area ; but it is dull and uninteresting, from the flatness of the surface and the poverty of the soil around it. Formerly there were"], [40, "22 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. but few lines of communication across these flats, \u2014 the only ones of much traffic, being the London road, already alluded to, and the Farnham one which joins that at Bagshot. The local roads were few and bad, as there was nothing to pay for making them ; and the country was in consequence, to a very considerable extent, a wilderness. The canal, we believe, has not greatly improved the state of things ; but expectations are entertained from the railroad, and they may be, to a considerable extent, realised ; at least if we may judge from the improvements that have taken place along the great lines of turnpike road where the ground is of a similar character. Lines of communication for the transfer of passengers, necessaries, and produce, are the be ginnings of improvements in all countries ; and when they are properly kept up, improvement always follows ; nor is there any reason to apprehend that it will stand still here. From the heights behind Farnham, the line of water-shed may be taken between the valley of the Wey at Alton on the south, and the town of Odiham on the north, all the way westward to Windmill hill, where the slope to the Wey at Alton meets that to the Itchen at Alresford. This hill is one of the most bleak and elevated spots in the county \u2014 at least of any over which a great public road passes ; and from causes afterwards to be explained, it is very subject to fogs. From Windmill hill, the natural boundary trends north-west, and in the direction of the meeting of the val leys of the Whitchurch Test and the Loddon, a little to the west of Basingstoke, being in the direction of Rooksdown, or the camp on Winklebury hill ; and thence to Silchester, the boundary is the same as that of the district noticed in the preceding chapter. Such are the natural boundaries of this district, stated with sufficient accuracy for the common purposes of 7efe rence and description ; and their length may be summed up by a rude approximation as follows ; Winklebury to Sil chester, north-eastward, about six miles ; Silchester, along the border of Berkshire, and a patch of Wiltshire to the"], [41, "23 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. Blackwater, eastward, about six miles ; sixteen miles along the Blackwater, with Berks and then Surrey on the opposite side \u2014 these two rivers meeting exactly where the London road crosses the river ; south-westward, for about four miles of a very irregular line, to the boundary of Surrey about two miles north-west of Farnham ; south-westward, about eleven miles, to Windmill hill ; and then north-westward, for about twelve miles, to Winklebury or Rooksdown. These lines are however, very irregular, and cannot be made the basis of any estimate ofthe quantity of surface; but physical de scription, and not mere extent, being our present object, these statements are sufficient. We have already adverted to the extent of sandy heaths and peat bogs, situated to the westward of the Loddon in this county, as well as to the eastward of it in Berks and Surrey ; and these may be considered as one of the extre mities and extremes of character of the district, whose phy sical action, and its effects upon the climate, and the fer tility of the surface, we shall endeavour to explain. The other extremity consists of the southern and western heights ; highest, as we have said, in the general level in the neigh bourhood of Alton ; terminating eastward within the dis trict, and trending north-westward toward the summit-level in the northern valley near Basingstoke. The general slope, therefore, of the whole district, without reference to the minor diversifications of its surface, is toward the north and north-east ; and there are three principal rivers, or branches of one river, the Loddon, which flow in this direction. First, there is the Blackwater, bordering the county, but travers ing the heaths and mosses. Secondly, there is the White water, which rises a few miles south-west of Odiham, and pursues a winding course of about ten or eleven miles to where it joins the Loddon, on the boundary of the county ; and -thirdly, there is the Loddon itself, which rises a mile or two to the west of Basingstoke, and flows north-westward for fourteen or fifteen miles, including the windings ; but the other two branches do not meet this one within Hamp-"], [42, "24 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. shire. The courses of these rivers necessarily determine the positions of their several valleys, and all of them are joined by little brooks, which meet them nearly at the same angles as they meet each other. Thus the whole surface is divided into a series of primary, and another of secondary valleys, as regards the county, but in themselves only branches, and very small branches of the great valley of the Thames. In the south-western part, there is a very considerable breadth without any perennial running water, and this may be re garded as the table-land of Hampshire, though it is very much broken by hill and dale, well clothed with wood in many places ; excellent corn-land in others ; and, generally speaking, a rich, as well as a beautiful country. The names \" Blackwater,\" and \" Whitewater,\" are very well descriptive of the portions of the district through which they flow ; or, at all events, they indicate the tinge given to the water by the soil. The Blackwater is a pure stream among the heights behind Farnham ; but when it reaches the flats and moors it becomes tinged with peat. On the other hand, there is little or no peat on the course of the Whitewater ; and accordingly its colour and qualities resemble those of the rivers described in our first volume, only, perhaps, this river is not so pure and limpid. The Loddon is also a transparent river, compared with the Blackwater ; and the valley of it is, for the most part, rich and beautiful. The local action of the atmosphere is carried on be tween these elevated and generally fertile heights in the south and west parts of the district, and the flat heaths and moors on the north and east These moors of tertiary formation, even where they are composed of crags, do not drink up the water which falls upon them so thirstily as the moors on the green sand, south of this ridge of the chalk. This is the cause of the growth of mosses, the thirsty sands being in general covered with short heath only, with little or no moss upon the surface ; and the decom posed moss reacts and increases the tendency of the surface to resist the entrance of the rain which falls upon them."], [43, "25 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. This prevents the water from getting into the sand; and thus the soil is dry and warm below, which causes the rain that falls on the general surface to be rather speedily eva- porated. Then, the droughts tell strongly upon them ; and at such times their dark surfaces become considerably heated; but when there is dampness upon the surface, there is a diminished radiation of heat. Accordingly, taken upon the average of the seasons, these mossy flats are rather cold ; and the surface-action of the sun upon them does not vary so much, either with the day or the season, as it does upon the dry heights. The consequence is, that there is a general tendency of the atmosphere from the moors to the heights, just as there is from the water-meadows to the downs in the southern parts of the county. As is the case there, the air steals upward to the heights during the clay, when these are heated, and remains a dry atmosphere while the heat conti- nues ; but, as the heat subsides during the night, heavy dews are formed in the summer ; and fogs, more dense than even on the flats themselves, are produced in the winter. There is another cause which tends to increase the winter fogs upon those heights, and that is the meeting of the atmosphe- ric actions of the east and west sides of the county. The point of meeting, and of maximum effect of the two atmos- pheres, depend of course on the relative degree of their sepa- rate actions ; but upon the average, it is at or near the prin- cipal summit-levels ; because it is upon those that the cold air of the night has the greatest tendency to come down. So also, these heights, which in most places consist of a stratum of gravel or gravelly clay, more or less thick over the chalk, are both more absorbent and more radiant of heat than the chalky downs upon which there is no gravel. The radiation of heat during the night keeps the surface thus warmer than the air over it can bear ; and thus the fog forms to a considerable height ; and it is dense, in proportion to the difference of temperature between the two, and the quantity of moisture in the descending air, jointly. In corro boration of this, it may be mentioned as the result of obser- VOL. II. E"], [44, "26 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. vation, that the winter fogs are always most dense upon the most elevated parts of these summits, and upon those where the situation is nearest to the parting of the eastern and the western slopes:\u2014 for instance, on the London road from Farnham to Winchester, the fogs are most dense about Wind mill hill ; and they are also very dense on the heights be tween Odiham and Alton, more so than in the interjacent hollows. These fogs are disagreeable for night travellers, and not wholly without danger to those who ride in fast going carriages over a country so very hilly, and where ascents and descents alternate with each other at such short distances. But this fog has none of the pungent qualities which the fogs of London derive from the saline and sul phureous vapours which that great city sends up, neither have they any, or at least not much, of the pestilent nature of that demon, miasma, which rides somewhat mysteriously on \"the reek o' the rotten fens.\" To vegetation they are decidedly favourable, as they water it in a more gentle manner, and one in which the whole plant is more completely saturated than it could be in a heavy fall of rain. They also retain the rich particles of decomposing vegetables, which heavy rains are apt to wash away, or carry down into the subsoil. Thus the fogs are a watering given to the ground, of which that ground receives the full benefit, without being injured by the receiving of it. They do not very often extend far down the valleys of the western rivers ; and so, when the fog is very dense upon the hills to the east, there is not a particle between Alresford and Winchester. Along the other lines it is much the same, the fogs being very seldom thick upon the west sides of the principal summits. The coldness of the eastern flats is one of the chief causes of the preva- lence of these fogs, and also of the superiority of the crops upon the good lands in this part of the county. In other states of the atmosphere, rain is produced upon these heights, but the rains there are not so heavy in proportion to those between the places where they fall and the sea, as they are in the central counties of England. The soil and surface-"], [45, "27 THE NO^TH-EASTERN SLOPE. vegetation change so much, however, at short distances in this diversified part of the county, that it is by no means easy to frame a general description that will apply to the whole. Before we can have a full understanding of the manner in which the atmosphere of such a district works, we must attend to the character of the grounds for some distance around it, in all directions \u2014 north and south, as well as east and west. North-west, there is the chalk ridge between the upper part of the valley of the Loddon and the northern slope of the county. As far as this continues it forms a sort of barrier to the general current of the atmosphere ; at least to the portion of it which is nearest the surface of the ground. Hence, in all cases, excepting those of very strong general gales which sweep everything before them, and, for the time, obliterate all the minor local motions of the air, there is a play of that fluid between the chalky ridge, and the rich grounds about Basingstoke. In summer, when the hills are dry, and heated, and heating the air over them, they draw up the air from the fields, meadows, and woods below, and prevent that stagnation of the air which is un favourable to the health of plants as well as animals. We know much less of the process of aeration, or breathing, in vegetables than in animals, because we are not acquainted with any specific organ, or set of organs, by means of which the operation is carried on, \u2014 any more than we know what specific matter, obtained from the earth or the atmosphere, forms the food of plants. There have been speculative theories formed upon both subjects ; but they are, one and all, grounded upon animal analogies ; and therefore they are of no value for practical purposes. We do know, however, that none of the plants which are valuable to man, either for himself, or for domestic animals, can live without atmos pheric air ; and that, if they have not free exposure to this air, they are always inferior in quality, whatever they may be in quantity. We also know that many living and grow ing things, in whose economy the air is necessary, must e 2"], [46, "28 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. have that air changed ;, for it is a general law in the breath ing of all that breathe, be the mode and the means what they may, that the residuum of air which has been once breathed, is unfit for being breathed again. It is the same with that humidity which is equally essential to vegetation. Plants must be watered in some way or other ; but a con tinual soaking is injurious to all the more kindly land plants ; and it is especially unfavourable that the surface of a plant should be coated with a pellicle of water when the hot rays of the sun are beating upon it. Independently of the absorption of moisture by the plant, a certain quantity, varying with the nature of the plant, and with many other circumstances, must be evaporated from its surface, in order to keep it in a healthy tone. If this is not afforded, the plant shrivels up, as we find in the grass upon dry and dew less fields in the hot months of summer. The cause of this is easily seen : the plant works in its growing, by means of the properties of humidity and heat \u2014 there are others, in deed, but these are the chief ones, and all that are neces sary for our purpose ; some adjustment of these to each other must be favourable to the most healthy growth of every plant; and, as there are plants suited to all situations and climates, the proportion must vary in each species. The degree of variation is a matter of observation for the practical cultivator; but the truth of the principle is un questionable. \u2014 Water-cress, for instance, cannot be made to grow on a dry down, or wild thyme in a stream of water. The common agricultural, culinary, and timber plants, are those which are most valuable to man \u2014 and most orna mental to the country upon the large scale. Now, they are all what may be called medium plants, in respect both of solar action and of humidity ; and thus they never can grow in the most profitable manner if these are not in something like the proper ratio to each other, \u2014 or when both are in excess, or deficient. If humidity is in excess, the quality of the growth is bad ; and if the excess gets beyond a certain degree, the plant languishes, turns blanched and yellow for"], [47, "29 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. want of the requisite portion of carbon ; and, if matters are still pushed farther, its growth and texture are both de stroyed. Light, as well as free air, is essential to the healthy carbonization of a plant ; and this lets us see that the plant absorbs the carbon in the form of carbonic acid gas ; because oxygen is given out by the action of light ; and as light always tends to increase the proportion of car bon, it follows, as a matter of course, that the action of the light throws off the oxygen and leaves the carbon behind. It is carbon \u2014 which in itself is one of the most incorruptible of substances \u2014 which gives strength and durability to the timber of trees, and their most nutritious quality to all vegetables which are used either as the food of man or of domestic animals. En passant, this is the reason why the sheep fed on the dry downs of the south of England, or upon the mountains of Wales or Scotland, yield mutton so supe rior in the flavour of the muscle, and especially of the fat, and so rich and racy in the juice, as compared with that which is grown upon rank pastures in the humid parts of the country ; and it is necessary to a proper understanding of the natural working of such a county as Hampshire that we keep all these little circumstances in view. If the proportion of humidity, as compared with that of heat and light and aerial action, be but a little deficient, the quantity of growth in the plant is diminished, and the qua lity increased. If the deficiency is greater, the plant be comes stunted; and if carried still farther, it is parched and perishes. Farther, if all the kinds of action to which the plant is exposed, are in excess as compared with the consti tution of the plant, even though the proper balance to each other is preserved, the plant works unfavourably for agri cultural purposes ; and though it may be large in size, it is deficient in fruitfulness. For this reason, our common grain-plants cannot be grown in the rich fields of tropical countries ; for if there is humidity enough for their growth, they run up to stem, and produce little or no grain. For a similar reason, barley and oats, especially the latter, which"], [48, "30 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. is the more northerly, or, at all events, the most upland na tive, are very inferior upon the low-lying and rich lands of England, to what they are upon the dry hills, or in Scot land. Bearing in mind the general facts or principles embodied in these paragraphs, let us return to the district of Hamp shire under notice, and begin with that part of it by which we were led to make these remarks \u2014 remarks of first-rate importance to every inhabitant of an agricultural county, whether proprietor, farmer, or consumer. The warm air, ascending from the top of the dry chalk ridge, when that is beaten upon by the summer sun, ascends, and draws up the more weighty and more humid air from the rich grounds to the southward. By this means, the vegetation is relieved from that excess of moisture which its leaves or other work ing structures have accumulated during the night. This is a daily operation in the growing months, but it is a gentle one, and often imperceptible ; because, though the humidity should be in such abundance as to appear a light summer fog in the bottoms, it melts away into the more dry air over the heights, which, under such circumstances, is actually warmer than that over the hollows. This continues, as long as the strength of the sun beats upon the hill, \u2014 upon the thin and comparatively dry vegetable covering of which, it tells, of course, much more strongly than upon the corn-fields, mea dows, and woods below, where there is more humidity to evaporate, and where the surface of the earth itself is much more in shadow. Sometimes, however, these light summer mists may be observed stealing slowly up the slopes ; but they never actually settle upon the summits, as is the case with those air-formed fogs which appear in clouds upon the mountain tops, as harbingers of rain. What has now been stated is one part of the local action in this natural section of Hampshire, and in all places which have their surfaces similarly diversified in form, in composi tion, and irr- produce ; for, though we have taken the chalk ridge and the valley at Basingstoke as our particular exam-"], [49, "31 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. pie, on account of the strong contrast which they form to each other, the same kind of action goes on between all the varied surfaces of the country, in proportion to the diffe rences of character between the elevation and the hollow. In principle, this is the same as the few remarks which we made in our first volume, upon the action between the water-meadows upon the southern rivers, and the downs which form the boundaries of their valleys. But here, espe cially in the south-west of the district toward Odiham and Alton, it takes place simply between height and hollow, without the assistance of any water-meadows, or any streams by means of which these can be formed. It is true that there are water-meadows upon some parts of all the three branches ofthe Loddon, and of course wherever these exist, the action between them and the intervening dry downs will be much the same. It is not, however, the circumstance of water-meadows and downs, or even that of heights and hol lows, by which the action is produced. These are circum stances favourable to its production no doubt ; but they are not the primary causes. Two surfaces, each of some extent, the one much less susceptible of change of temperature by the action of the same solar influence, are all that is requi site ; and a field out of crop with the surface naked, and a wood or field covered with close vegetation of any kind which shadows the ground from the solar beams, have pre cisely the same action upon each other, though not to the same extent ; and this is one reason why fields under diffe rent crops, or under crops which come to maturity at different seasons, tend of themselves to improve the climate, and even the soil, where husbandry is carried on in a skilful manner. It is true that the rotation of crops has other advantages, which are more obvious to the agriculturist, though not in themselves more valuable than these less obvious ones. The same artificial crop cannot be grown to the greatest advantage upon the same spot, even for two consecutive sowings ; because there is always a tendency in highly-bred plants to relapse back to the native original ; and change of"], [50, "32 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. crop, as well as change of seed, from one district to another, is the means of preventing degeneracy. Upon extensive plains, where the soil as well as the surface is uniform, the local action depends in a great measure upon the farmer; but hilly grounds, varied soils, and admixtures of woodland, down, and meadow, among the lands under culture, such as occur in so many parts of Hampshire, perform in them selves a great part of the work, and lighten the labour of the farmer in this way, just as they do in that of drainage. These are among the grand natural advantages of the county; and it is pleasing to reflect that a county, whose chief value is agricultural, should have so many natural advantages for the easy and successful carrying on of that foremost and most essential of all the arts. The alternation which takes place in the absence of the sun, and which is just the reverse of what is effected by the presence of the luminary, condenses the air and brings it down upon the low places. As it cools and descends, its evaporative power diminishes; and night fogs (not un wholesome, for they are air-formed, and thus consist of pure water in its most liquid state,) are produced, or dew is formed upon the surface of all the vegetation. By either of these, the growth is much more promoted, than if the hu midity were to come in the shape of rain ; and hence the little grassy grades retain their greenness, and the crops on them their freshness, during droughts which burn Up the grass, and turn the grain crops sickly in the leaf, up6n ex tensive and uniform plains. In the autumn, when the corn-fields are cleared, and their plantless surfaces exposed to the action of the sun, they take the place, or rather perform the office which is performed by the dry heights, when the valleys are in the vigour of their greenness. In the earlier autumnal months, by the calendar, which months, or at least many weeks of them, are commonly very dry and very warm in such a county as Hampshire, when the sun acts powerfully upon the naked fields during the, day \u2014 and they cool as rapidly"], [51, "33 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. during the night \u2014 night-fogs are formed upon the ground, which refresh the meadows, and the turnip and other crops still in growth ; and also favour the ripening of the buds on fruit and timber trees, which would be too much forced into premature hardening were the night as dry as the clay. These fogs rise higher than the light fogs of summer, reaching a good way up the slopes of the hills, and some times as high as the summits \u2014 especially where those sum mits are of such comparatively trifling elevation as they are here and in most parts of Hampshire. While these fogs are so serviceable to vegetation, they are not unhealthy either for man or for animals ; and the appearance of them, especially in the hilly part of the dis trict we are noticing, is often exceedingly beautiful, just at a little after sunrise, about the end of August or the early part of September. The best position for seeing this pleas ing phenomenon to advantage, is to get to one of the most elevated points, and look athwart the country to the rising sun. In such a situation, the upper surface of the fog is as level as that of the tranquil sea; and, it is dense enough for reflecting a considerable portion of the light of the sun, and thus of having much the appearance of water, only the colour of it is more subdued and delicate. At first it fills every hollow, so that only the hill tops are seen ; and as there is a slight mist upon them, that mist has the same effect as an additional quantity of air ; and thus, a mile or two of prospect is magnified to an immense horizon, by the magical effect of this peculiar kind of aereal perspective. As the sun ascends, and the light beats more directly upon the fog, it melts away ; still preserving a uniform level, as if this mimic ocean were ebbing down into some subterranean cavern. As this proceeds, new summits, and trees, and copses, and cottages, with a church-tower here and there, make their appearance. As they appear, they advance, from the increasing transparency of the air ; and, by the time the last lingering portion of the air-supported sea has vanished from the hollows, the landscape has approached VOL. II. F"], [52, "34 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. you, to within a fraction of its original distance, and all its features are as clear and graphic as can well be imagined. Such is the aspect of an autumnal-morning mist among the lovely little hills of this part of Hampshire. Few phe nomena can be more pleasing to a lover of nature \u2014 none are more frequent or more easily observed; and the observer has the satisfaction of knowing, that this gentle and beauti ful display works wholly for good. It is true, that these morning fogs are not unfrequently followed by showers in the course of the day ; but such showers are of considerable value in swelling the turnips, causing the newly-sown wheat to spring up and cover the clods, and in improving the last swathe upon the hay-field, and the grass upon the pastures, \u2014 all of which tend to the economising of the winter storey and the promise of the future crop. The ready action of surface upon surface, in such varied districts as this, is also productive of advantages to vegeta tion in the more advanced period of autumn, and in winter. Flatter and less varied regions are far more subject to hoar frosts, where the forming dew congeals upon the leaf and bud, and is melted again by the heat of the sun. The buds are pretty safe in those hybernacula which nature provides for their special protection ; but, upon, the growing plants, more especially the young ones, the action is too severe for not being injurious. The freezing upon the plant produces a certain degree of heat ; and if the fluids within the plant are frozen, they expand, and injure its more delicate tis sues. Then, if the ice upon them is suddenly thawed, the cold contracts them, and the plants are injured before the contents have had time to thaw. This is the reason why many culinary vegetables boil more tenderly after they have been touched by frost ; but, though this may be better for the vegetable, when it is to be thawed in. cold water and then dressed, yet the effect upon the living vegetable is very different. The flesh of animals, especially of wild ones, in which the fibre is naturally more rigid than in tame ones, is more tender and more esteemed in its incipient putre-"], [53, "35 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. scence than when it is fresh ; but a living animal in the same state would be at the gates of death. Another circumstance, in which the peculiar nature and form of the surface of this and other hilly parts of Hamp- shire, and to all countries of similar character, are favourable to their wholesome fertility as agricultural, is the readiness with which snow is formed, at a comparatively early part of the season. The formation of snow in the air has, in some measure, the very opposite effect upon vegetation to that which is produced by the formation of hoar-frost or ice upon the plants themselves. The freezing of moisture in the air, always produces heat in that element, by disengaging that action of heat which had previously kept the water liquid, and in a state of vapour ; thus the falling snow does not cool the vegetation, or the earth on which it falls, to the same extent as water which is frozen there. Indeed, unless in so far as it melts as it falls on the surface, it has no ac- tive cooling effect whatever ; and if it falls in sufficient quantity, and lies for some time, it warms the ground under it. It does so in this way : \u2014 snow is a very bad conductor of heat ; and by this means, when the sun shines upon it, it assists in warming the air, as well as in preserving the warmth of the ground. The rays of the sun are not ab- sorbed by the snow ; they are reflected into the atmosphere, and produce more effect there, by this double action, than if they acted only once. The earth under the snow, is always, even at a very small depth, much above 32\u00b0 of the common thermometer, the temperature at which snow is formed ; and when the snow-shower is formed in the air over the height, and blows thence to the warmer hollow, it often falls there before there is any effect of frost upon the sur- face, or at all events, when the effect of that frost is exceedingly small. True, it seldom continues, when the surface on which it falls is not at all touched by frost ; and yet, if the fall is considerable, the melting of that which falls first, will often cool the surface to such an extent as that it will preserve the rest unmelted. As long as the snow lies, f 2"], [54, "36 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. the vegetation under it is protected from all injury, and not only so, but the roots and also the leaves will grow, and some plants will flower under the snow. It is the early fall and the long continuance of snow, in countries far to the north, which makes the summer vegetation so rapid and so vigorous there ; and, what geographical position does to these regions, is done, to some extent, by the form of the surface, and the nature of the soil, in such districts as the hilly parts of Hampshire. It is true that the spring is pro tracted by the circumstances last-mentioned ; but this, when not too great, is an advantage. Too early springs, in a country of such variable climate as that of England, are the most dangerous seasons that the farmer can meet with ; for what is done in March in the way of growth, is in great danger of being undone in April and May. This blending of great variety of climates and seasons, like the blending of soils and surfaces, is of great value to those regions in which it takes place, in the beauty of their scenery, as well as in the productiveness of their soil, and the quality of what it produces. The hints which have now been given, and which are all our limits will admit of, are absolutely necessary for un derstanding, and in so far answering, each of the three great questions which form the main subject of the present work, \u2014 namely, what Hampshire has been in times past, what it is at the present time, and what it is likely to be come in future. The natural capabilities of the county are the essential data for the solution of each and all of these questions ; though there are others, which blend with and modify them, more especially as concerns the past. Of these modifying causes, some have been political ; some what may be termed civil, as arising out of changes in the information, the occupations, and the commercial relations, of other parts of Britain, and of the rest of the world ; and some are natural, or owing to physical changes. The poli tical ones belong chiefly to the past, as there is now little chance that any political change shall have that general"], [55, ""], [56, "KIE'. FJiOM I II \\rll- HILL"], [57, "37 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. effect upon society which such changes once had ; and the rest are more applicable to the present and the future. \u2014 But we must proceed with our topographical sketch of the dis trict ; and allude to the more argumentative, but more use ful matters, incidentally only, as occasion may justify. The superior nature of the soil and climate of this divi sion of Hampshire, with the exception only of the flats near the Blackwater, has led to the constructing of a good many splendid parks and residences; and some of these are of the first order. The towns in it are but few, and none of them very large ; and Basingstoke and Odiham are the only ones which are regular market-towns, and polling-places for the northern parliamentary division of the county, \u2014 as Kings clere is the only markets-town and polling-place in the north ern slope, which was described in the preceding chapter. Basingstoke, though not of the same importance now, relatively to the rest of the county, as it was in former times, is, and must always be, a place of considerable im portance ; and one, the importance of which is likely, nay certain, to increase every day. It possesses several advan tages over most of the other small towns of the county. Its situation is very beautiful ; and the land about it very rich \u2014 many fields being of sufficient quality for the produc tion of hops ; and the crops upon most .of the surface are of the highest order. Thus, a great deal of farm-produce, \u2014 far more than is necessary for the supply of the town and neighbourhood, is raised every year, and brought to the corn-market in the town, which is well supplied and well attended. Then, Basingstoke enjoys the advantage of being a greater thoroughfare than any other town in the inland parts of Hampshire; or, indeed, in the south of England. From the south and west, the great roads through Salisbury, Andover, and Whitchurch, through Stockbridge, and through Winchester, are concentrated upon it; as are also various other roads upon the north and south, all of which meet in the great road to London. Then the canal originates here ; and though its length is very great, as compared with the"], [58, "38 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. direct distance between its extremities, that is, between Basingstoke and Ham Haw common, where the canal merges in the navigation of the Wye; yet the lockage is inconsiderable as compared with the length of the line ; and thus the canal is of great advantage for the carriage of farm produce, and all other heavy goods where the slow progress of the navigation is a matter of minor importance. Could this canal be carried across the summit-level to the Whit church branch of the Test, a most important line of water carriage would have been established ; but this is impracti cable, both on account of the deep cutting which would be requisite, and of the want of water at the summit. Still, it is doubtful whether Basingstoke suffers much from being at the terminus of its canal, because it thereby becomes a place at which the canal-borne goods, both to and from the metropolis, are stored ; and this gives a good deal of bustle and employment, and consequent profit to the inhabitants. The advantages of the canal, like those of its position and its productive vicinity, are such that Basingstoke can never lose them \u25a0 as no other canal, south of that which joins the navigations of the Kennet and Avon can, from the nature of the country, come in competition with it \u2014 nor can indeed be so constructed as to work at all. Further south, the Wye and the Itchen approach to within no very great distance of each other, but to join them by a water-communication, presents even greater difficulties than the junction of the Loddon and the Whitchurch branch of the Test. One of the greatest advantages which Basingstoke derives from the canal, besides the export of raw farm-produce, and of malt \u2014 which is now the chief manufacture of the town, is the fetching of coal, which may come from the port of London, or from some of those places on the Thames where midland coal is brought for sale, cheaper than the sea-borne coal from London, but inferior in quality for domestic purposes. The line of the Basingstoke canal is also very convenient for the town of Odiham, as it passes the high-road only about a half-a-mile to the north. At Grrevill hill, about"], [59, "39 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. two miles to the west of Odiham, the canal passes through a tunnel of about three-quarters of a mile in length. The London and Southampton railway passes a very little to the north of Basinstoke, so little indeed, that it is more convenient, as well as more safe, than if it had passed through the middle of the town ; and when that line of communication shall come into full play, with its projected branches to Salisbury on the west, and Portsmouth or Gos port on the east, there is no doubt that Basingstoke will derive some advantage from it, though it may diminish the quantity of goods now carried on the canal. The advantage which it will derive will, of course, be that for which its situation best adapts it \u2014 the collection and distribution of pas sengers, and of goods for the supply of the district by which it is more immediately surrounded. Besides this, the rail way, as a new and more rapid means of transit than those formerly in use, will increase the traffic ; but of course it will lessen the employment of coaches and wagons upon the lines of road that lead to places at which the railway touches. Two hours and a half will amply suffice to transfer passen gers from London to Basingstoke, or up again, so that there will be no expense on the road other than the fare of the train. This will be the case also to Southampton and to Salisbury, and the saving of time will be one half as com pared with the rate of the fastest coaches now on the road. It is probable that, in the Saxon times, and also in those of the earlier Normans, Basingstoke was a place of inferior importance to Basing, now Old Basing, a little farther down the Loddon. This is rendered probable, by the name stoke ; for though \" stoke,\" literally means a stake, or stakes driven into the ground, as steps whereby to cross a river, or for any other purpose,* \u2014 being the same as the word \"stick\"; yet it was frequently applied to hamlets, in which the houses and the chapels or the churches, when they possessed these, were constructed of sticks, or posts and wattles, and not of stone, in some style of architecture or other; as appears to have been the case with the strongholds and principal pa-"], [60, "40 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. rish churches, at least in the time of the later Saxons, and in some situations for many years before the Saxon invasion. According to the assessment in 1831, the town and parish ot Basingstoke contained a population of 3581, with a valued rental of 11,382/., which is considerably greater than the rental of the town of Romsey, though the population is nearly two-fifths less. This comparatively high ratio of the population to the rental, evinces a superiority, in some re spect or other, on the part of Basingstoke, and one feels dis posed to attribute this partly to its being a greater thorough fare, and partly to its greater distance from any towns which can come into competition with it. That it arises chiefly from the greater intercourse, is proved by the fact of the rapid increase of the population of Basingstoke, which has been about forty per cent, in the thirty years from 1801 to 1831. The town, though not parliamentary, is corporate ; governed by a mayor, recorder, seven aldermen, capital bur gesses, and so forth ; and besides its weekly market on every Wednesday, fairs are held in it on the Wednesday in the Whitsun-week, and on the tenth of October. The principal buildings are on the line of the London roads to Winchester and Whitchurch ; but there is also a considerable extent along the north roads to the downs, and the south road to Alton. The town is rustic in its general appearance ; but it contains many good houses, and there is an air of com fort and thriving about it. The town-hall is modern, and that and the market are neat and commodious. The parish church is large and not unhandsome, constructed of stone on the south side, and of alternate stone and flint on the north. The tower is low, though square and massy, but the structure is not a very ancient one. The manor belonged to the Crown at and before the time when Doomsday book was drawn up ; and, as a royal manor, it was exempted from taxes. The parsonage of the church and that of Old Basing belonged, in common with those of most churches in Hants, to the bishop of Salisbury; but they were made over to the priory of Selborne, when Peter de Rupibus took to abbey-"], [61, ""], [62, "'BASDK1\u20acST\u00a9KE CHURCH, HANTS.

When the brethren of that institution had irreclaimably wandered from the right path, and could not be brought back again either by pope or bishop, so that they had to be abolished, the advowson of both churches was transferred to the col lege of St. Mary Magdalene, as an appropriate votive offer ing at the shrine of that immaculate saint. They still re main in the gift of the college ; and the vicarage of Basing stoke is a rich living. This was not the only foundation in Basingstoke ; for, at the suggestion of the founder of Mer ton college, Oxford, Henry III founded an hospital here, for the support of worn-out and useless fellows and scholars ofthe said college. This college has, however, become ex tinct, and the building is nearly obliterated. Another an cient remain here, or, at all events, trace of a remain, near the burial ground where the railway passes, was the chapel of the Holy Ghost, erected in the time of Henry VIII, and now ruined and nearly obliterated. Besides these establish ments, there is a free-school in the town, and a charity school, some of the boys attending which are supported by the Skinner's Company in London. As Basingstoke lies in a situation where an army could more easily pass from the west to the east, than by any other route, near it, either on the north or the south ; it is understood to have been the scene of sundry contests, especially between the Saxons and the Danes ; but the records of these contests are few, and like the other historical facts that rest on the authority of the monkish chroniclers, they are not to be implicitly de pended upon. As the church and village of OldBasing are situated only about two miles to the eastward, or down the Loddon, from Basingstoke, and as the site of Basing house, a place of some story, is but a little way to the south-west of the church and village, we may take some notice of them before we proceed to mention the market-town of Odiham. Old Ba sing is rather a wealthy and populous parish, lying on the rich grounds near the river ; and containing a population of VOL. II. G"], [64, "42 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. 1103, with a rental of 5632/, which is high, being more than 5/. to each individual of the population, and showing that the parish is an agricultural one, and one which holds no mean rank in that class. Basing house is celebrated for the determined resistance which its proprietor made to the parliamentary forces in the time of the civil war, which resistance was not overcome till Cromwell himself \u2014 the invincible warrior of the time, personally led and directed the attack. Basing house seems to have been a structure and residence of no small impor tance at a very early period of English history. When the Doomsday book was drawn up, it was the chief of the fifty five lordships in the holding of Hugh De Port, one of the most influential barons in the whole county. After some time the De Ports assumed the surname of St. John ; and after various transitions from name to name, through failure of heirs male, it came into the possession of the Paulet fa mily in the reign of Henry VI. Sir William, the then re presentative of the family, was created Baron St. John of Basing by Henry VIII ; and earl of Wiltshire, and marquis of Winchester, by Edward, the predecessor of Mary. This personage appears to have been a courtier of the highest order, inasmuch as he remained a favourite, through a long course of years, with monarchs of the most opposite descrip tion \u2014 Henry, Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth. This facility of ingratiating himself with sovereigns of so very different dispositions and views, of course enabled him to accumulate no ordinary quantity of the good things of this world, out of the proceeds of which he re-built Basing house in the most fashionable and splendid style of the time. When eighty five years of age, he entertained Queen Elizabeth in splen did fashion, at his mansion here ; and that royal lady, who knew how to flatter, as well as how to be vindictive and cruel, was pleased to declare, that had it not been for his great age, she would have made the lord treasurer, which office the marquis then held, the partner of that royal couch \u2014 to permanent repose upon which no living man was"], [65, "43 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. permitted. Extreme flexibility of character \u2014 a sort of ac commodating to circumstances, surpassing the vicar of Bray, or the notorious earl of Shaftesbury, appears to have been the demonstration of temper, in virtue ' of which this nobleman bent into the safest position to every wind that blew, even when the politics of England were a perfect tornado. The lords of this mansion and manor do not appear to have for gotten the advantage which their shrewd ancestor derived from his easy flexibility to the desires of all sorts of kings and queens ; for his grandson William, entertained the then somewhat antiquated Elizabeth, in the first year of the seventeenth century, with pomp and circumstance, which shewed that there was gratitude owing, nathless the physi cal deterioration of the prime object of lordly attraction. The same gratitude to royalty, though from the circum stance of the times not perchance so much seasoned with the salt of well-being to the useful part of the nation \u2014 for though Elizabeth was cruel to her paramours, she was kind to her kingdom \u2014 the descendant of this nobleman \u2014 if nobility consists in title \u2014 was most zealous in the cause of Charles I. A man who had profited so much through the medium of his gently bending ancestor, by the favour of all sorts of kings and queens, had really no alternative but, right or wrong, to stand by the power which had made his mighti ness. Accordingly, he was one of the most sturdy sup porters of Charles I ; when that sombre and solemn, but somewhat stupid monarch, treading in the footsteps of his father, Jamie, but not clearly understanding the \" reulis and cautilis\" of that pedantic man of peace, had sinned be yond forgiveness against the noblest interests and best rights of the English nation ; and, by most unseemly violation of the law, had brought his royal head under the infliction of its severest punishment, \u2014 when the nursling of the not al together notorious Buckingham had done these things, and the independent people of England resolved to throw off the excrescence recently imported from the more fawning regions of the north \u2014 in the same way as the sloughing of a g2"], [66, "44 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. healthy body throws off the corruption of an ulcer; the then lord of Old Basing house stood sturdily up for Charles and corruption, and stood up with talent and energy worthy of a better cause. The resolute defender of the castle of Old Basing was John, the fifth marquis of Winchester ; and there was, per haps, no parallel to it in the war between Charles and the Parliament, \u2014 although internal wars, or Civil wars, as they are most unaptly called, are more mixed up with personal and party feelings, and therefore waged with more rancour and desperation, than wars between nation and na tion. Basing castle was first assaulted by Sir William Wal ler, the parliamentary commander, in the month of August, 1643 ; but after three attempts to storm it, all made in the course of nine days, Sir William was repulsed by the gar rison, and obliged to retreat to Farnham. A more formi dable party, consisting of almost the whole parliamentary forces in Hants and Sussex, under the command of the brave Colonel Norton of Southwick, near Portsmouth, has tened to renew the siege. The marquis was not intimidated by this new formidable investment, but declared, that though the king should lose every foot of land in England, he would still defend the castle to the last extremity ; and to inspire all his garrison with the same resolution, in case any of them should need it, he wrote with a diamond on every window of the house, the words \" Aimez Loyaulte\" \u2014 Love Loyalty, \u2014 not, love Royalty, showing that he stood out thus gallantly for the king, not upon personal grounds, but from regarding him as the legitimate head of the govern ment and administrator of the law \u2014 that he was a loyalist in principle, not a party royalist. Colonel Norton was also a loyalist, though a loyalist, having different views of the matter : he took the field, and took it bravely, for the privilege of the parliament, which Charles had unquestionably invaded; but he had no hos tility to the king according to law. It happened in that unfortunate contest \u2014 in which England suffered more than"], [67, "45 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. in any other since the war of the Roses \u2014 that some of the most loyal men \u2014 the men most devoted to the whole con stitution in all its three branches, were arrayed upon each side; while mere courtiers mingled with the one party, and enemies to both king and parliament mingled with the other. Upon the side of Charles, the loyal men stood only for the constitutional authority of the king ; while the cour tiers stood for him in disregard of the constitution. The loyalists on the side of parliament stood only for its consti tutional privileges ; the rest of that party being enemies to all government. Between the first sections of the two par ties, it was merely a misunderstanding ; but between the second it was implacable and deadly opposition. The for mer were anxious to save both constitution and country : the latter recked not for the ruin of both. This distinction is an important one, and necessary, before we can do justice to brave and good men upon either side \u2014 to such men as the marquis of Winchester and Colonel Norton \u2014 during this dis tracting, and frequently misrepresented period of our history. Colonel Norton invested Basing house, without assaulting it ; and his object evidently was to procure the surrender, not to effect the destruction, of the castle and army of his compatriot. This is evident from his having cantoned his forces in order to cut off the supplies of the garrison ; and when the garrison made sallies, his troops usually retired after a skirmish. The siege, or rather blockade, was a tedi ous one, and lasted the whole of the summer of 1644; but by the autumn of that year, the plan of Colonel Norton began to take effect, and the garrison were in want of sup plies. The blockade, however, was not so close as to prevent the dispatch of a messenger from the castle ; and accordingly the marquis sent again and again to the king for relief. The strength of the parliamentary garrisons of the interme diate towns, and their having possession of great part of the country, caused these applications to be long unheeded ; but when at length the marquis sent positive information, that, unless relieved, famine would compel him to surren-"], [68, "46 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. der in ten days, it was, resolved to hazard the apparently dreadful attempt. When this was resolved on, Colonel Gage, one of the best and bravest officers of Charles's party, volunteered to conduct the enterprise, and many of his troops, both horse and foot, also volunteered their services, though for relief, not for assault. It was a sort of forlorn hope ; and therefore it called out the best and boldest soldiers of the royal army. Gage conducted them with great skill ; and had it not been for the imprudence of some of those under him, who went out foraging with the badges of their party, he would have come close upon Basing house without its being known to Norton. As it was, he came so near that Norton had no time to concentrate his forces ; and though a part of them made resistance, the onset by Gage was so irresistible that the besiegers were driven from one side of the castle, and Gage, having supplied it with ammunition, marched for Ba singstoke, in quest of provisions ; that town had been a ren dezvous of the parliamentary commissioners of forage, and accordingly Gage got as much as his troops could remove, with which he entered the garrison, and remained for a day or two, sending out his troops for farther supplies : upon learning, however, that the parliamentary forces were col lecting in order to fall upon his rear, and also to meet him in front and dispute his passage over the Kennet, he con trived to mislead them by false dispatches ; and he returned to Oxford with the loss of only ten men killed, and not many wounded. But the relief afforded by this gallant enterprise was only temporary ; for Colonel Norton, who probably pursued the same tactics of not destroying his countrymen if he could avoid it, which he had shown by investing not assaulting Basing house, was still in possession of the country ; and in two months' time, the supply began to be exhausted, and the garrison in the same distress as before ; and when this was known, Colonel Gage again proposed to relieve it. Provisions were now difficult to be obtained near the place, even though a party should reach it ; and there-"], [69, "47 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. fore Gage selected a thousand of the best horsemen, each loaded with as much corn and other provisions as his horse could carry, and this was easily delivered to the garrison ; for Norton had drawn off his troops into winter quarters before the arrival of Gage. How long this blockade without assault might have been carried on, if Colonel Norton had returned to invest Basing house, it is not easy to say. But by this time the better feelings of both parties, had deen merged-in the alloy of the more furious. Oliver Cromwell was in the field, armed with great determination, great military talents, and with the most fanatical enthusiasm, so that he was everywhere, and wherever he came he smote like a thunder-bolt. Scarcely had he arrived, when the fortifications of Basing castle were demolished, the brave garrison dispersed, the mansion plun dered of property to the amount of two hundred thousand pounds, and then burnt and battered to a heap of ruins : \u2014 Such, in brief outline, is the story of the final catastrophe of the castle of Old Basing. Every 100/. of the plunder which Cromwell seized at Old Basing cost the life of an Englishman, 2000 having been killed during the sieges. The final capture of it, too, may be said to have been by surprise ; for the outworks being breached, two regiments of Cromwell's men, under Waller and Montague, mounted the ramparts of the place, and set upon the garrison before it was aware of the inbreak of the enemy ; \u2014 it is probable that the forbearing tactics of Colonel Norton may have thrown the marquis off his guard, and thus made him a far more easy prey to the impetuous onset of Cromwell than he otherwise would have been. He, and his second in command, Sir Robert Peak, with about four hundred of the garrison, were made prisoners, and many of the rest were put to the sword. Though Basing house was the structure most completely ruined at this time, and as such is generally named in the accounts of the transaction, it was not the stronghold, or even a castellated keep, such as is met with in some parts"], [70, "48 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. of the country, in all the old baronial castles. It was a pa lace, and a very splendid palace, in what is called the Eliza bethan style, built by the first marquis \u2014 he who was the suc cessful courtier of so many sovereigns of conflicting politics. The castle, or fort, is of unknown antiquity ; and from its ample size, its commanding situation, and its circular form, it was probably a place of strength before the Roman inva sion. The area, inclosed by the principal fort and intrench ments, was about fourteen acres and a half; the ditches were very deep, and the ramparts high and strong. Within the inclosure was a circular citadel, with a fortified platform on the north, apparently for the accommodation of bowmen, before the invention of musketry, in case of an enemy car rying the body of the place. Originally the walls had pro bably been of mud ; and we believe that no Roman masonry has been met with ; but the more modern gate-ways and walls were of brick, laid in very strong cement. Altogether, Old Basing is a place of much interest, and from the size of the church, and the antiquity of some parts of it, it was, in all probability, a place of great resort before Basingstoke took the lead of it in point of population. The history of the defender of Old Basing and his imme diate successor, is an eventful history, and has so much of apparent romance in it, that a brief sketch may not be alto gether out of place. The marquis received neither honour nor emolument at the Restoration, notwithstanding the brave de fence he had made, and the loss which he had incurred ; he lived in retirement, not in any re-built portion of his former palace, or even in the chateau of Hackwood, which occupied a part of the site of the modern mansion of the same name, about two miles south of the demolished palace and the ruined castle. He ended his days at Englefield, in Berks, and his remains were interred in the parish church there. His demise took place in 1674 ; and his eldest son, Charles, who succeeded to the titles and estates, played Hamlet, during the remainder of the Stuart domination, only his Hamlet was not a tragedy, but a comedy ; and one which"], [71, "49 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. ended well, and shewed that he had assumed his disguise for some purpose. In his mode of life he was a very mad cap, taking no apparent interest in religion, in politics, or in anything serious ; but hunting, hawking, making glee and fun all day, except some hours at noon, which were allotted for sleep, sitting down to dinner at six or seven in the even ing, and never quitting the table, or suffering the wine or the viands to be removed till the same hour in the morning. There is no reason to believe that he was in the least dissi pated, or that he was the cause of dissipation in others, far ther than that he made his guests, who were numerous and warmly attached to him, remain at table the whole night long. They might take a nap, however, or they might drink, or sing, or dance, or make innocent sport of any kind, and he was always foremost in the fun ; but it appears that his madcap hall was virtue itself, compared with the palace of that sovereign whose ingratitude to so loyal a father had made the son put on perhaps the most bizzure deport ment ever assumed by any English nobleman. Yet, under all the froth of this assumed appearance, there ran a stream of the soundest wisdom, and the most honest devotedness to the civil and religious liberties of England, \u2014 a stream which, had the glance of tyranny fallen upon it, would have brought the marquis to the block. But his disguise was complete, and the madcap marquis of Winchester danced, and hunted, and dined away, with the universal character of being a man of no use to anybody. When, however, the tyranny of James had roused the good old spirit of England, which had been drugged to stupor in the reign of the second Charles, the marquis of Winchester cast off his disguise in an instant, was one of the foremost and ablest men in bring ing about the Revolution, was created duke of Bolton by William, and raised a regiment, and fought gallantly for that monarch in Ireland. He died in 1698, and left behind him a most singular, but most estimable and imperishable me mory. This nobleman was assisted in bringing about the Revo- VOL. II. H"], [72, "50 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. lution by his sons ; and the dukes of Bolton were in high favour with the House of Hanover, until the family became extinct in the male line, in 1774, and the estates passed into the hands of Orde Paulet, Baron Bolton, in right of his lady, who was daughter to the fifth duke of Bolton, the last except one'. Lord Bolton modernised the pleasure grounds at Hackwood, or Hawkwood, \u2014 which is one of the finest parks in the county \u2014 or the kingdom. Odiham, the only market-town in the district, save Ba singstoke, once contained a royal residence ; and, it is beau tifully situated, and in a very rich part of the county ; but it does not possess the same local advantages as a thorough fare that Basingstoke possesses \u2014 the roads to it in all directions being hilly ; and therefore, it is more confined to the supply of the neighbourhood, and the transfer of the produce of that to other markets. The town is small, but the parish is large, and much of it consists of very fine land. The parish contained, by the census of 1831, 3310 inhabi tants, and the rental was returned at 8777/. A considera ble number of the inhabitants reside in the village of North Warnborough, which is between the town and the park and castle, and extends nearly a mile along a country road. Odi ham was formerly a free borough belonging to the bishop of Winchester ; but the castle and park belonged to the crown; and the former was a fortalice strong enough for being, in the time of John, defended by fifteen men for fifteen days, against the attacks of the barons. The keep of the castle is still called King John's house ; but only the ruins are left. These stand on a height about a mile north of the town, and near the opposite bank of the Whitewater, which passes a little to the west of Odiham ; but here its quantity of water is not great. Odiham castle was a prison for royalty, as well as a palace ; for, when David, king of Scotland, was taken prisoner at Nevill's Cross, in 1346, he was conducted to the castle of Odiham, and kept prisoner for eleven years, \u2014 at the end of which he was liberated, upon giving hostages, and paying a ransom of one thousand marks.

He travelled to Jerusalem to see the Holy Sepulchre, learned Greek in the Isle of Rhodes, and Latin at Rome; and returning to England, he settled in London as a teacher, was the first master of St. Paul's school, and published the Latin Grammar so long in use. Dog mersfield, about a mile to the east of Odiham, is a mansion belonging to the Mildmay family. The mansion stands in a park of about 700 acres, finely diversified and wooded, and containing a sheet of water of considerable size. At one time the archbishops of Canterbury had a residence here. As this part of the county differs from the southern part in the absence of religious houses or their sites or ruins, but contains several very fine parks and mansions, we shall men tion one or two more of these, before we proceed to enume rate the parish churches and principal villages. Strathfieldsaye claims a forward place among them, on account of its extent and its beauty ; and, when we take its present proprietor into consideration, it claims the foremost place of any mansion of a subject within the realm. It is the residence of Arthur Wellesley, duke of Wellington; and, we believe, is a testimony of the nation's gratitude to him, for more extensive and more valuable services than ever before were rendered to Britain or to Europe by a military man. Of his military fame we speak not, that is on the record of the whole civilised world, now and for ever, and we would not spot its lustre by any eulogy in words. We may, however, remark in passing, that the duke of Wellington, from the beginning of his brilliant career to the end, was never a patronised soldier, who owed his promotion to friends or to purchase ; he won his honours as every honourable man wins distinction, by strenuous exertion, till experience had made him thoroughly master of every department of his pro fession, and every means by which conquest could be insured, at as little sacrifice of his own troops, and as kindly to the conquered, as possible ; and, when he had outdone all his h 2"], [78, "52 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. contemporaries in professional power, he stormed the high places of the army one after one, and won them with honour to himself, and applause from every soldier of whatever rank. The gleam of his glory was first lit up in the hazardous but happy-terminating battle of Assaye, and he brightened and broadened it by victory after victory, until at Waterloo it covered the world. We speak chiefly of him as a man \u2014 of his inflexible intregrity, his perfect justice to every man and every nation with whom he came in contact, of the equani mity with which he bore obloquy that he did not deserve, and of his perfect indifference to flattery, when the civilised world from one end to the other was ringing with his applause. His letters after the great battle was won, were occupied chiefly in expressions of sorrow for the friends he had lost in the action, and words of condolence to their sur viving friends ; and, after the Allied Armies entered Paris, he was steadily, constantly, and energetically employed in acts of preservation and kindness towards the French people. Of his very arduous and straightforward life since the peace we say nothing. Every public man in England must be of a party, and party is inconsistent with the purpose of these pages ; but this much we must say, that, whether in public or in private, the intentions of the the duke of Wellington have always been pure, aud his actions spotless. Strathfieldsaye, the residence of his grace, is situated in the extreme north of the county, about three miles and a half east of Silchester, and stretches about a mile along the mar gin of the larger patch of Wilts, which here lies between Berks and Hampshire. The average breadth of the grounds is also about a mile, and the average length from north to south about a mile and a half. The river Loddon winds through the grounds, dividing them into two unequal parts, and is expanded into various sheets of ornamental water, \u2014 the mansion being in the western or smaller division. On the eastern side, the ground swells into hills ; and though the park is not one of the most extensive in the county, it is very pleasant. The parish church stands at the south-western"], [79, ""], [80, "LIE) PA USK. TEE SEAT OF C J*. LEFEVKE . \u00a3S0* MF aal"], [81, "53 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. corner of the domain ; and the parish contains 808 inhabi tants, and has a valued rental of 4794/. \" Strath,\" or \" Strat,\" as it is usually pronounced and written in England, in all probability a Normanised ortho graphy, always implies that there is a \"stretch\" of level ground with elevations of some height or other along the sides. It is a British word, and very common in Scotland, nor is it unknown in Wales. From its occurring here in Strathfield saye, and also in the adjoining parish of Stratfield Turgis, we would naturally conclude that this part of the valley of the Loddon had been cleared and cultivated in very early times. Stratfield Turgis is a smaller parish than the former, having 1267/. rental, and 232 inhabitants. There are many seats in this neighbourhood which our limits will not permit us to detail. Heckfield/ is only about a mile .to the east of Strathfieldsaye ; and the grounds there are of considerable extent. This parish is more populous than Strathfieldsaye, but it contains more commons, and the rental is not so large. The population is 1202, and the rental 3209/. About two miles south-east of this, and on the opposite side of the White and Black waters, Bramshill park is situated, it is on the left bank of the Blackwater, with an extensive common to the north, and a heath to the south ; and above this there is no seat of any consequence upon the Blackwater ; as the ground here becomes less fertile and inviting. Parish churches are also few and far asunder in this eastern portion of the district ; Eversley and Yateley being the only ones. Both are near the river, though not upon the water-meadows, which are here of considerable breadth. Eversley, though much of the land is poor, is an extensive parish, with a popu lation of 755, and a rental of 3554/. Yateley lies about two miles to the east of Eversley, and is a still larger parish with a soil of poorer quality, and the population much higher in proportion to the rent. The rent is only 2700/., while the population is 1874, which is only about 30s. to each indivi dual. In the direction southward of Yateley, there is not a"], [82, "54 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. single parish church in the district ; nor is there one within an average distance of about six or seven miles from east to west, and about eight miles from north to south. The first one we come to is Crondall, three miles north-west of Farn- ham, and rather more than a mile within the boundary of Hampshire. This is on better land, at the source of one of the branches of the Whitewater, and it is large and popu- lous, with a village of considerable size at the parish church. The rental is 8782/., and the population 2010. About half- a-mile west of Crondall, stands Ewshot house, once the seat of the Giffords, who were for many years sheriffs of the county. The grounds are of small extent; but they were laid out by Capability Brown. Westward of a line drawn from Eversley to Crondall, the land improves greatly, and churches and seats become more numerous. Dogmers field, on the east side of the park already alluded to, is a good deal occupied by commons ; but the rent bears a high ratio to the inhabitants, which is one evidence that the land under culture is good. There are only 272 people, and a rental of 1696/., which is more than 61. to each individual, or four times as much as in the parish of Yateley. Winch field, immediately to the north of Dogmersfield park, is the next parish, with a population of 237, and a rental of 1552/., which shows that it is a parish of nearly the same cha- racter. Hartley Whitney, about a mile and a half north of Winchfield, brings us to Heckfield. It is an extensive parish, and contains a considerable number of inhabitants ; but the soil is not so rich, nor the rental so high in propor- tion to the people, as in either of the two last-named pa- rishes. The population is 1139, and the rental 3868/. The road from Odiham to the great London road at Hartley Row, passes through these three parishes. It is hilly ; but the scenery is beautiful. At Hartley Wintney, a Cistercian nun- nery was founded soon after the conquest, for a prioress and seventeen sisters, and it continued till the dissolution by Henry VIII. About a mile east of the church is the house and grounds of Eveltham, which was a seat of the earl of"], [83, "I K 0 IS & E . \u25a0 . \u25a0 \u2022 P.Mi, hlmrf !!,.,/. >'*-. . /"], [84, ""], [85, ""], [86, "V/ u O n [j 'a . j '' LORD BOLTQi"], [87, "55 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. Hertford, and rendered conspicuous, about the close of the sixteenth century, for a three days' entertainment of Elizabeth upon one of her progresses ; but it has now passed into other hands, and the mansion has been much curtailed in its dimensions. We shall now turn our attention to the downs westward of Odiham, and notice the parishes and places which are situated there, from the valley of the Itchen as described in the first volume, and the valley of the Wey to be described in the next chapter, to the vicinity of Hackwood park, and to where the Whitewater becomes a definite stream. The natural boundary is quite indefinite here; but we shall take it from Crondall, along the heights to Windmill hill on the London road, and thence by Farleigh wood in the direction of Winklebury hill, as these are points to which we have already referred. Adopting this line of boundary, the first parish church and village is Long Sutton, two miles south of Odiham, and one to the east of the road between Odiham and Alton, This parish has 326 inhabitants, the greater part of whom are collected into the village near the church ; and the rental of the parish is 2430/. It lies near the summit of the downs, and is in some places bare of timber, but some parts of it are good land. A mile to the west, and on the road, the church and village of South Warnborough are situated. This parish is the same in extent, population, and character as Sutton, the rental being 2839/., and the population 374. The sub-stratum in this part of the county is chalk ; but it is, in most places, covered by a portion of the tertiary forma tion, varying in substance from loose gravel to strong clay, and in thickness from a few inches to several feet. Shalden is situated on the line joining South Warnborough and Windmill hill, about three miles and a half distant from the former, and four miles from the latter. The country here is bleak, and the inhabitants few. There are only 167 in the parish, and the valued rental is 1133/. The people are mostly resident in the village ; and the open fields have a"], [88, "56 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. naked appearance ; but the surface is varied by copses and woods, spotted about in all directions. Bentworth is about two miles and a quarter south-west of Shalden; and it is much more wealthy and populous \u2014 the rental being 3392/., and the population nearly 600. Lasham lies a mile and a half west-and-by-north of Bentworth, and more on the cen tre of the high grounds. It contains 236 inhabitants, and the rental is 1128/. The road from Basingstoke to Alton passes through the village. Meadsted, about a mile and three quarters north-and-by-west of Windmill hill, occupies the extreme south-west of the natural division. It has a population of 418, and the rental is 2402/. By comparing the rental and population of these parishes, it will be seen that they are all of the same character, the proportion of rent to an inhabitant, being about 5/., which is an average popu lation for an agricultural district. Proceeding northward in the direction of Winklebury, we come to the church and village of Weald, which is a parish of the same character, but on the western inclination of the county ; and about two miles to the north-east is Bradley, with a population of 103, and a rental of 756/. This parish consists, in great part, of downs ; and it may be considered as lying on the western slope, as it is not two miles east of Preston Candover on the north branch of the Itchen. But as there are no running waters here for several miles, there are no means of determining the summit-levels without actual measurement, the labour of which would be immense, and of no adequate utility, as no great line of communication requires to be laid down over these heights. Ellisfield, Farleigh, and Cliddesden, are the remaining parishes on the western part of the heights, and bring us nearly to Basing stoke, Cliddesden being only a mile to the west of Hackwood park. Ellisfield lies about two miles and a half north-and by-east of Bradley ; and there is much woodland in the line between them, and also in the neighbouring parish of Far leigh, the church of which lies about a mile and a half to the north-west, and the village is half a mile to the south-east of"], [89, "57 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. the church and near to Farleigh wood. Ellisfield has a population of 245, and a rental of 1804/. The population of Farleigh is 108, and the rental 1232/. Cliddesden is more rich and populous, the rental being 2106/, and the population 329. The village of Cliddesden is of conside rable extent ; but the neighbourhood is very bare from want of timber, \u2014 forming a striking contrast to Farleigh parish. We shall next enumerate the parishes on the central part of the heights between Cliddesden and South Warnborough. These are only about six miles and a half apart ; there is not a stream of water in the whole range, and only one residence of any note, and yet there are five parish churches, Winslade, Tunworth, and Upton Grey, on the direct line ; and Herriard and Weston Patrick, farther to the south. Winslade lies a little south of Hackwood. It contains 134 people, and the rental is 1277/. Generally, it is bare of timber; which also is the character ofthe two parishes to the east. The population of Tunworth is 126, and the rental is 816/. : those of Upton Grey are 425, and 1215/. \u2014 a smaller rental as compared with the number of people. Herriard is about a mile and a half south of Winslade ; it contains 426 people, and the rental is 1315/. On the north, there are woods of some extent ; and to the eastward of the church is Herriard park, the only mansion and demesne of any consequence on the downs. Weston Patrick lies about a mile to the south of Upton Grey, \u2014 population 210, rent 836/. The grounds about the village are high and bleak, but there are woods and copses at some distance to the south. Mapledurwell, about three miles east of Basing stoke, in the direct line to Odiham, is the last parish on the high and bleak downs. It stands on the brow of the northern slope, within about half-a-mile of the Basing stoke canal. It has a rental of 816/. and contains 211 in habitants. There are some barrows on the slope of the down, which show that there has been a battle here at some remote period. A small branch of the Loddon rises near this place. VOL. II. I"], [90, "58 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. Grewell is the only parish in the valley of the White water ; and it is in the upper part within about a mile of Odiham. The church is pleasantly situated on the left bank of the stream ; and the parish contains 217 inhabi tants, with a rental of 968/. Immediately to the north of Grewell are the park and site of the castle of Odiham ; and to the north and west of them, the woodlands of Hack com mon and Butler wood, \u2014 the former extending northward to the railway. Below this parish, there is no parish church, or village of any consequence, in the valley of the Whitewater, until it reaches Heckfield, already noticed, about a mile and a half from the boundary of the county. In the valley of that branch of the Loddon which rises at Mapledurwell, there are the three parishes of Skewers, Newnham, and Rotherwick, all on the right bank ; and far ther down, on the same bank of the Loddon, after the branch joins it, is the parish of Hartley Wespall, which brings us down to Stratfield Turgis ; and these complete all the pa rishes eastward of the main stream of the Loddon. Skew ers lies directly east of Old Basing, two miles distant from it, within three furlongs of the river, and a very little to the south of the great London road. It is not a large parish, but the soil is rich. Newnham is not a mile north of Skew ers, and only half-a-mile from the river. It contains 329 inhabitants, and the rental is 1431/. Rotherwick is rather more than a mile north of Newnham. It is a more exten sive and valuable parish than either of the former, with 436 inhabitants, and a rental of 2109/. To the eastward of the village there are considerable patches of wood ; and imme diately to the south of the western part, are the house and grounds of Tilney hall, the only considerable park and man sion in the neighbourhood. Hartley Wespall is a mile and a half north-westward of Rotherwick, and a mile and a quarter south of Stratfield Turgis. It contains 283 inha bitants, and the rental is 1774/. From Basingstoke to opposite Hartley, there are water meadows on the Loddon, and also on the eastern branch,"], [91, "59 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. from near Skewers to the junction. But, immediately west from Hartley, the heights come close to the stream, which appears to have worked itself a passage here, and emptied a lake, or at all events, drained a marsh, on the upper part of the river and its branch. This will account for the ab sence of churches and other ancient buildings near the banks in these parts ; and the same hypothesis explains similar cir cumstances in other parts of the county. The churches were of course erected where the ground was best, at the time of their erection ; and so, when we find them on the banks of streams, we may conclude that these banks were very early in a state fit for cultivation ; whereas, we may draw the op posite conclusion, where the churches are at a distance from the water. The same remark applies to residences, that is, to ancient ones, though it does not apply to the same extent; inasmuch as the old residences, which were of sufficient importance to leave remains, were always places of strength ; and therefore, though a steep height was essential to the early mode of strengthening a post, yet it was always desi rable to have a supply of water at hand to fill the ditch. On that part of the river where the Strathfields are situated, there has been no marshy bottom, no lake to empty ; the bank slopes gradually, and this is the reason why the churches there are near the river, and have the word \" strath\" applied to them. We may also remark, that the name Hart ley, which occurs so often in this part of Hampshire, throws a little more light upon the early state of the country. Hartley literally means \" the pasture of harts,\" or males of deer ; and we infer that these \"Hart-leys\" were certain open places to which the animals came to graze when they left the close forests. The only portion of this natural division of Hampshire, which remains to be noticed, is that which lies between the right bank of the Loddon, from Old Basing northward, and a line drawn from Rooksdown to Silchester, This portion is nearly bisected by a nameless branch of the Loddon, which rises in the downs about a mile west of Monks' i 2"], [92, "60 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. Sherborne, and after a course of six or seven miles east ward, falls into the Loddon about a mile and a half above Stratfield Turgis. The bank on the north of this stream, though not high, rises abruptly, and the whole surface is formed of gentle swells and hollows ; there is no considera ble village in it, neither is there any parish church, with the exception of Strathfieldsaye already noticed, save the church of Bramley, which stands about half-a-mile from the nameless brook and two miles from the Loddon. This is an extensive and rather a valuable parish, \u2014 the population, which is scattered through a number of small villages, being 419, and the rental 2794/. On the south side of the brook there are three parishes, Chinham, about a mile and a half north-and-by-east of Basingstoke ; Sherborne St. John, about two miles north-west of Chinham ; and Sherfield, about two miles and a half north-east of the same ; the two parishes first named are in the first hollow under the chalk ridge, and a swelling ground of the tertiary formation divides them from Sherfield. There are only 41 inhabitants in the tithing of Chinham. Sherborne St. John is a populous and wealthy parish ; the inhabitants are 702, and the rental 3460/. About a mile to the north-east of Sherborne St. John, there is situated the Vine, a place of some note in history. It was formerly the seat of the Sandys family, who made a considerable figure, both in the local history of Hampshire, and in the general history of England. It is also stated that this place derived its name from vines introduced from Italy by Probus, and cultivated here. This is by no means unlikely, for the Romans and Romanised Britons, and also the monks during the middle ages, had vineyards and made wine in various parts of the south of England. Nor is there much reason to doubt that, in favourable situations, and with proper skill and care, the same culture might still be carried on ; though whether it could be done profitably is quite another matter. In many parts of Russian Poland, where the winter is far more severe than in any part of Britain, and the summer shorter though hotter, the peo-"], [93, "61 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. pie grow vines, and make wine of the grapes. No doubt it it; \" small acid tiff,\" but the flavour of the grape is in it ; and most of the other qualities can be artificially imparted. Sherfield, the only parish remaining to be noticed, slopes principally toward the north and eastward to the Loddon. The church is about a mile from the principal stream and the village is small, but the population of the whole parish is considerable, being about 599, and the rental is 3111/. Such are the general outlines, and such, in brief, the principal details of that natural district or division of Hamp shire which slopes to the north-east, and extends from the highest part of the central chalk ridge to a considerable way into the secondary strata. It has no general history like some of the western districts, which were petty king doms of themselves in very early times ; for, though Sil chester is generally said to have been the stronghold of a sept or clan of the Britons, yet it is probable that their ter ritory extended only a little way into this district. Still, however, it is not without its interest, both on account of past transactions of which it has been the scene, and of its present state, and the improvements of which it is suscepti ble in future, as well as of the lines of communication which pass through it. Taken upon the whole, it is probably the most varied portion of Hampshire, in its surface, its soil, and its climate. The south-west part of it is a sort of table land upon the chalk heights ; eastward of this, there are hills and dells, with such wavy irregularities of the chalk and furrows of that substance, filled up with gravel, sand, and other tertiary matters, as would lead one to conclude, that the sea-flood which brought the tertiary formation, had been a long time in action ; and that the chalk had been thus pitted and furrowed by it, before the deposits were brought to their present localities. The crag-sand, which we meet with in the extreme end of the district, is proba bly the result of a later action of the waters than the gravel and the clay, but still it is the result of a marine action, and not a fresh-water one ; \u2014 the crag could not have been de-"], [94, "62 THE NORTH-EASTERN SLOPE. posited by any of the land-floods, which were occasioned by the bursting of lakes in the early history, as there are no beds of these of sufficient magnitude for having contained the requisite supply of water. The atmospheric action upon this natural division of the county is as well worthy of study as the peculiar action of the water by which the strata have been placed in their present order. It is one of the localities where all the winds of heaven may be said to meet ; and thus it is one in which the air can never stag nate or become unhealthy ; but, though the details might be curious, they are too numerous as well as too minute for general notice."], [95, "63 THE EASTERN SLOPE.

That portion of Hampshire of which the eastern slope is the most descriptive general name, is well defined by na ture, both in its boundaries, and in some of its leading phy sical characters. Its eastern boundary, indeed, being nearly that of the county \u2014 the line where Hampshire ends and Sur rey or Sussex begins, depends on no natural feature of the surface, or quality of the soil. It is purely arbitrary, and must be pointed out, in order to be known ; and the best way of obtaining a knowledge of it is to study the map. The map given in this work, which has been carefully re duced with the best instruments, by a practiced geographer, from the Ordnance Survey, may be depended upon for general purposes ; and those who have occasion to go into minute details, should consult that Survey itself \u2014 it being the only original document which can be implicitly relied on, for the shape and boundaries of any one county or district in England. The eastern slope, of Hants, occupies the middle part of the east side of the county, from the hills north-west of Farnham, to the chalk ridge south of Petersfield; and though, like most parts of the county, the surface of it is very irregular, the general slope of it is due east, or away from all the rest of the county."], [96, "64 the eastern slope. Its western boundary is an arc, approaching nearly to a semicircle in the general curve, but waving and irregular in the minute parts. The extremities of the curve are : \u2014 on the north, a point in the hills to the north of the Wey, say Farnham beacon, two miles north-and-by-west of the town of Farnham ; and on the south, the point where the boundary of the county crosses the chalk ridge, say, about two miles and a half north-and-by-east of the borough of Petersfield. The chord of the arc, or straight line from the one of these two points to the other, is about twenty miles in length ; but the actual boundary, being very irregular, is much longer \u2014 something between thirty and forty miles. The flexures and angles are so many that it would be im possible to describe them in words ; but we may state ge nerally, that this artificial boundary extends nearly as far to the east of the straight line joining the extreme points, as the natural boundary along the water-shed of the hills trends to the west. Windmill hill, on the road between Alton and Alresford, so often alluded to, may be taken as the most westerly point ; and the boundary of the county upon Hind head common, about two miles and a half north-east of Bramshot, is the most easterly. The distance of these points is about thirteen miles. The curve along the northern heights from Farnham beacon to Windmill hill, is about thirteen miles. Its position, as we remarked when treating of the north-eastern slope \u2014 of which it forms the south boun dary, is very indefinite ; but it does not differ greatly from a straight line. From Windmill hill southward and eastward, the boundary on the water-shed is more definite, as the hills are more continuous in their masses, and more bold in their escarpments. There is, indeed, a considerable portion of the great downs, which traverse England from Kent to Wilts, with only a few openings for the passages of rivers, \u2014 there is a considerable part of them, where it is not easy to deter mine the water-shed ; but, as Var down is conspicuous for its elevation, it may be taken on the spot where the val ley of the Itchen, and the eastern and southern slopes of"], [97, "65 THE EASTERN SLOPE. the county meet. Var down is about fourteen miles due east of Winchester, five miles north-and-by-west of Peters field, and three south-south-east of Windmill hill. It will be convenient, however, and perhaps in better keeping with the actual level of the country, to take the boundary a little to the west of Var down, so as to include East Tisted, and Privet ; and then it will pass across Tisted common, not far from the road from Alton to Wamford ; and so, along the heights, by Barrow hill eastward of East Meon, by Butser hill, and Buriton down, to the termination at the boundary of the county. Along this line the distances may be rudely estimated at about thirteen miles ; so that the whole boun dary along the water-shed is about twenty-six miles. About one half of the surface within the boundaries now described is on the chalk hills ; and the other \u2014 the lower or eastern half, is chiefly on the green sand. Thus, it agrees with the north-eastern slope, in being composed of two dis tinct and very different formations, or soils, and in the sub stratum of the heights being chalk ; but the formation in the low grounds is very different, both in its character, and in its geological position, and this gives a great difference to the quality of the agricultural mould which results from the mixture of the two ; which mixed soil is the best agricul tural land in both districts. The north-eastern slope has the tertiary formation \u2014 as London clay, as gravel, or as crag, occupying the low part of the district altogether, and overlaying or capping the chalk, over a very considerable portion of the heights. This eastern slope, has the green sand on the low grounds ; which is a formation under the chalk \u2014 an earlier formation,\u2014 and therefore never found superposed upon any part of the chalk, either in the hollows, or capping the hills. Accordingly, all the three soils that occur in the district, are different, in their natural aspect and productions, and also in their eco nomical uses, from the corresponding soils in the north east. The chalk, from having no gravel over it, except toward VOL. II. K"], [98, "66 THE EASTERN SLOPE. the southern slope of the county, where we again have the tertiaiy formation, is bleak and bare \u2014 too poor for profitable cultivation, at least on the lofty summits, the grass upon which, though sweet and kindly what there is of it, is in small quantity, very short, and unfit for the pasture of any animals but sheep. The chalk is, no doubt, one of the ele- ments of a good soil ; and if the soil were ameliorated, there is scarcely a spot on these downs where there is the slight- est objection to the climate. Even decayed vegetable mat- ter would do, and do well ; but the short grass would be a very long time accumulating a quantity sit for agricultural purposes ; and broused as it is, the quantity does not accu- mulate at all. The winds and rains, of autumn and winter, sweep away all the crop of the year which is left by the sheep, and so affect the soil itself, that after a severe and protracted winter, the mere roots of grass that are left barely tinge the high downs with green. This refuse of the scanty vegetation, together with the loosened particles of the chalk, are carried into the hollows, and make a better soil there ; but this is improving the hollow at the expense of the height. The winds from the channel being, in this part of England, the most frequent, the most loaded with rain, and, gene- rally speaking, the most violent, the south-western slopes of the downs are, other circumstances being the same, the most scourged by the weather, and the northern sides, and the slopes under them, are the most rich and green. But, other circumstances are not always the same ; for, when we come to the southern slope of the downs, where the tertiary formation overlays the chalk, the finer parti cles of that are carried to the lower slopes by the very same wind that sweeps the hills with so much severity. Green sand, which occupies the other extremity of the district, is very different in its appearance and vegetation. Those readers who are not conversant with the nomencla ture of geology, must not be misled by the epithet green, which is applied to this formation. The natural colour of the earth of which this sand is composed, is white ; and it"], [99, "67 THE EASTERN SLOPE. owes its colour to some of the salts of iron, \u2014 the colour varying with the kind of salt, and its quantity. Sometimes there is very little iron; and sometimes there is so much that the sand is formed into lumps, which have all the ap pearance of ores of iron, and are exceedingly hard ; but such ores of iron are of no use, as they would run into slag in the furnace. Not only the sand, but the chalk, where it is nearest to the sand, becomes consolidated into pieces hard enough for building and paving ; and such is the case in this part of Hampshire, where the lower part of the chalk crops out upon the sand. In this stony portion, the line of distinc tion between the two is often obliterated, so that one can hardly say where the one begins and the other ends. There is, as it were, a gradual transition from pure lime in the chalk, to pure silica in the sand. These are found in vari ous states of consistency in the earth; and the decomposi tion of them by the atmosphere has, to a great extent, blended them with each other in the soil upon the surface ; so that between the pure chalk of the high downs, and the sand in its pure state, there are very many characters of soil, each of them best adapted for a different kind of crop. Woolmer forest, which occupies the extreme east of this division, is as good a specimen of the green sand in a state of nature, as the uncultivated parts of the high downs are of the chalk in the same. This is a royal forest, but it is now without game, and has for ages been without trees, except such as have been planted of late. It occupies a considera- ble extent of surface, being about six miles in length, and two in breadth ; and producing no surface crop, save heath, fern, and their usual accompaniments. Soil of this kind is very apt to form a surface impenetrable to water ; and then, soil accumulates, trees grow and run their course. When that course is at an end, they die and fall to the ground ; then come the fungi and the mosses to bury them ; after which the place where they grew is converted into a pool, if there be no outlet for the water. There are such hollows in this forest ; k 2"], [100, "68 THE EASTERN SLOPE. and White, the historian of Selborne, tells us that, in former times, oaks which were as black as ebony, were dug up by the peat-cutters. This forest might be cultivated, \u2014 it cer tainly should be planted. This pure state of the green sand does not form the soil of the whole extent, from the chalk ridge on the south to that on the north ; but is interrupted both ways, by soils of very different nature, of which we shall speak by and by. Low as the sandy portion of this district lies, the summits level of England, between the valley of the Thames and the Channel, passes over it ; so that the one half of this eastern slope of Hampshire leans to the one of these, and the other half to the other. This is pointed out by the two rivers, the Wey and the Arun, both of which have their sources in this district. The Wey, after flowing along the south side of the northern chalk ridge, breaks through that ridge by the opening at Guildford, and then makes its way to the Thames. The Arun flows by the north side of the ridge of the South downs, passes through an opening at Amberley, and falls into the Channel at Little Hampton. The principal valley of the Wey traverses the whole breadth of the district, from Windmill hill to near Farnham ; and this valley, though beautiful, is everywhere narrow. The sources of the prin cipal stream of the Arun, are immediately under Var down ; and thence the course is southward to a point about a mile to the east of Petersfield, where it takes an easterly direc tion, and is very soon out of the county. The length of each river within the county is about nine or ten miles. A spur of the chalky downs, extends eastward by the south side of the Wey, advancing much farther to the east ward than any other part of them, and coming in between that river and the green sand formation. Another spur, lying on the left of the upper or original stream of the Arun, divides that from some of the southern branches of the Wey, and terminates abruptly in some hills to the south oT the village of Selborne. Among these, Nore hill is one of the"], [101, "69 THE EASTERN SLOPE. most conspicuous for the boldness of its escarpment, and the beauty of the wood with which it is, in great part, clothed. Another spur advances on the right bank, between the main stream and some branches of the Arun. When we speak of these remote branches of rivers in the chalky grounds, we must be understood as speaking of mere brooks, such as would not be noticed in a land of rivers properly so called. Thus, for instance, the Arun has not a course of more than a mile and a half, when it quits the chalk hills altogether, about a mile south-east of the village of Empshot. After this it pursues a southerly course, receiving the various brooks from the hills, and one or two from the Woolmer forest side. At Stoner hill, about two miles north-west of Petersfield, and the same distance west of the Arun, the chalk hills assume a bolder appearance than they do in the northern parts. They are also more continuous, curving round by the west and south, and so passing into the long ridge in Sussex, \u2014 in which there is no break until one comes to that through which the Arun passes. To the south, the west, and the north-west of Petersfield, they form a sort of amphitheatre, not in one dull line, but in a succession of elevations of various shapes, with beautiful ravines and dells between, and finely clothed with wood. Butser hill, on the west side of the Portsmouth road, is the most elevated ; and altogether the outlines are bolder there ; but those to the west are more beautiful. Streams of water descend the ravines, and give additional interest ; and they are of ser vice in turning mills. Altogether, these hills about Peters field make finer hill-scenery than is to be met with in any other part of the county ; and they are set off by the plain of Petersfield, which is one of the most extensive portions of level ground in Hampshire. The plain from the hills, and the hills from the plain, both make fine views ; and it depends much upon taste which one shall be preferred. From the hills, especially Butser hill, the view is very ex tensive, taking in the arable land, the brown heath of the forest, the trees on the wealden-bed formation in Sussex, and"], [102, "70 THE EASTERN SLOPE. the extensive commons in Surrey, as far as the high chalk ridge on the downs of Guildford. The wealden-bed formation, to which we have alluded as forming part of the land seen from one or other of the heights about Petersfield, does not come within Hampshire, but it approaches very near to the boundary, and may have had some effect upon the soil of this district. It lies below both the green sand and the chalk, both of which must have been formed in the sea ; inasmuch as they contain the shells of many marine animals, but not a vestige of any one shell or other animal remain at all analagous to those that are to be found on land, or in the fresh waters. But the shells which are met with in the wealden-beds, are all land or fresh- water shells ; and there are also the remains of reptiles, which cer- tainly inhabited the fresh water, and most likely the land itself. Now these must be the remains of some former and very ancient world, which world must have been at least three times submerged to a great depth under the sea ; for, besides the sand and chalk there is the tertiary formation over it ; and this must also have been formed many hundred feet below the surface of the water. In some places it is now nearly 800 feet above the mean level of the sea ; and, of course, it must once have been at least as much below that level. Considering these matters, and considering also that the earth has been pretty nearly in its present condition for some thousands of years, during which the surfaces of all the strata have been exposed to the decomposing action of the sun, and the atmosphere, and all their surfaces swept over by the same wind, \u2014 considering these things, we must come to the conclusion that, in the hollows where shelter, and vege tation, and damp, all tend to arrest the driving dust, there must be portions of all these soils blended together. This blending is modified by many circumstances, which, taken together, help to explain why there are so many gra dations in the land of this district, whether we take it from chalk to chalk, in the direction of north and south, or from"], [103, "71 THE EASTERN SLOPE. sand to chalk, in that of east and west. As the chalk over lays, or crops out upon, the sand, and as there is a general blending of them at the junction, it follows that, in propor tion as the slope from one to the other is longer in rela tion to the height, more of the mixed soil from the decom position must be exposed. Hence the sand is always found nearer the bold chalk hills than to those which slope gradu ally. In the neighbourhood of Petersfield the sand is nearer to the high downs than it is about Alton and Selborne. The trees are good indices to the changes of soil in such a country as this; for they cease to grow naturally, and are stunted when planted by art, at both the extremes. About the middle of the series, where the admixture forms a sort of calcareous clay, with the lime still predominating, though the colour varies with the proportion of iron, trees grow with most vigour ; and oak is the prevailing species. The subsoil in these places is always the lower or indurated beds of the chalk, with a considerable portion of sand in minute divisions. The subsoil here, and the soil itself \u2014 in so far as it is not vegetable or animal, is, as it were, stones and mortar, while the chalk on the downs is mortar without stone, and the sand in the forest stone without mortar. This is the proper land for the hop-plant, though it is too strong for ordinary field culture. Below this, but how far below depends on the slope and the quantity of matter washed down from the heights, the soil becomes too hungry for grain; but it will still bear turnips and a few other plants, if strengthened by manure. Such are some of the characters of the soil on the eastern slope of Hampshire ; and we have dwelt the more at length upon them, from the fact that this must always remain an agricultural district. Of the atmospheric action we shall not say much. The south-west is the prevailing wind, and it drops the burden of matters which it drives from the heights upon the eastern slopes. Hence they are more richly wooded by nature, as well as more abrupt, than those which face the south-west. This brings a thick coating of soil, in very minute particles,"], [104, "72 THE EASTERN SLOPE. upon these slopes ; and if they are steep and loaded with timber to the top, so that the wind takes powerful hold, and opens the surface by shaking the trees, the rain finds entrance but no exit ; and the portion next the indurated chalk being reduced to a pulpy consistency, the whole is apt to slide, and produce miniature land-slips, just as sometimes takes place in certain kinds of the London clay, when these are thrown up against a harder substance, or have not base enough. From the green sand being a better conductor of heat than the tertiary formation, and its surface being more exclusively darkened by heath than even the sandy parts of that, also, from the downs of pure chalk being nearer to the low ground than at the north-east of the county, the natural action of the atmosphere, as between hill and plain, is greater. The more the atmosphere is subject to those gentle motions of transfer, which hardly amount to sensible winds, the more susceptible it is to all kinds of action ; and consequently, the more favourable it is to the growth of all useful vegetables. No doubt this predisposes it to rain ; but the rains are not so heavy when they do fall, or at all events they are not of such long continuance. This again is favourable to vegetation ; for when vegetables are hardened by much drought, or soft ened by much rain, in the season of their most rapid growth, their action is never of the most healthy description. The same circumstances render the waters cold, and produce a tendency to snow ; but we have already shown that this is favourable rather than otherwise ; and the very same causes which tend to produce snow in this district, when the sun declines to the southern tropic, tend to remove them early, when he is on his return. As much of the soil consists of decomposed chalk with sand or clay in it, or \" white malm,\" as it is locally termed, the fields and paths are apt to become very sloppy ; but the ground is so uneven that water never settles among the roots of the crop in such quantity as to injure them ; and the lands which are flat enough for the water stagnating, have generally sand enough below to form a drainage."], [105, "73 THE EASTERN SLOPE. Good lines of communication are the greatest deside rata in the district. There are two great thoroughfares from London to the south coast, \u2014 the one by Alton, and the other by Petersfield, near the south-east. The distance by both of them is long, however, and they are of difficult ac cess, especially in winter, the season when good roads are of most value in an agricultural district. From the charac ter of the ground to the north, the west, and the south, no canal or railway can be led through this part of Hampshire, or brought so near to it as to be of any particular value. The cross-roads too, are bad ; and they cannot be made good. In the elevated parts, they are hilly ; and the hills cannot be avoided ; neither can they be cut down to any thing like a level. They cut fast enough, indeed ; for the decomposable nature of the rock, which conduces not a little to the peculiar kind of fertility which the land possesses, makes the roads wear away, not into ruts, but en masse ; and every shower of rain washes off the detritus ; so that, in many places, they resemble deep drains rather than roads ; and in heavy falls of snow, they are sealed up. In the low grounds again, the roads are intolerable with mire ; and that mire, whether it consist more of calcareous clay, or of sand, is of such a nature that flints, or any other \" metal,\" could not be kept on the surface, without a bottom of flag-stones, and that is an expence which cross-roads could not bear. There are no extensive demesnes, or stately mansions, in the district ; second rate houses are not many, and there are very few ruins or remains of any kind. There has been fight ing in the early times ; for there are many barrows on Peters field heath, and some in other places ; but this tells no tale, save the old and universal tale, that mankind have, from the remotest antiquity, been prone to butcher each other by wholesale, and call it glory. As the line of the road from Alton to the valley of tbe Itchen, is a natural pass in the downs, it must have been used for the route of armies, and for other communications, from the earliest period at which the people of the east and the west had intercourse with each VOL. II. L"], [106, "74 THE EASTERN SLOPE. other ; but still it was a place of transit only, and not one of permanent residence. Of market-towns there are only two, \u2014 Alton and Peters field ; and they owe much of their importance to their favour able situations on the two great thoroughfares, which give them the trade of the road, in supplement to the local trade of their several districts, and the local market for the sale of the produce of these. Alton is by much the larger and more populous town of the two, though Petersfield is a parliamentary borough, and Alton is not ; but the parliamentary district of Petersfield is so ample, that it has more the air of a little county, than of the mere liberty of a borough. Alton is beautifully situated, in a rich and a very pleasant part of the county, \u2014 highly fertile, moderately wooded, and enlivened and refreshed by a fine stream of water, which crosses the town under the houses and streets, and conduces not a little to the fa cilities of cleanliness. The town is neat and clean ; and it would be difficult to prevent the latter, as the princi pal streets have so much slope that eveiy shower of rain washes them. The High-street is, of course, that along which the London road passes ; and the length of it con sidered as the town itself, may be about three-quarters of a mile ; but there are straggling houses along the sides of the road for some distance farther, especially at the London end of the town, where they continue at intervals to the village of Hollybourne, which is about a mile and a half east from the centre of Alton. The street which occupies part of the road to Odiham is but short, as the bank there soon gets very steep. The church is situated on the left-hand in leaving the town this way, and it occupies a very com manding site, and forms a conspicuous object, when viewed from the brow of the hill, to the south of the town. The most densely inhabited part is that west of the hill, which crosses the road opposite the church. There are many cross streets, or rather lanes, on each side of the road-line ; and the public market stands at some distance from the"], [107, "alt\u00ae n FROM WINi'MIU.

The principal malting houses and breweries are on the opposite or south side of the road ; and they now carry on what may be considered as the staple trade of the town, \u2014 both the malt and the ale of Alton be ing in request. There are excellent hops in the neighbour hood ; and the barley from the high ground furnishes malt of superior flavour and quality, \u2014 far better than the more rank-growing and larger-grained, but softer barley, which is grown upon the clays and other low-lying and rich soils. The hop-gardens about Alton, are all upon the Alton side of the northern slope ; for, when the high grounds are ar- rived at, the casing of tertiary gravel and clay upon the hills, renders the ground unfit for the cultivation of the hop. On the south side, they extend over a wider range, being grown on favourable spots, as far to the. south as the village of Selborne ; but much further to the south, the soil is not adapted for them. Farnham has the name for hops, but the growth of this part of Hants is little inferior in quality. In backward seasons, they sometimes do not come to maturity ; but they are not so liable to suffer from the east winds or the aphis, as hops are in Kent. Alton once had manufac- tures of some of the lighter woollen fabrics ; but these have gone the way of all the woollen manufactures of Hampshire ; and occupations, more in accordance with the physical cha- racter and more useful productions of the surrounding dis- trict, have come in their stead. The best proof that Al- ton has not suffered by the loss of these manufactures, is obtained from a comparison of the population in 1831 with that in 1801. The population for 1801, was 2026 ; and that for 1831 was 2743, which is an increase of 33| per cent. on the first of these numbers. From the richness of the surrounding district, Alton has a good local trade ; and the market, which is held on Saturday, is well attended. The town is one ofthe polling places for the Northern Division of the county. A number of the Society of Friends are resident in Alton, and have been for a long period of time. No his torical affairs of any great moment are connected with Al- l 2"], [112, "76 THE EASTERN SLOPE. ton ; but some of its natives have attained considerable emi nence in literature and science. Petersfield has the same advantage of being on a great thoroughfare which Alton possesses ; but the situation in which it stands is very different. The ground for some dis tance on all sides of Petersfield, and for a long way to the east, is much better adapted for pasturage than for tillage. From the flatness of the surface, and the nature of the soil, which is sand, with a slight admixture of chalk from the downs, and of clay apparently from the wealden-bed, the vale, or rather plain, immediately around Petersfield, yields grass better adapted for the pasture of cattle than any other part of Hampshire. In most places, the grass on the downs is too short for affording adequate nourishment, while that on the irrigated meadows is rather too rank. The Peters field grass is a medium ; and thus the dairies there have the character of being the best in the county for the quality of their produce. The fields, just under the downs, have a considerable portion of chalk, or thin soil, and grow better corn than the flat ; but, in an agricultural point of view, this part of the county cannot be considered as rich. The brooks from the downs to the west, unite, and form a small river, which flows past the south part of the town ; but the appearance of its water is different from that of the streams in the chalk districts, properly so called. Petersfield was chartered as a corporate and parliamen tary borough in the reign of Elizabeth, and it continued to return two members till the passing of the bill for alter ing the right of election, at which time its representation was reduced to one member, and its parliamentary boun daries extended, so as to include a tract of country about eight miles in its greatest length from north to south, and about six miles in its greatest breadth from east to west. In the one direction it extends from Lyss Turney, on the north to near Clanfield on the south side of the high downs southward; and in the other, from the boundary of the county on the east, to within about a mile of the"], [113, ""], [114, "ENVIRONS OF PETERSF1EIJ). rayed far \"MCTaE'S IUSTOKY or HaMPSHIJU*. fe-f-JD OW\u00a3K Jc*ntonviIlir J.ondon .

It thus includes all the part of the plain which is in the county, and also a considerable portion of the downs. A number of roads converge upon Petersfield, which give it a metropolitan air on the map. The only town near to it, from which there is no direct road, is Alton ; and, by pursuing the Bishop's Waltham road about six miles out of Alton, there is a direct road to Petersfield. The principal street, or,- at all events, the most bustling one, is thatjalong which the London road to Portsmouth passes ; but there is a handsome short street which leads westward to the mar ket-place, \u2014 a square of considerable dimensions, in which there is an equestrian statue of William III, erected by one of the Jolliffe family, who have long held much influence in this borough. The church is situated on the south side of the market-place. It is ancient, very much so, in some parts, and has an old Norman tower, the top of which commands an extensive view of the environs. The market is held on Saturday, and there are fairs for horses and sheep on the 10th of July and the 1 1th of December. The population of the town and parish was returned at 1803, in the census of 1831. In 1801, it was 1159 ; which, if the census was taken for the same extent in both cases, is an increase of more than fifty per cent, in the thirty years. Mapledur ham, about two miles to the south of Petersfield; and on the right-hand of the road in going to Portsmouth, was the paternal seat, and for some time the residence, of Gibbon, the historian of \" The Decline and Fall.\" We shall now turn our attention to the rivers, churches, villages and other matters of detail in this district ; and in doing this, it will be best to take them in three sections, in their order ; first, the valleys of the Wey and its southern branches ; secondly, the valley of the Arun \u2014 or the Rother, as it is sometimes called in this part of its course; and thirdly, the places on the downs, which cannot, with pro priety, be referred to the valley of either stream. Taken along the straight line, the valley of the Alton"], [118, "78 THE EASTERN SLOPE. branch of the Wey, \u2014 which, although not the largest, may be considered as the main stream, probably on account of its being in the line of thoroughfare, and thus the best known, \u2014 is about ten miles in length, from the boundary of the county to the summit-level at Windmill hill. On the north, or left bank, the slope follows the course of the stream, but in a succession of small hills rather than in one continuous ridge, until Alton is arrived at, and then the stream comes from the north-west, while the trend of the pass to the valley of the Itchen is south-west. The whole breadth here, from the stream to the summit, does not ave- rage above two or three miles*; and though there are a few brooks, there are none that can be considered as branches of the river, or in any way as features of the country. On the opposite, or south side, there are three branches which join the stream in the first two miles below Alton ; and these, flowing along little dells, \\ give this bank of the river a very pleasing aspect to a traveller passing along the high road on the other. For the next two miles on this side, the chalky heights, which here subside toward the green sand, are close to the stream ; and the country slopes, and the brooks, run the other way, and join the southern branch of the Wey. For the last two miles within the county, the Alder Holt forest, or copse, comes close to the right bank. This is on the green-sand formation, though there is a mixture of clay in it ; and this formation, in part, crosses the bed of the Wey, and is found upon Bently green. Between these varied banks, the little river moves slowly along, now winding in curves through rich meadows, and anon expanding into mill-ponds, often with swans sailing about in snowy majesty, and making a fine contrast with the crystal water, and the emerald meadows. This is a miniature valley, no doubt ; but it is a very pretty minia ture. Parish churches and villages cannot be numerous in a district so narrow ; more especially as it does not appear to have attracted the attention of ecclesiastics at that early"], [119, "79 THE EASTERN SLOPE. period when some other parts of Hampshire, not naturally more rich than this, were literally sown with churches. There are four parish churches and villages, exclusive of the town of Alton, in this valley : \u2014 Bently, Froyle, and Hollybourne, all on the left bank of the river, and following in the order which we have named, from the entrance of the county to Alton ; and about a mile above Alton, where there is no river, we come to the church and village of Chawton. The London road passes through the villages of Bently, Hollybourne, and Chawton ; but Froyle lies a little to the right in coming down. Bently is a very pleasant rural village, consisting of a good many houses, which are not placed in a dull and continuous line, or lines, close by the road, but generally detached, with small gardens in front, and larger ones interspersed. They are chiefly on the right-hand side of the road. (When we speak of the right-hand of the road here, we suppose the party coming down from London, and thus it is the very opposite of the right bank of the river, as the river runs the other way.) Bently green, or common, lies on the left-hand between the road and the Wey, the breadth of it being more than a quarter of a mile. This gives the place an open and airy appearance. The church is upon the rising ground, about half-a-mile to the right of the high-road. The fields in this part of the country, lie well to the sun, and are kept in fine order ; the hedge-rows are also neatly cut, which, though it may offend the admirer of the picturesque, is certainly far more in keeping with cul tivated fields than those overgrown copses, which we some times \u2014 too often indeed \u2014 meet with along the roads, keep ing them in mire in wet weather, hiding the country from the traveller, destroying a whole ridge of every field, and giving an air of closeness and unwholesomeness to the whole landscape. Hollies, and other evergreens, clipped^ are cer tainly abominations in a pleasure ground, where ornament is the only object ; but the object of all operations upon a farm is usefulness ; and therefore use is the grand ornament"], [120, "80 THE EASTERN SLOPE. there. When one looks from a hill-top upon some ill-drained fields below, where the water stagnates in the winter, and the crops toward the furrows are thin and worthless, one may find charlock supplying the blanks of the wheat in one field, and the corn poppy doing the same in another ; and the man of fanciful mind may imagine to himself that he sees rivers of gold in the bright bloom of the yellow part of the one field, and all the horrors of the lakes of gore on a battle field, in the red destructiveness of the other; but a genuine lover of the country and of man, who has learned to blend sense with sentiment, will prefer the delicate green of an unbroken wheat-field in bloom, playing like the gen tle waves of a sea of beryl in the light winds of heaven, assisting in nature's grand operation, and insuring beauty to the ripened crop, and plenty to man. \u2014 Bently is a rich and populous parish, \u2014 the rental being 4147/., and the popula tion 720. Froyle, the next parish, is much the same in character, in the breadth of its surface, as Bently ; indeed, one description may suffice for all the land on the bank below Alton. The church and village are about two miles to the west of Bently, and about a quarter of a mile to the right of the public road, from which they are in part concealed by an intervening wood. The length of the village runs along a country road, parallel to the main road, and the church is on the road ward side, of the village. The population of Froyle is 777, and the rental 4777/. Hollybourne is nearly two miles west of Froyle, and within a mile of Alton, to which it may be considered as forming a sort of suburb. Part of the village lies along the main road, and part of it along a cross-road to the right. It occupies a less breadth of surface than either of the two parishes last-mentioned. The number of inhabitants is 487, and the rental 1685/. Chawton, about a mile west of Alton, is of considerable extent ; but the land lies high, and there is a good deal of woodland. The high road passes through the village,"], [121, "81 THE EASTERN SLOPE. which contains some good houses, and is altogether a plea- sant one. About the village of Chawton, the capping of tertiary gravel comes upon the fields, and they cease to be fit for the culture of the hop. They are bleak and cold in winter ; and the soil is in some places thin, but it is sharp land, and not unfertile upon the whole. The population is 446, and the rental is 2366/. Ropley, is the next parish, in continuation of the line of those last-mentioned; but it is on the Itchen side of the summit, at least in a considerable part of its extent. It is a large parish, in an elevated situ- ation, partly on the gravel-capped grounds, and partly where the chalk appears with little or no gravelly covering over it. The valued rent of Ropley is 3732/., and the number of inhabitants 799. It must be understood that though we have mentioned Ropley here, as in the line which leads from the Alton branch of the Wey to the high downs in the cen- tre of Hampshire, yet no part of it is in the valley of any branch of the Wey. We shall now direct our attention to the southern branch of the Wey, the course of which is more irregular, and con sequently less easily traceable in such a manner as to be in telligible. The main stream of it rises in the heights, about a mile and a quarter to the south-east of the village of Chaw ton, but it is there a very insignificant brook. Its source is nearly opposite to that of the first southern branch of the Alton river, which branch joins the central stream about three-quarters of a mile below Alton ; and the hill to the westward of the junction, and immediately to the south of Alton, is the highest, close by the Alton river, on this side. From its source, this stream flows south-east along the hollow, to the village of Selborne, a distance of about two miles, in the course of which it receives some small branches from the western slope, and one rather larger from Hartley on the eastern, \u2014 the summit-level between the two branches of the Wey, being a little to the north-east of Hartley. A small branch from the southern extremity of the village of Selborne, joins the principal one immediately to the east of VOL. II. M"], [122, "82 THE EASTERN SLOPE. Selborne, and then the two, united, flow eastward along hollows, termed the Liths, past the site of the priory of Selborne, and by the church of Kingsley, and so onward between Woolmer forest on the right, and Alder holt on the left, until the border of the county is arrived at ; nor does this branch join the Alton one within Hampshire; but flows onward between the sterile surfaces of Fernsham and other commons, with barely a green line along its banks on some places, and at last joins the other branch after the remarkable flexures which that makes, about three miles to the south-east of Farnham, by the straight line, but far more by the very curiously convoluted course of the stream. In its course within the county, from Selborne downwards, this branch of the Wey receives several accessions of water, but the principal ones are from the high grounds on the north, while these continue. In the forest \u2014 or rather the de sert, there are few streams except seasonal ones ; or they just mark in summer where a little inundation may be expected in winter ; and in the hollows, such as in that between the White hill in Woolmer forest, and Greyshot down to the east, there are some marshy flats, which send the water to the Wey from the one end, and to the Arun from the other. This part of the district has no interest, except to such as are fond of the wailing of wild birds in the desert ; and of these birds there are both number and variety. Faringdon is the upper parish upon this branch of the Wey, \u2014 indeed it is on the slope of the downs, at some dis tance from the course of the brook. The country about is very open, and the population chiefly resident in a large village at the church. This village is about a mile and three-quarters south of Chawton, and half-a-mile east of the road which crosses the downs southward from Alton to West Meon. The village is compactly built, with an open space in the centre ; a street with houses on each side surrounding this open space ; and then four short continuations, along four country roads : two leading to the east, and two to the west. The shape of the village resembles an irregular four-"], [123, "83 THE EASTERN SLOPE. sided fort, with bastions at the south-east, south-west, and north-west angles. The length from south-east to north west is about half-a-mile ; and the breadth, in the cross direc tion, about three furlongs. It thus resembles a little town, and is more compact in its plan than many little towns. The church stands on the north side. The population of the parish is 504, and the rental 2281/. It will be convenient to take next, the parishes which lie on the heights to the eastward of the valley in which the south branch of the Wey makes its appearance, and which extend, north-eastward, with, first that branch, and then the low sandy grounds on the one side, and the Alton branch on the other. Beginning at the border of Faringdon, there are four of them, \u2014 Hartley, West Worldham, East World ham, and Binstead. While they continue on the heights, which they do for the greater part of their extent, they con sist of very rich land, of the white malmy consistency al ready alluded to; and there are good hop-gardens in many places, while the crops of wheat upon the other portions are very good. As one approaches the green-sand formation upon the heights, the change of the strata from ordinary chalk to the indurated calcareous free-stone, which is fitted for building, may be more easily traced than in any other part of the county. Hartley, or Hartley Maudit, occupies the southern slope ofthe heights, towards the dell at Selborne. This parish is small, with a little church something in the style of a barn ; but the ground is rich, and the rental bears a very high ratio to the population, \u2014 the former being 1695/., and the latter only 69. This is more than 24/. rent for every man, woman, and child, and would not furnish sufficient labour ers to do the work upon an agricultural soil of so strong a quality as this. But some of the farmers, and many of the labourers, reside in the adjoining village of Selborne. West Worldham is a still smaller parish, the rental being only 618/., and the population 96. It occupies the very summit of the ridge ; but it is not too high for being fertile. m 2"], [124, "84 THE EASTERN SLOPE. East Worldham is more extensive and populous : the rental being 1790/., and the number of inhabitants 212. A part of this parish descends the slope to the south-east, on the brow of which the church stands, and is a conspicuous ob ject. Below the summit, on the south-east, there is an ex ceedingly rural village, from which there is a** commanding prospect over the low grounds, and onward to the downs in Surrey and Sussex. The escarpment of the heights on this side is so steep in many places, as to appear an artificial rampart ; and, in some parts, the earth seems to have slid away and left the face of the indurated limestone, and some of the sand under it, quite bare. A very short distance eastward from this height, over land of very indifferent qua lity, brings one to the absolute sand, on which there are some little cottages, the aspect of which is dismal. Binstead, to the east of these, is a large and populous pa rish, with much of the land of good quality. The church is nearly opposite Froyle, and about a mile from the river. There is a considerable village at the church, and also some smaller ones in different parts of the parish. The sur face is pleasantly diversified with hill and dale, and clumps and copses are introduced here and there. The population is 960, and the valued rental 5518/., which is not 2000/. less than the rental of Alton, that being 7458/. Returning to the upper part of the valley of this branch of the river, at the south-east of the parish of Faringdon, we have that of Selborne, one of the most interesting parishes in Hampshire \u2014 or in any county. It is interesting for two principal reasons, \u2014 first, it is very beautiful in itself, and very varied in its beauties ; and secondly, it is identified with its historian and describer, the late Rev. Gilbert White, whose exquisitely simple, philosophical, and enchanting pages, are read with delight by everybody. It is truly refreshing, after all the marching and counter-marching which one must practise in order to have a chance of catch ing some of the physical and topographical features of a county, so provokingly varied and so chipped into little"], [125, "85 THE EASTERN SLOPE. bits as Hampshire, \u2014 it is really refreshing to come to such a place as Selborne, and by so coming conjure up the me mory of such a man. The characters of Selborne are so thoroughly embodied in the descriptions of White ; and the character of White is so fully and so* faithfully reflected by all that meets one's eyes at Selborne, that the one is a per fect artificial memory \u2014 no \u2014 a perfect natural memory, of the other. Sir Christopher Wren, or his friends, wished so to iden tify that celebrated architect with the cathedral of St. Paul's, as that the one should be a constant memorial of the other. \" If you ask for his monument, look around,\" are the words of the inscription. But the monument of Gilbert White is more mighty, and more durable, than all the structures that ever were erected by human skill. Nature there, \u2014 the earth in all its form, and in all its composition, all that grows out of it, all that lives upon its surface, or sports in the air, or the sunbeam over it, \u2014 tells of Gilbert White, and tells of him in language which cannot be mistaken. The very air breathes of him ; and there is not a turn of the season, or a phase of the atmosphere, which you can meet with here, without feel ing in your heart, \" this is exactly what White told us we should meet with at Selborne.\" Happy Selborne ! to have had such an historian to describe and consecrate your beau ties : Happy White ! to have had such a subject to inspire and exercise your delightful talent. But the grand superi ority of this naturalist is, he sought not his monument in his own works, but his living enjoyment in the works of his maker. Selborne is exactly the place for giving delight to a lover of nature. It is quite a microcosm, \u2014 a combination of all the soils of the district, from the pure chalk on the hill, to the pure sand at the lower end of the valley. Lay a line across it, from the one of those extremes of soil to the other, and you shall meet with every imaginable appearance that can be put on: \u2014 the top of the hill is at one place the naked down, in the most scanty state of vegetation ; next comes the"], [126, "86 THE EASTERN SLOPE. kindly sod of the sheep-walk, with here and there a dwarfed and gnarly tree ; then we have the thick shade of the beechen hanger, which scarcely a ray of the sun can penetrate, even when the bushes are stript of their leaves ; after this we have the sloping lawn and the rich corn-fields ; anon, we have the garden of the finest mould, rich in flowers, in vegetables, and in fruits ; then the glade, the hop-ground, the rich mea dow, the reedy pool, the babbling brook, the broad pasture, the sandy barren, the nameless jumble of water and decayed mud \u2014 the Ultima Thule of topography \u2014 nee tellus est, nee mare. All this we have ; and all this we can conceive and enjoy, before the minute hand of the time-keeper completes one revolution upon the dial. Selborne \u2014 that is the village, is situated upon a bank which extends along the east or north-east side of an oval hill, which hill is a continuation of the high grounds from Far ingdon at the north-west, and sinks down into a ravine lead ing to the upper country on the south-east ; and beyond this ravine is Norehill. The climate and soil change at Selborne hill, no part of the country behind it being properly adapted for the growth of hops. The top of the hill so far as it belongs to the parish of Selborne, is the play-ground and common grazing and sheep-walk for the inhabitants. The upper slope of the hill, on the Selborne side, is covered by the hanger \u2014 a very thick natural beech-wood, which belongs to the people for fuel, \u2014 each having the liberty of cutting more or less, according to the extent of holding in the manor. The street of the village is, in most places, the natural hard stratum of the indurated chalk and sand united ; and where there are flags, they are formed of the beds of indurated sand. There are no rounded pebbles of flint at the junction of the green sand, as there are at the junction of the tertiary strata and the chalk ; for the chalk is the last deposit, and of course there has been no violent action of the water to disturb it, as there has been where the tertiary formation overlays it ; con sequently, there is no pebbly gravel here for the paths. The two branches of the Wey, which come in by the two"], [127, "87 THE EASTERN SLOPE. ends of the village, are each in a dell, between which and the houses there is a terrace of very fine garden ground. The church and vicarage are at the northern angle of this terrace ; and between the church and the line of the street, there is a little square or open place, the Plaistow, which belongs to the inhabitants. \" Stow,\" \" stay,\" and \" sted,\" all mean a place where some one has a right to \" stay ;\" and the first part of the name, \"Plaistow,\" is simply the word \"play.\" To the south-east of the village, on the other side of the southern brook, there is a swelling ground, \u2014 the Temple farm, so called from its once having belonged to the Knights' Templar. This place is reported to have been the marriage portion of one of the wives of Sir Adam Gurdon, a celebrated adventurer in the reign of Henry III ; at which time he was a doughty plunderer for the benefit of the Mountfort family, \u2014 and of himself. Report says, that he was as successful in love as in marauding ; and married three or four wives, with all of whom he received fortunes. Report farther says, that he was a Gordon from the Scottish border ; and it is well known that the Gordons now in the north of Scotland, were banished there for their predatory habits. \"Adam a Gordon,\" is a name not unknown in old Border legend ; but whether this was the same Adam, there are no data for ascertain ing. At all events he appears to have followed the example of the Saxon kings, in bestowing his worldly possessions upon the religious establishments \u2014 when he was no longer able to enjoy them, and was at the same time haunted by the ghosts of his former deeds. The Temple farm is good land ; the parts of it on the slope of the dell answer well for hops, and the eastern slope, in common with the slopes on the opposite side of the dells, produces oak timber of good quality. The dell, which is called the \" Liths,\" that is, \" the bends, or flexures,\" leads from the village to the place on which the priory of Selborne formerly stood. This was founded by Rupibus, or St. Roque, a Norman adventurer at the court of King John, who contrived to become bishop of Winchester, and lord justice of England ; he was sent to the Holy Land to"], [128, "88 THE EASTERN SLOPE. learn piety, and on his return to England and to favour, took the old way of founding expiatory houses for the support of the monastic orders. But tastes change in these as well as in laical fancies ; and it became the fashion to endow col leges ; so, William of Waynflete, bishop of Winchester, at last procured the suppression of the priory of Selborne, and the transfer of its property \u2014 the manor of Selborne among the rest, to the college of St. Mary Magdalen, which he had founded in Oxford; and the college are the proprietors of the manor to this day. Only a random stone of the building is now to be met with, and that in the wall of some farm house or building. There have been some stone coffins found, and fragments of the old stained glass, devitrified on the surface by being buried in the ground ; and the farmer who now rents the ground, has picked up as many of the red Venetian or Bologna tiles, once generally used for sacerdotal pavement, as have made a substantial floor for the summer house in his garden. The site of the priory is the last subject of interest which the visitor finds in descending the course of the stream from Selborne toward the sandy wastes, where there is little to attract his attention. \u2014 We had forgotten to mention in its proper place, that the rental of Selborne was returned at 4324/., and the population at 924. Below Selborne there are only two parishes on this branch of the Wey, \u2014 Kingsley, and Headley ; and it is doubtful whe ther the latter should be referred to the district of the Wey, or to that of the Arun or Rother, as it is situated in that marshy flat between Woolmer forest and Greystone common, where the same marsh sends a winter stream to each river; and none to either when the weather is dry. Both these parishes are large, and contain a number of inhabitants, but the land is flat, and they are places of little interest. Kings ley is on the verge of the wilderness, but it contains some ex cellent farms and grazing lands. The rental of it is 2395/., and the population 345. Headley is in the middle of the wilderness, and the ground on which the greater part of it"], [129, "89 THE EASTERN SLOPE. lies, is not a very desirable oasis: the population is 1228, and the rental 3157/. Our next business is to notice the objects of interest which are properly referable to the valley of the Arun or Rother ; or to the flat grounds, the streams and brooks of which empty themselves into that river; and, as it leaves the county by one outlet, we shall take it from its exit from the county to its source in the declivity of the downs. The parish of Bramshot is, indeed, a kind of exception to this ; for it lies in the same doubtful situation between the tenantless moors as Headley ; and it is not easy to say, whether it is on the north or the south of the absolute summit-level. Itis about two miles and a half to the south-east of Headley ; like that, it consists of very poor soil; and is of great extent, with a small rental in proportion to the number of inhabitants. The population is 1510, and the rental 3714-7. Bramshot is a very little to the north of the great road from London, through Guildford, to Portsmouth ; and it is within two miles of the extreme eastern boundary of the county of Hants. Surrey ceases to be on the east of Hants, about two miles east-and-by-south of Bramshot, and Sussex be gins. The first meeting of the two counties is something like that of the tertiary strata and the chalk ; for there is much confusion and breaking of the one into the other. The land is certainly not so especially valuable here as to occasion so much trouble. The general line of separation between the two counties is as irregular and complicated as can well be imagined. An irregular tongue of Sussex pro jects northwards about two miles into Hants, along the east ern side of the- south, or Bridger hill end, of Woolmer fo rest ; and, as if to make sure that the two counties shall not separate, a small portion projects eastward near the north end of this tongue, dove-tailing the counties together as it were. Even this has not been deemed enough ; for, about a mile to the south of Bramshot, and just on the south-west of Liphook, there is an irregular patch of Sussex, about half-a mile long, and a quarter broad, quite detached from the rest VOL. II. N"], [130, "90 THE EASTERN SLOPE. of that county ; and having the appearance of a peg to secure the dove-tail. The planners of the county of Hants appear to have been equally zealous to grapple Sussex ; for, about two miles without the boundary of the county to the east of Bramshot, and upon the border of Surrey near Haslemere, a patch of Hampshire begins, and extends southward, for about nine miles, right across the Arun or Rother, by the eastward of Medhurst, and so onward to the foot of the chalk ridge. This patch nowhere exceeds three-quarters of a mile in breadth ; and in some places it is not even a fur long. It is falchion-shaped; and if one could venture to say as much upon so grave a subject as the division of counties, it appears as if some Hampshire giant of the olden time had lost his glave in the wilds of Sussex. After this confusion, the boundary is somewhat regular ; and after passing the sandy height of Rate down, it crosses the river little more than a mile to the east of Petersfield. Besides Petersfield itself and Steep, Buriton is the only pa rish within the amphitheatre of hills, of which Petersfield forms the centre ; and we believe that Petersfield, strictly speaking, is only a chapelry of Buriton. The village of Buriton is very pleasantly situated in the entrance of one of the sloping passes that lead to the top of the down ; and it stands upon a favourable level ; high enough for having fresh air and a commanding prospect, but not so high as to be bleak. There are various little villages spotted about between Buriton and the river ; and the pleasant house and grounds of Nursted lie midway between Buriton and Pe tersfield, and about a mile from each. Buriton is a very large and populous parish ; and the land, towards the slope of the hills, is rich and arable, though, towards the river, it passes into the grazing grounds. These are valuable, from the permanence of the grass upon them, and also on account of its quality, though not so much so as first-rate corn lands. Few parishes in Hampshire have a higher rental than Buri ton. Mitcheldever is a little higher, but 'the two parishes come near to each other, both in population and in rental."], [131, "91 THE EASTERN SLOPE. The population of Buriton is 822 ; and the rental 8229/., which is just about 10/. rent for each inhabitant: Mitchel dever has 936 people, and the rental is 8334/. ; so that the rent is not so high in proportion to the number of people as in Buriton. Steep lies on the other side of Petersfield from Buriton, that is to say, on the north-west, and the church is at nearly the same distance. About Steep, the fields are rich, con sisting of small secondary hills, below the greater elevation of the chalk; and they are beautifully diversified by wood and fine streams of water. The church stands upon an emi nence, without any village in the immediate neighbourhood ; and none of the villages in the parish are large. Steep mill, on a stream which issues from an opening in the chalk hills, is an exceedingly beautiful spot. The hills to the north are well expressive of the name of the place, as the ascent is in some places greater than the base which it occupies. They are also well wooded ; and the woods are judiciously broken by open glades, and diversified by trees of different species. The entrance of the dell just above the mill is particularly beautiful. Steep is a populous parish, but the rental is much lower than that of Buriton. There are 835 people in the parish, and the rent is 3157/., which is not much more than one-third to each individual, as compared to Buriton. We shall now notice the parishes which lie upon the low grounds more immediately on the banks of the main stream of the Arun, or rather where its course is towards the south. There are three of them, Lyss, on the .right bank of the river, about three miles and a half north-and-by-east of Petersfield, on the straight line ; Greatham on the left bank, nearly two miles north-east of Lyss ; Empshott on the left bank, about two miles north-west of Lyss, and about half-a mile north of the river on that part of the course which is from the west ; and, we may add, Hawkley, opposite Emp shott, and about a mile south of the river. All these parishes lie, for the greater part of their surface at least, upon the white land, though there is in them a gradual transition from n 2"], [132, "92 THE EASTERN SLOPE. thin chalk lands, on the western elevation, to a sandy soil, on the margin of the forest. Lyss contains 663 inhabitants, and a rental of 2586/. Greatham is a less valuable parish, lying near the elevated part of the forest. Its population is 238, and its rental 1052/. Empshott, which lies more among the chalky hills, is a small parish, but valuable in proportion to its extent. The population is 149, and the rental 721/. Hawkley is nearly the same character of soil as Empshott ; but the parish is of greater extent. The population is 277, and the rental 1772/. It only remains to notice the few parishes upon the downs, which cannot, strictly speaking, be referred to the valley of the river, although the general slope is to the east in all this part of the natural district, as we have endeavoured to point out its boundaries. The first parish is Neivton, or Newton Valence, immediately behind Selborne hill, upon the western shoulder of which the church and parsonage are situated. This is in great part an upland parish, but not unfertile. The rental of it is 1816/., and the population 289. Prior s Dean, about two miles to the south of Newton, is a very hilly parish, remarkable for the beauty of its scenery, or at all events, for the diversity of its surface. It lies in a dell among the high downs to the south of Var down ; and it contains but few inhabitants. Ihe church is very small, and stands solitary in the dell, with the excep tion of a single farm-steading. The population of this parish is 166, and the rental 991/. Some ofthe hill-tops in this parish are thin land, and rather exposed; but, as is always the case in hilly countries, the slopes and dells are proportionally rich. East Tisted is on the high grounds about a mile to the north-west of Var down, and on the left of the road from Alton to the valley of the river Bere or Beer, which, east ward of the Itchen, is the principal stream in the southern slope of the county. The parish occupies a considerable breadth of country, and there are many open downs and commons ; but still the rental and population are considera ble\u2014the former being 1869/., and the latter 232. Cole-"], [133, "93 THE EASTERN SLOPE. more, the church of which is rather more than a mile to the east of East Tisted, is still more on the downs, and more naked of timber. The number of inhabitants is 164, and the valued rent 934/. This parish has acquired some celebrity on account of having been the birth-place of John Groves, Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford, in the reign of Charles II. Froxfield, about three miles and a half to the south of Colemore, is an extensive parish, and in general more fertile than the two last-named. It contains a popula tion of 618, and the rent is valued at 4269/. The last parish which lies within the limits that we have pointed out for this natural division of the county, is Privet, which lies about two miles to the north-west from Froxfield. The population is 225, and the rental 1388/. Ihe country here consists of an alternation of downs, cultivated fields, and clumps of wood; rather bleak upon the whole, but in no place absolutely barren ; and about a mile north of the church, are the mansion and grounds of Basing house, which, however, is not so celebrated in story as its more ancient namesake, near Basingstoke. A few miles to the southward where Barrow hill is situ ated, the dry downs are very narrow, compared to what they are in many places ; for, the sources of some of the eastern rivers are not more than two miles from those of the first streams of the Bere. There is thus a sort of passage here, between down and down, the same as there is at Basingstoke, and again at Windmill hill. As we come southward, how ever, those passes increase in steepness and difficulty. The pass at Basingstoke admits of the passage of a railway with very little change of gradiant ; and it would admit of a canal if there were a supply of water at the summit. The pass at Windmill hill admits of a road, which, though steep, is not so much so as to be dangerous ; but precludes the possibility of either canal or railroad. The pass at Barrow hill, which, from stream to stream, is much the shortest of the three, does not admit of a very easy road \u2014 of a road suited for general traffic. There is a country road by each side of the"], [134, "94 THE EASTERN SLOPE. hill ; but it has been found more eligible to lay down the line of thoroughfare from Winchester to Petersfield, upon the downs to the north ; and thus there is no direct line from the vale or plain of Petersfield to that of the Bere, as there is from the valley of the Wey to the valley of the Itchen. Indeed, the surface of the western portion of this eastern slope of Hampshire, which lies between the two chalk ridges, and inclines toward the green sand and the wealden bed of Sussex, is so irregular, that communication with it is everywhere difficult, excepting by the roads from London by Guildford and Farnham ; and both of these lead to Peters field through the least valuable part of the district: for which reason neither of them opens a ready communication between the most valuable part of it, and any general mar ket where its produce can be disposed of. The same may be said of the road from Alton to the western valley across the downs ; for that follows the western margin of the dis trict nearly along the summit, and thus it is nowhere of easy access to the inhabitants of the central parts of the district. On the east it is the same ; for the roads, near the bottom of the hills, are, from the nature of the soil, very heavy, and impassable with a heavy load in wet weather ; neither are there any materials at hand by which they can be made bet ter. These are natural disadvantages of which no art can get the better ; and they are no doubt the principal reasons why we find so few remains of religious houses, and so very few habitations of the wealthy, in a district of the county where the soil is, in many places, so rich, and the scenery so beautiful. Such are the natural features, and the natural advantages and disadvantages, of the eastern slope of Hamp shire."], [135, "95 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. CHAPTER IV. THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. The natural division of Hants, of which we proceed to give some account, is that which occupies the south-eastern quarter of the county. It is a district of great interest, \u2014 from its position, from the vast extent and peculiarity of its sea-coast, from the varied character of its soil, and the diver sified aspect of its surface ; but it is, at the same time, a district of which it is difficult to obtain, and still more diffi cult to communicate, anything like a general notion. Hamp shire, taken on the whole, notwithstanding its beauty, its fertility, the extreme healthfulness of its climate, and the many and important historical events of which it has been the theatre, is quite a puzzle to the topographical describer. There are many local beauties, and some spots of much phy sical as well as pictorial interest ; but the scene is so conti nually shifting, that there is no breadth upon which a satis factory generalization can be established. It is a sort of nucleus county, it is true, \u2014 whole and central within itself; and, although a maritime one, not a marginal, in its geological formation, or in the inclination of its surface. It forms the central portion of the chalk formation of England; for, though this formation ramifies to a great extent, the grand central mass, from which the principal number of those ridges"], [136, "96 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. of chalk radiate, is in Hampshire and the adjoining part of Wilts. As the peculiar distribution of the chalk formation must be known before we can properly understand the natural characters of several of the Hampshire districts ; and espe cially of that one, the name of which we have placed at the head of this chapter, we shall offer a few general remarks upon it, the more especially as we have now come to the last of those natural divisions, which lie partly on the chalk, and pass into other formations as they approach the borders of the county. In an earlier portion of the work, we could not have done this, either so briefly, or in a manner so free from technical phraseology ; because, we were not then in possession of those points of local reference, which bring matters of this kind more home to the reader, than cold and theoretical disquisitions. Besides, there is evidence, in the nature of the formations, which are superposed upon the margins of the chalk ; and which, in some places, cap its greatest elevations, that this same chalk has been the anvil upon which nature has worked all the different soils of the county of Hants, \u2014 of which soils, the southern slope of the county offers an endless, and constantly-changing variety. In all the ramifications of the chalk which radiate from the central plateau in Hants and Wilts, we find that forma tion cropping out, at least at one side of the ridge, upon an earlier formation ; but, with the exception of the eastern margin toward Surrey, south of the Wey, and Sussex, north of the ridge at Buriton hanger, near Petersfield, we find the chalk in Hampshire overlaid at its margin's end, variously capped and covered at the tertiary formation ; and this ap pears to have been for a long time worked upon the chalk, by a powerful action of the water, as all the pebbles which are found in its gravel are, almost without exception, chalk flints, which have been subjected to long and severe at trition. The mean length of this great mass of chalk, from the downs near Petersfield, to the western termination in Wilts,"], [137, "97 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. is about fifty miles, of which, taking the average of the ir- regular boundaries, more than thirty miles are in Hamp- shire ; and the breadth, which, notwithstanding the zig-zag margins, does not vary much upon the whole, may be esti- mated at about twenty miles, \u2014 so that there are within the county about six hundred square miles of chalk formation, which greatly exceeds the portion in any other county of England. The ramifications of the chalk, from this central plateau, are four in number. The longest one stretches north-east from the western part of the plateau, nearly two hundred miles, to the northern extremity of Norfolk. It is irregular in its boundaries, \u2014 its breadth being more than twenty miles in somex places, and not above two or three in others. But, along the whole of its north-western boundary, which, including the windings, is nearly three hundred miles, it crops out upon the green sand ; and the green sand again appears under it, in the Isle of Wight, though the upper oolite, and various clays, are found under the steep but narrow ridge, which turns round the sources of the streams that discharge their waters into the harbour of Poole, and terminates in Ballard down, about three miles and a half south from the entrance to that harbour. The termi- nation of this narrow chalk ridge, is not more than sixteen or seventeen miles, to the west of the Needles, which are obviously fragments of the chalk down which traverses the greatest length of the Isle of Wight, and which is very evi- dently a part of the same ridge with that which we have mentioned as approaching the shore to the southward of Poole. In the Isle of Wight, we have this ridge exposed to the destroying action of the tides and winds ; first, from the Needles to some distance eastward of the curiously caverned portion at Freshwater bay ; and again, in the cliffs at Culver near the eastern extremity of the island ; but in the midland part, the green sand, and under that, the upper oolite, appear as supporting the southern margin of the chalk. We will, of course, enter into the details of the strata in the Isle of Wight, in another volume of this work, where we shall have VOL. ii. o"], [138, "98 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. to notice that very interesting island as our principal sub ject; but a glance at the chalk ridge in the island is im portant to the object which we now have in view, \u2014 that of endeavouring to ascertain what influence the grand and pre dominating rock-formation in Hampshire has had in pro ducing the very curious mixture of soils, which occurs at such short distances in that part ofthe county which slopes southward in the direction of the Isle of Wight. This extreme westerly ridge of the English chalk forma tion, though it has been worn away by the action of the water, so as to form the opening between the part in Dor set and the Needles, has obviously been the southern boun dary of the whole chalk-field, chalk-basin, or whatever it may deserve to be called ; for the strata which appear un der it at the outward side, are of the same character as those along the whole external line, from the extremity in Norfolk, to the southern formation on the coast to the south ward of Poole, while on the interior, the other formations, rest upon the chalk. The other external margins, are on the north side of the ridge, which extends from the plateau in Hants to Beachy head, and which has again been as sailed by the waters, from Beachy head westward to a point about midway between Brighton and Worthing, where the chalk leaves the coast, \u2014 and the south side of the Kent and Surrey ridge, from Hythe to the confines of Hampshire, and so round by the eastern part of that county until it meets the former. Throughout the whole of them the green sand occurs as it does on the opposite side of the chalk, only the wealden-bed and not the oolite is under it in this part. The chalk downs which form the natural boundary on the north to the southern slope of Hampshire, are therefore, the northern margin of a basin or depression in the chalk, the southern one having in great part been worn away, though it still appears in the Isle of Wight, and in Dorset shire. This basin, though of smaller extent, has been sub jected to more severe action of water than the basin which contains the valley of the Thames, and\" extends as far as"], [139, "99 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. Norfolk, \u2014 and indeed passes through Lincoln and Yorkshire, as far as between Flamborough head and Scarborough. The consequence is, that both in the ridge which traverses the Isle of Wight, and in the southern side of the Hampshire plateau, the chalk is more broken into knolls, and intersected by deeper ravines, or scoopings, than in most places farther to the north. In Dorset, and all through the Isle of Wight, the ridge is cross-cut into lengths, which do not appear to have been severed from each other by any action that we can attribute to presently existing causes. It is true that there are small brooks and rills of water in most of the hol lows which extends from those intersections of the downs ; but they are so trifling that they could not possibly have formed the passes through the ridges, and they do not in general begin at the summits. The southern side of the downs, which form the natural boundary of the district of Hampshire which we are to examine, are full of curious dells, often cleft a great way into the ridge, but rounded at their terminations, and not having the least appearance of being in any way results of the action of streams of water ; and the rounded and elevated portions of the chalk are so intermixed with, and almost inclosed by, the gravel and clay of the tertiary formation, that it is difficult to frame any general description which shall assign to each its pro per place. The clays are most abundant, and generally of a more tenacious quality, immediately under the chalk heights ; anil at a greater distance, where the tertiary matters swell into heights, the summits of these are very generally composed of light and sandy soil, which has very little fertility. One would be inclined to suppose that this land has been acted upon both by a sea-flood and a land-flood, after the deposit and consolidation of the chalk. All along the south ern edgfe of the downs which inclose the basin in the north, the action of the sea-flood has been violent and long con tinued ; as is obvious by the rounding of the pebbles. The number of them also shows, that the action of this flood o 2"], [140, "100 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. must have been exerted for a very long time, and must have disintegrated a vast quantity of chalk, before so very many worn flints could have been in the gravel. It is equally worthy of remark, that the signs of this action do not extend up the beds of the present rivers, so as to give us cause to believe that their valleys had existed at the time, or that they have been produced by the same action of the water which disintegrated the chalk and abraded and rounded the pebbles. The action which produced these last-named ef fects, seems to have followed nearly the outline of the di rection of chalk ; and while it left the rounded pebbles chiefly in the vicinity of the chalk, or near the tough clays, it seems to have borne off the sand into certain eddies, \u2014 which the position of the chalk is such as would lead us to conclude could have been formed by the currents of the sea, even under that depth of water which has carried the gra vel and other matters of the tertiary formation to the sum mits of some very elevated portions of the chalk. One of the most remarkable of these apparently eddy-formed de posits is, that to the northward of the detached chalk ridge of Portsdown, and which extends from the border of Sussex \u2014 into that county indeed ; and, stretching a little to the north-west, approaches within a short distance of Bishop's Waltham. This nearly follows the general bend of the chalk heights, the centre of it being about three miles north of Portsdown, and double the distance south of the succession of high downs which project westward from Butser hill, and terminate to the eastward of Meon Stoke, after a stretch of about six miles eastward from Butser hill. These downs are very bleak on the summits, and have little or no soil there but a mere pellule of vegetable mould over the chalk, and the flints which appear on the surface are nearly of the same form which they have in the chalk; and thus, cannot have been much rolled about, or otherwise acted upon by any continued flood of water. From the character of these elevated portions of the downs it is evident, that the action of the water which accumulated"], [141, "101 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. in its eddies such immense quantities of gravel, sand, and clay, as that which we have noticed to the northward of Portsdown, cannot possibly have come from the north-east, nor can any portion of the deposit have been derived from the green sand. Indeed, at the places where the chalk crops out upon the sand, there is no such apparent disturbance of the chalk, and rolling and abrasion of its flints, as we find where it is overlaid by the tertiary formation. Thus it appears, that the hollows external of the chalk formation have not been produced by the same action which has been exerted in forming the irregularities of the interior basins which are in the chalk itself. Indeed, upon the very elevated portions of the chalk ridges, there is exceedingly little evi dence of external action of any kind, further than the* mere surface-action of the weather ; and this holds true of tbe dis rupted heights in the Isle of Wight and in Dorset, as well as in those of this, the opposite boundary of the basin. How the chalk came to remain elevated, in those streaky and often narrow ridges in which we find it, is a problem which perhaps none can solve ; but it is at least highly probable, that the basins which contain matters of more recent formation than the chalk, have been formed by a subsiding of that, and not by a wearing away. This must have been the result of volcanic action of some kind or other, though there are certainly no surface evidences of such ac tion in any of the chalk districts, or in their vicinity. Still, we can draw from this no satisfactory conclusion of the im possibility of such a subsidence of the chalk as would have formed either the valley of the Thames, or this less exten sive but more curious chalk valley, which lies between the downs stretching from Wilts to Beachy head, and the south ern chalk ridge in Dorset and the Isle of Wight. We know that earthquakes, and surface volcanoes \u2014 the latter of which cannot be very deeply seated, as much of the matter they eject is calcined, and thus must be subjected to heat and at mospheric air ; \u2014 we know that these can agitate the sur face to the extent of hundreds of miles; and, therefore,"], [142, "102 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. though we cannot prove the affirmative, we can as little prove the negative, that an elevation of volcanic rock, in a distant part of Britain, or even of Europe, may have suf ficed to form an internal chamber in the earth, into which the chalk stratum may have subsided, so as to form beds for the tertiary matters which the action of the waters has sub sequently gathered into them. If these events did occur \u2014 and some such events there must have been, to proeluce those effects which are palpable to the most ordinary observation, then the water of the ocean may have come from a distance to fill those hollows for a time, and choked itself with the fragments of ruin which its own havoc may have brought about. But, in the south of Hampshire and in the rest of what we may term the most southerly depression of the chalk in England, there has been an agent at work of which we have no such evidence in the greater and more northerly basin which contains the valley of the Thames, and all the mari time part of the east of England, as far as the extremity of Norfolk. In that northern basin, there is not, excepting what may reasonably be regarded as the alluvium gradually accumulated by the rivers, anything which can be regarded as a fresh-water formation, while there is such a formation in the southern one. This formation is not a little curious \u2014 at all events it is sufficiently so to excite a desire of infor mation upon such an anamoly. All along the south side of the chalk-down boundary of this basin, from Beachy head to the most westerly point which it reaches, and also along that portion of the same enclosing ridge, which, after curv ing to the south, turns eastward in Dorsetshire, there is no fresh- water formation other than the common deposit of the rivers. But in the Isle of Wight, the whole to the northward of the chalk is a fresh-water formation, except in so far as that has been covered by gradual deposits from the streams. The distance of this formation is not great, either from the New Forest on the one hand, or from the southern slope of Hampshire on the other ; but still, there is no continuation"], [143, "103 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. of the fresh-water formation in either of them. There is some crag in the New Forest, stretching from near Lyming ton to the Southampton Water, and extending up as far as Hythe ; and this answers, in great part, to the soil of the sandy heights on the other side of the water, both to the eastward and to the westward of the Itchen. But this is a mere surface-bed of marine formation, something similar to what we have mentioned as lying to the north of Portsdown, and such beds are not rare on the tertiary formation, and they are sometimes on the chalk. Any animal remains which they contain, are, however, marine, and they often have layers of shells in them, the inhabitants of which must have lived in the sea. The accumulation of crag in the New Forest is not only different from the fresh-water formation in the Isle of Wight, but there is an actual interruption on the land \u2014 a stripe of common tertiary formation between this crag and the Solent, immediately across which the Isle of Wight lies. This fresh-water formation in the Isle of Wight is curious, from appearing within the one margin only of the chalk basin, while there is not a vestige of it near the other. It is not a formation which has been gra dually deposited at the bottom of a lake, or any other por tion of fresh-water in a tranquil state ; for its surface is, in many places, exceedingly irregular ; and the layers of which it is composed are twisted and contorted, as if they had been brought there by water in a state of violent agitation. It has been forced, by some means or other, against a very steep escarpment of the chalk ; and a very fine section of their meeting, as well as of this formation itself, can be seen at Alum bay to the north-east of the Needles, where the action of the sea and the weather are continnally wearing away both the chalk on the south side of the bay, and the fresh water formation on the east. Whence or how this formation was brought and deposited here, and in no other part of this basin, or indeed in any other of the British island, so far as we are aware, it is im possible to say and would be useless to conjecture ; but"], [144, "104 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. there seems little doubt that the disintegrated particles of this formation, with other matters brought down by the rivers, thrown back by the eddy of the current, and not carried round the Silsea bill, along with the drift of shingle, contributes not a little to the fitness of some of the alluvial soils, especially about Portsmouth, for the growth of some species of culinary vegetables. These low grounds are situated in what may be considered as the cess-pool for the lighter debris of the sea-worn cliffs to the westward, and also for whatever the waters and the land-floods may bring down ; and it is thus highly probable that, within the period of authenticated history, considerable and valu able aelditions may have been made to the low lands. An opinion has sometimes been started, that the channel, be tween the mainland and the Isle of Wight here, was in for mer times dry at low-water ; but this is not probable ; for, on the contrary, the banks within the narrow seas appear to be increasing, and the return bank from the east is cer tainly approaching the entrance of Portsmouth harbour ; so that it may in time, though of course in a very long time, render that harbour impracticable for ships of the same bur den as it can now admit with ease. Thus, independently altogether of its present importance and value, the conside ration of this mutilated fragment of a chalk basin is highly interesting, both in a prospective and a retrospective point of view. There is another matter of very great interest with re gard to this part of the coast of England, which we may here notice very briefly, though it does not apply exclu sively to Hampshire, and perhaps applies less to it than to any other of the counties which abut on the channel. This is the eastward motion of the shingle or pebbles, which is a great annoyance along the whole line of the channel coast, at least from Dorsetshire eastward. When the wind blows and the swell rolls from the westward, these pebbles, which are rounded on the beaches along which they are rolled, march eastward, literally en masse, and though they probably"], [145, "105 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. pause many tides, and also many calms, by the way, such of them as are not stranded on the intermediate shores, then reach Dover, and even beyond it, and thus add to the banks which accumulate where the tides meet, very much to the annoyance and danger of the navigation. The rounding of these pebbles, by the agitation of the wind, and especially by the roll of the waves, and the distance to which they are carried, throws no inconsiderable light upon the manner in which the flint pebbles in the tertiary formation, must have been rounded and distributed, when the chalk \u2014 probably without any protection even from the rain by a covering of vegetation, formed the only beaches against which the winds and the waves beat. The pebbles which form the present banks and beaches, and which are found to be in many places so annoying, are certainly very numerous \u2014 far, beyond the power of any ordinary arithmetic ; but numerous as they are, they are not one in a million \u2014 one in many mil lions, to those which have been separated from the disinte grated chalk, and are now scattered through the immense extent of the superincumbent gravel. With these ancient pebbles of the interior, the case must have been different, however, from what it is with the present travelling pebbles of the Channel. The ancient pebbles must have been formed in the places where they are now found ; or, at all events, they have not been moved to any very great distance, for they are mixed with sand, clay, and other matters in more minute division; whereas, when pebbles are carried along by a current of the water, they are washed as they roll on, not only from sand and mud, but they are sorted, the largest ones being carried the greatest distance. Thus, we find that, where the sea is wearing away the land, the chalk, and sand, and other matters which are in a state of minute division are deposited in the nearest eddy, whether' behind a project ing point of the land, or formed by the meeting of currents of the water, while the pebbles are carried farther to the east, or deposited where the action of the currents of water is more violent. The projecting points of gravel, locally VOL. II. P"], [146, "106 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE called \" hards,\" which are so numerous in -the narrow seas between the Isle of Wight and the mainland of Hampshire, are formations of this kind; and show that the action of the current has, even in the Southampton Water above Cal shot castle, been once much greater than it is now. The banks which have formed in advance of the western entrance to the Solent at Hurst castle, must be taken in as part of the system, in order to arrive at a proper understand ing of what is now going on in the narrow seas of Hamp shire, in cutting away the land at some places and forming deposits in others. The curve of the coast, from Durlston head south of Poole, to Hengistbury head off Christchurch, gives a circular motion to the current, by means of which, in part at least, the second high-water is dropped into Poole harbour ; and, the bay of Christchurch is in great part en closed by banks, leaving only about a mile and a half of opening between Christchurch ledge on the west and Dol phin bank on the south, and another opening on the east, not half-a-mile from bank to bank, between the shingly beach, upon the extremity of which Hurst castle is erected, and the Shingles, which extend nearly three miles from this opening south-westward, until they almost join the Dol phin. The three banks just mentioned combine with the form of the shore, and with the resistance offered by the Isle of Wight immediately to the eastward, in giving a very pecu liar, motion to the tidal currents in this part of the channel ; and as this has a considerable influence upon the action of the water in the narrow seas between the island and the mainland, it may not be improper to take some notice of it here. Before doing this, however, it may be as well to mention that, between the bill of Portland and Dover \u2014 a distance of about one hundred and sixty miles, there are six hours difference of tide ; or, in other words, the height of the tidal wave in the mid-channel is very nearly upon the one of these places, when, the depth of the trough of low water is upon the other. The difference of elevation between"], [147, "107 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. these, occasions a slope, varying according to the position of the moon and the state of the weather. The elevation-end of this slope is alternately at the bill of Portland, and at Dover ; and thus, the tides, that is, the ridges of high-wa ter travel eastward, in mid-channel, at the rate of thirty miles an hour ; yet there is an alternation of sufficient slope eastward and westward, for enabling vessels to slide upon the inclined plane with the turn of the tides ; and not only this, but there is a dropping or actual transfer of the water westward with the ebb, especially where there are obstacles presented by the jutting inequalities of the shore ; and this transfer of the water is the main cause of the return tides, and also of the banks which form in advance of those points which project south-eastward, and also in many parts of the narrow seas. In the open Channel there are no banks, at least none which rise so near to the surface as those in the North Sea ; because, though a portion of the tide near the shores is dropped in the manner which we have endeavoured to ex plain, there is only one main tide in the Channel, and thus there is not the same stagnation and eddy produced by op posite movements of the water, as there are in the North Sea, where the tide sets southward on the British coast, and northward on that of the continent. But in the land-locked and embayed places, the dropped part of the tide runs coun ter to the portion more seaward ; and thus, though upon a smaller scale, there is the same kind of deposit as we meet with between the east of England and the continent. It is the same shortness of distance between high and low water in the Channel, which renders the exposed parts of the Channel coast so very dangerous to shipping. At the bill of Selsea, for example, there are two hours title between that point and the parallel of the southern point of the Isle of Wight, although the absolute distance off the shore is only from ten to twenty miles, according to circumstances. This continues as far eastward as Beachy head ; and, there fore, there is a very considerable slope shoreward, which p 2"], [148, "108 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. renders it very dangerous to approach the land, especially when the wind is at south ; though the very same circum stance facilitates the arrival and departure of vessels, to and from the grand anchorage at Spithead, the harbour of Portsmouth, and all other places of safety or resort for shipping, in those narrow seas which are protected by the Isle of Wight. We may now return to the oval basin forming the bay of Christchurch, and having the gravelly soil of the mainland on the north, and the banks, which we have alreaely named, on the south. Christchurch ledge extends about three miles south-eastward, and varies in breadth from a mile to a quar ter of a mile, with not more than three fathoms water in some places. It has obviously been produced by the drift of shingle eastward along the southern side, and the re-ac tion of the elropped portion of the tidal current upon the north, which has transferred to this place some of the peb bles, and other matters of the disintegrated shore, upon which the sea makes continual inroads, from the entrance of Christchurch to Hurst castle. The bank extends across the embouchure of the united waters of the Avon and the Stour, and forms an embankment on each side of the imme diate entrance to the harbour. That harbour is much choked up by deposits ; but a small channel is kept open by the discharge of the river-water, which, as it is partially dammed up in the basin of the harbour, acts against the dropped tide, much in the same way as that tide acts against the main tide in the Channel in forming Christchurch ledge. The deep curve of the western part of the bay, from the mainland to the ledge, turns the same dropped tide against the main tide, especially that portion of it which sets north-eastward from the Needles to Hurst castle, and which acts with such violence in wearing away the land there. The Dolphin appears to be almost exclusively a tidal bank. It is three miles long from east to west, but not above a quarter of a mile in average breadth, though on some parts of it the water shallows to between two and"], [149, "THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. 109 three fathoms. It offers but little obstruction to the east ward current, because the length lies in the direction of that current ; but it has very considerable influence in producing the violent action of the water upon the adjacent part of the Isle of Wight. It prevents the main current from spread ing northward, and thus the water runs with far greater velocity along the Isle of Wight shore, than it does along the mainland shore ; and hence, even after the action of the water ceases to wear the land, there is no bank of any con sequence upon the Isle of Wight shore so the westward of Cowes. The third bank, the Shingles, is about two miles and a half in length, in the form of an irregular triangle, about a mile in breadth opposite the point at which Hurst castle stands, and terminating in a point southward, very near to the eastern extremity of the Dolphin. Indeed, the two may be considered as one bank, which shifts its posi tion with the state of the weather. The Shingle's portion is the most variable part of it ; and the action upon it is so strong, that the pebbles of which it is composed are piled up so as to be above the high-water level ; but the portion so piled changes very much both in its extent and its ele vation. At the south and the east of the Shingles, there are some rocks which may have in part aided in the forma tion of that bank, but still its existence is mainly owing to the greater velocity of the water on the Isle of Wight side than on that of the mainland. That a bank may, to some extent, be formed, even when the current sets with violence, and when there is a divergence and parting ra ther than the confluence of one current with another, is proved by the fact that there is a rudimental bank,* ot only between the rocks of the Needles, but in advance of them, about a mile from the land, and to within about the same distance of the south end of the Shingles. The materials of which these banks are formed, have been brought chiefly from the westward ; and they are obviously dropped por tions of the grand drift which accumulates in so many places"], [150, "110 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. to the westward, and which is so especially abundant about Dover. No part ofthe projecting \" hard,\" or causeway, upon which Hurst castle is built, has come from the east by the return tide ; for all behind the castle \u2014 that is to the eastward of it, the banks are mud ; while, on the opposite side, the coast of the island is strewed with its own ruins. This point is, therefore, a natural barrier to the eastward motion of the pebbles, though its advance into the channel between, must be, in part, promoted by the Shingles. The beach here is advancing into the water at a pretty rapid rate, though the additions are by no means regular, neither is there any pro bability that it shall ever make such advances as to form a mole across the Solent to the island. The current upon the other shore is too powerful for admitting of this ; but there has been an obvious diminution of the action of the water on all the western and northern shores of the narrow seas, until one comes as far eastward as that the stronger current, through the channel by the Needles, acts upon them. Along the shores of the Southampton Water there are many \"hards,\" or projecting points, of more compost materials than are to be found on either side of them ; but instead of any such being in progress at the present time, there is very little transfer even of the silt and mud. The advance of the causeway at Hurst castle farther into the sea, and probably also the increase of the shingle, which appears to keep pace with it, have, within the course of the last century, produced considerable alterations in the action of the water upon the shores within the Solent. Calshot castle, at the southern entrance of the Southampton Water, was origkially built on an island, and remained insulated till the early part of the eighteenth century, since which time it has been united to the land, first by an accumulation of gra velly matter, and now there is an accumulation of mud on both sides. At the time when the gravel was accumulating there must have been a considerable set of the current against this part of the shore ; and this set must have diminished"], [151, "111 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. before the silt and mud could accumulate on both sides ; so that, from Hurst castle eastward there is now little action of the water upon any part of the mainland of Hampshire ; the changes which take place are only deposits of materials brought by the water ; and, until one comes to Portsmouth, these are very slow in their progress, and steady in their positions. The bank which abuts upon the tidal beach to the eastward of Calshot, extends in a triangular form a good way into the Channel, and the middle of it forms a sort of low ridge, upon some parts of which there is only half a fathom depth. Opposite to Calshot the bank on the northern side also extends a considerable way, about a mile from the high-water mark in some places, and this is also the greatest breadth of the Calshot bank directly parallel to the former. On this bank there is not more than a fathom and a half of water in some places, and in general there are only two. The clear channel opposite Calshot, where it is narrowest, is about half-a-mile across. The north bank extends nearly eight miles from westward to eastward, terminating or rather becoming very narrow opposite Fort Monkton. At the point where the coast trends north-eastward to Blockhouse fort, at the western entrance of Portsmouth harbour, and between these \u2014 the distance between them is about two miles, the bank known by the name of the Spit, extends south-eastward at least a mile and a quarter from the land. The depth of water from the shore, on the middle of the bank, shoals outward, from a foot to two fathoms, and this extends nearly a mile and a half, beyond which there is still a continuation of the bank, the depth of water upon which varies from three fathoms to four. The roadstead or anchorage of Spit head lies immediately to the south-west of the Spit, and there there is a depth of water varying from five to fifteen fathoms. From the extremity of the Spit to Ryde sand on the opposite side, there are about two miles of this deep anchorage. While the entrance on the south-east, between Ryde sand and the shifting sand-bank of the Dean, which extends off the coast, from the entrance of Portsmouth har-"], [152, "112 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. bour eastward, and stretches at least three miles into the sea, from the entrance of Langstone harbour, is not above one mile across, and the edges of it, and of the bank on the Isle of Wight shore, have not more than a fathom and a half or two fathoms of water. These banks restrain the vio lence of the current, and also of the ground-swell which rolls round the eastern coast of the Isle of Wight, and by this means contribute to the tranquillity and safety of the Spithead anchorage. The eastern bank, or bank of shifting sand, which consists in great part of disintegrated matters from the tertiary and fresh-water formations of the Isle of Wight, though it chokes up the entrance to Langstone har bour and also to that of Chichester, is a considerable protec tion to the harbour of Portsmouth, by preventing the circu lar current, which would return strongly upon it from the curved shore westward of the bill of Selsea, were it not for the comparatively small depth of water upon this intervening bank. Indeed, it is the contention between this current, which, setting round the Isle of Wight, as has been men tioned, is turned by the western side of Selsea bill, and the current which comes by the Needles, and along the deep channel on the north side of the Isle of Wight, that the bank in question keeps so continually shifting. Both cur rents, where they sweep along the shore in their strength, carry the shingle eastward ; but as the current from round the east of the island is a dropped portion of the general current, and that which comes by the Needles is weakened by the expansion after clearing the narrow passage at Hurst castle, both of them bring sand, rather than gravel to the bank which lies between Portsmouth and the bill of Selsea, and also to the banks on the north-east of the Isle of Wight. The banks which we have now mentioned, prevent any farther inroad of the sea upon the south coast of Hampshire eastward of Hurst castle, or upon the eastern part of the north coast of the Isle of Wight. On the contrary, the sea is in a state of recession, and the navigable parts of the"], [153, "113 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. creeks are aelvancing more to seaward ; so that, with no very great expense of embankment, more breadth of land might be gained to the county within the narrow seas, than there is lost on the shore to the westward of Hurst castle, and on the west and back of the Isle of Wight. The land which is accumulating, and which might be added to the productive surface of the county, would also, if reclaimed, be of better quality, and far more appropriate, either for the plough or for pasturage, than that which the sea is wearing away. With proper management, there would also be a much greater breaelth of it. It is, for very obvious physical reasons, always upon the high cliffs or bold shores that the sea commits its depredations ; and, allowing for the pebbles which, in the Channel, are carried progressively eastward, one acre of the high cliff would, upon shores so shallow, as many of those in question are, afford ten acres of salt-marsh, fit for the pasturage of cattle. Whether the quality of what land might be acquired by embanking the mud-beaches on these parts of the coast of Hampshire would equal Romney marsh in fertility may be doubted, but there are at least some of the elements of a fertile soil, and the climate is certainly better than that to the eastward of Beachy head. There is, indeed, one obstacle to the improvement of those beaches : there would be little advantage obtained from \" warping,\" which is found so advantageous upon the floodable lands along the estuaries of the midland rivers. From the quantity of lime in the tidal beaches, there is not the same abundance of small marine animals as in the mid land estuaries ; and, partly from the nature of the soil, partly from the filtration of the river water through the grass of the irrigated meadows, that water runs much more limpid to the sea than in any other part of the kingdom. These obstacles might all be got the better of, however, \u2014 at least to a very considerable extent; and thus, the embankment of some portions of the shallow beaches in this part of Hampshire may probably be accounted among the most valuable improvements, upon a large scale, of which VOL. II. Q"], [154, "114 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. the district is susceptible. We have an encouragement to this in what has been done by nature herself on some parts of the coast, especially in the island of Portsea. That island has been, in great part at least, recovered by the action of nature, with very little assistance of human art ; and the products of it, especially some of the more choice kinds of culinary vegetables, are unrivalled by those of any other part of the kingdom. Whether it would be altogether judicious to embank any considerable breadth of such a place as Portsmouth harbour, or such of that as is rendered very shallow by mud and silt, is a question that would admit of discussion, as there are many arguments that might be plausibly adduced on both sides of it. There is no doubt that the ebb, setting out of the harbour, comes in contact with the progressive current, or tidal wave along the shore, and thus tends to form a natu ral embankment between the inland basin and the sea ; and that this embankment has a tendency to approach on both sides and form a bar, in the same manner as a bar is formeel at the seaward end of all the narrow estuaries on the east coast ; and there is probably, at least in the present state of the waters in the narrow seas of this part of Hampshire, a greater power at work for the formation of bars, than there is in the estuaries on the east coast, with the exception of such of these as have extensive beaches of sand or gravel to the north \u2014 the direction from which the tidal wave comes ; as is the case at the mouths of the Dee, the Esk, the Tay, and the Tyne. The bank to the eastward of the entrance of Portsmouth harbour is shifting sand, and much sand must also be carried eastward, from that part of the fresh-water formation portion of the Isle of Wight which is now in the progress of demolition. There is thus, danger that both the flood and the ebb would tend to form a bar across the entrance of Portsmouth harbour, which bar would very soon obstruct the passage of vessels requiring much draught of water, if the dimensions of the harbour \u2014 which acts as a scouring basin, were to be much diminished. Even with"], [155, "115 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. the present extent of the harbour, which is very large as compared with the width of the entrance, there is a bar at Portsmouth, extending obliquely north-eastward, in the en trance from about the midelle of the Spit, quite across, not to the opposite bank, but in the direction of the southern part of the town ; and upon this bar there are only two fathoms at low-water now, while outward, between -.he Spit and the eastern bank, there are from eleven to four ; and within, there are not less than four in any place, until the channels are ascended to above Portsea town. In a future chapter, or section of a chapter, we shall have to give a more minute account of the great natural harbour of Portsmouth ; but this much is necessary in considering the general action of the sea upon that part of the Hampshire coast of which Portsmouth is now one of the most interesting spots. It has been asserted, by those who are intimately acquainted with them atter, that the bar across the entrance to Portsmouth harbour is increasing, so that first-rate ships have now to be relieved of the weight of their guns before they can enter or leave the harbour. This is an important fact ; and it becomes the more so, when we look at the harbours to the eastward, Langstone and Chichester. These are both of as ample dimensions as Portsmouth harbour, and the entrances to them are as narrow, so that the efficiency of the ebb-tide in scouring their entrances should be as great. This, however, is not the case ; and that it is not, is evidently owing to the bank, which, with variable, but always considerable breadth, abuts upon the shore the whole way from Portsmouth to Selsea bill ; and there appears to be considerable danger that this bank may, in time, advance so far to the westward as to place the harbour of Portsmouth in the same condition as those of Langstone and Chichester. Should this be the case, the present harbour must be silted up ; and then the only good harbour which will be left on the mainland side of the narrow seas, will be that of Southampton, which appears to be safe from any invasion of this sand-bank; nei ther is there much danger that the deposit of chalky and q 2"], [156, "116 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. gravelly matters, which now forms the banks in the South ampton Water, will increase much, at least for a long time to come. The way in which the different deposits in the narrow seas upon this part of the Hampshire coast are formed, is a matter well worthy of minute investigation ; but it is a mat ter involving some difficulties, and one upon which the limits within which we are confined will not allow us fully to enter. We may, however, very briefly notice the several places and states of the water, where and by which the different parts of the disintegrated sand are deposited, as this will form a basis of investigation to those who feel disposed to enter into a more minute enquiry than we can afford upon this highly interesting. branch of what maybe called \"progressive Geo logy.\" The pebbles, whether they come from the disintegra tion of the Isle of Wight and of the mainland coast of Hants to the westward of Hurst castle, or from places still farther to the west, are borne along by the force and violence of the current acting upon the beach or bottom along which the said pebbles are rolled. No pebble of any size, of whatever kind of rock it may be composed, can be suspended in the water, so as to be moved by that, without assistance from the beach or the bottom as a fulcrum or point dappui. There fore the pebbles, or the shingle as their aggregate is called, invariable move eastward with the main set of the tidal wave and the prevailing current of the wind ; and although they are piled up against the western sides of the jutting points, and against those parts of the shore to which the tide sets directly inwards, yet they are never brought back again to the west, even by those eddies into which the dropped or second high-water tide sets with the greatest force. Thus, wherever the pebbles accumulate, we may be sure that the main or eastward current of the tidal wave sets against the shore with the greatest force; and that, therefore, the shingly beaches, which are thus formed, are places of great danger to shipping. Their march along the shore is often very pecu liar. They do not obey the motion of the water, as if they"], [157, "117 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. were floatable things that could be borne upon the current ; but, on the contrary, they always move per saltum, or by leaps of some length or other. They make their way eastward by traverses, that is, they are dashed toward the lanel at short lengths, and again borne seaward by the retreat of the wave, only both of these parts of the step are performed in oblique lines, so that the pebble gets farther to the eastward every time that it approaches the land. Where the tidal wave sweeps directly along-shore, they are not allowed to rest, or even to make their appearance on the beach; but they have a tendency to accumulate on the windward sides of projecting points, and to form ridges, behind which, that is, between them and the land, there are often hollows, as may be seen at Chesil bank, at Freshwater bay, at New Shoreham, at Dover, and at various other places. Freshwater bay affords, within a very short distance, a good illustration of the wearing away of the bold cliffs, and the accumulation of shingle in the low shores of the ex posed bay. The shingly pebbles are the materials which assist the breaking surges in battering the cliffs ; but they do not rest at the places where they perform this labour. Where they remain permanently, there must always be some confluence of the currents of the water, \u2014 an opposing action to that which brings them, and not the merely passive re sistance of the land ; and if one examine the Channel shores with attention, and at the same time bear in mind the gene ral direction of the currents, one can, with tolerable cer tainty, lay one's finger upon those parts of the line on the map at which the shingle accumulates. Dover may at first sight appear an anamoly, as the trend of the shore there, more resembles the bays where sand accumulates, than the places where shingle piles up. But the opposition made by the tide from the north, occasions a confluence of currents at Dover, of the same kind as that which throws up the shingle-banks farther to the westward, only it is more power ful ; and, in consequence of this, the accumulation is more abundant, and the pebbles more constantly in motion. When"], [158, "118 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. the South Foreland is passed, and the north tide begins to be the prevailing one, the pebbles begin to be mixed with more and more of sand, and soon pass into beaches wholly of that material, and having a much longer escarpment, for the same height of bank, than the loose and rolling shingle. Sand may be considered as an accumulation of smaller pebbles, which have just as little adhesion to each other as the larger pebbles of the shingle. They are more floatable than the large pebbles, but less so than the particles of chalk, and clay, and mud, any of which forms an adhesive paste with water ; and therefore the accumulations of sand are formed in places intermediate between the shingly beaches and the muelely banks \u2014 places where there is less action of the water than where the former are piled up, and more than where the latter are accumulated. But, before we refer to the points of sandy deposit, it may not be amiss to hint at the mechanical cause why matters, which are all very nearly of the same specific gravity, should be deposited in places where the action of the water is so different; and we do this the more readily, that it is a subject which, though very interesting to all who examine and study the shores, whether for information or for purposes of practical utility, is not often stated. From the law of surface action, it is the fact of its surface being wettable, which enables the water to bring to shore a substance specifically heavier than the water itself. Hence, the power of the water to move a pebble, a grain of sand, a particle of chalk, or clay, or any other substance, is always in proportion to the surface of that substance. This is the motive force, or the force which carries the substance along. The antagonist force, or that which causes the substance to be dropped or deposited, is the weight of the substance itself; and therefore, the ten dency of the substance to separate from the water, by re sisting and overcoming the motion of the water, must be the ratio which the weight bears to the surface. Now, sup pose two substances of the same shape and specific gravity, the weight will bear a greater proportion to the surface in"], [159, "119 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. the larger one than in the smaller ; for the surfaces increase only as the squares of the same dimension, while the masses, and consequently also the weights, increase as the cubes. Thus, if there are three portions of the same kind of stone, no matter what kind it is, the one with a diameter of 2, the second with 4, and the third with 8, the power of the water to move these will be expressed by the squares of the diameters, that is, by 4, 16, and 64, while the resistance to being moved will be expressed by the cubes of the same, that is, by 16, 64, and 512. But though these are the ra tios, yet the differences, after the tendencies to be carried are subtracted, are the real inertias by which the portions of matter are actually stopped. If 4, 16, and 64, are re spectively subtracted from 16, 64, and 512, the remainders are 12, 48, and 448 ; or, dividing each of these numbers by 4, which does not alter the proportion, the results are 3, 12, and 112. Therefore, the tendencies of pebbles, sand, and other matters to separate from water, and remain at rest at the bottom, increase as the difference of the cubes and the squares of their lineal dimensions ; and, consequently, the forces necessary to move them must also be in the same ratio. Thus, for instance, if a grain of sand is one-tenth of an inch in diameter, and a pebble four inches, it will take 62,400 times as much force of the water to move the pebble, as to move the grain of sand. But the finer particles of chalk and clay, which are formed out of the disintegrated cliffs on the coast of the Channel, are probably not more than one-hundredth part of an inch in diameter ; and, therefore, each of them can be floated and moved by a very small fraction of the force, or current of the water, which is re quired to move a pebble four inches in diameter, or only one nine-hundredth part of that which is necessary to float and move the particle of sand. The truth of this principle is as obvious as the principle itself is simple ; and it serves at once to explain why we find the pebbles of shingle, the grains of sand, and the par ticles of chalk, clay, and other matters usually expressed by"], [160, "120 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. the general term \" mud,\" deposited in so many different situ ations, and often so far from each other, upon the Channel shores, even when, in all probability, the whole of them have been derived from the simultaneous destruction of the same identical cliff. The shingle, which requires a force of the wa ter so much more powerful than either of the others, passes behind the Isle of Wight; or-the portions of it which are disintegrated from the cliffs between the Needles and Cliff's end point, are strewn along the bottom immediately to the eastward, in angular fragments, which evince no severe action of the water. The sands are accumulated partially in San down bay, between Dunnose and Culver cliff, but in greater portion in the great sand-bank that lies to the eastward of the entrance to Portsmouth harbour ; and from this, eastward, there is little resting place for sand, until it gets northward of the South Foreland. The lighter matters are thrown into the places of more gentle current, and the deposits of them are brought by the return-current westward, which never moves the pebbles, and rarely, if ever, the sand, un less it is a portion of the eastward current, which has been returned by the peculiar trend of the line of coast. These different tendencies of the three leading descrip tions of the disintegrated cliffs to move to different localities, in the ratios of their masses, afford us a foundation by which we are in so far enabled to judge of what shall be the fu ture progress of the banks and obstacles to navigation at the places where they accumulate. At Dover, where the shingle is carried in such quantity, there can be no perma nent entrance to the harbour, by any projecting piers, the construction of which is within the range of ordinary ex pense ; and, in consequence of this, the navigation there will become gradually more and more hazardous. It is probable also, that the bar at Portsmouth will continue increasing from additional deposits on the Spit to the west, and the sand-bank to the east; and it is not easy to see how this can be obviated, except by very inefficient means. To the westward of Portsmouth, in the Southampton Water, and in"], [161, "121 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. the Solent, there is little to be apprehended from sand-banks, or from bars across the main channels, though experience shows that accumulations will continue to be gathered, both upon the shores and upon the banks, where the slack water is formed by the currents of tide, to and from the Southamp- ton Water, meeting those along the coast of the Isle of Wight. Still, however, there is obviously enough of fresh- water brought into the Southampton Water by the Test and the Itchen, even in their orelinary states, to keep the ship- channel clear, and to prevent any considerable shallowing of the anchorage off Southampton. Of river deposit in this part of the narrow seas there may now be said to be none ; for, as has been already hinted, the waters of both the rivers, and of every branch, and almost every brook that empties itself into them, pass through a continuous filter of grass, from the very remotest point of which a small speck of wa- ter-meadow can be obtained. Thus, whether during the dry season, or during rains, both of these rivers run trans- parent to the sea ; and do not carry down as much earthy matter in twelve months, as some brooks, in districts of other formation and different management, do in a single flood. Nor is this all ; for the water-meadows, over which the waters are led in so many mains and trenches, and so frequently spread out in breadth, have all the effect which regulating lakes produce upon the floods that pass through them. This effect, in keeping the lower river comparatively pure, and uniform in its depth Of water, is very striking, as may be seen in many parts of the Scotch Highlands, where the brawling streams, which discharge their waters into a large lake, may be seen bringing down hill-sides of sand and gravel during every fall of rain, which falls are, in some parts of the Highlands, very heavy and vei-y frequent, and foaming and chafing, and overturning trees, rending away rocks, rolling vast masses of stone along, and burying the meadow in the spoils of the mountain ; meanwhile the river which flows from the lake is as pure in its water, and as gentle in its current, with as little perceptible increase VOL. II. R"], [162, "122 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. of its volume, as though no drop of rain had fallen, and no disruption of the soil had taken place in the upper country. The water-meadows, over which the brooks and rivers of southern Hampshire are distributed in breadth, perform this office even more completely than it could be performed by any lake, or indeed by any succession of lakes. Lakes do not act as filters, they merely give the water pause, so that it may precipitate the earthy matters with which it is charged ; and, even when the lake is of sufficient magnitude to allow of a complete precipitation, it does not prevent the water flood from robbing the land, by transferring the lighter and more fertile particles of it into the lake, where they are a long time before forming a bank large and compact enough for being of any service. The water-meadows, on the other hand, turn the river into a lake, in all its ramifications, while the herbage on them lays hold of every particle of light and fertile matter which the brooks and rain-streams bring in, and do not allow one square foot to be spoiled by gravel, or even a single pebble to be rolled. Thus, while this method of turning the water to account on the meadows, converts these into the most productive and valuable spots in the whole county, it equally secures the channels from being choked up by alluvial matters, and the land from being wasted by the transfer of its most valuable particles to the sea. They who projected, \u2014 who carried into execution, the very ingenious and rather costly systems of mains and branches by which the irrigation is obtained, had of course no object in view, save their own profit, in the construction of these works. But this is one of the many in stances in which men, by pursuing their own interest in the best and most skilful manner, equally promote the benefit of others, and do far more good than they intend. If the rivers had been left in single channels and without the grassy surface of those meadows, there is no doubt they would have produced the same havoc along their courses, and carried the same burdens of matter, to be thrown back by the sea in bars at their mouths, as is done by other ri-"], [163, "123 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. vers which flow in similar valleys, ancL along single chan nels, and without any meadows to retard or filter the water. The Itchen, taken on its natural level, is by no means a slow running river ; and any one who examines the shape of its banks will readily perceive that, at -some former pe riod, it has shifted its channel, cutting first in one place and then in another, and rolling considerable quantities of gravel to the sea. The Test is even more rapid, and were its waters to flow in a natural channel of their own formation, or rather had they always so flown, there is no question that its floods would have lorded it over the whole bottom of the valley, and rendered that unavailing for any useful purpose either of tillage or of pasture. In many other parts of Britain, we find rivers, flowing along valleys similarly formed to that of the Test, and not receiving the rains of a greater breadth of surface, which are yet, always when a flood comes, demolishing the banks at one place, scattering the gravel over another, and washing away to the sea, all the matters really conducive to fertility. Nor is this all ; for, during the rains of autumn, those rivers get so swollen by the floods, that they bear away the produce of the meadows, and but too frequently, the cattle, the habitations, and even the people. The water-meadows prevent all these elisasters, add greatly to the wealth and prosperity of the districts in which they exist, and at the same time conserve the water for the purposes of navigation. These considerations of the water-meadows are absolutely necessary to a right appreciation of those circumstances upon which the permanence of the Southampton navigation depends. They establish the fact, that there is little or no silting up of any one place to be apprehended from any ac tion of the land-floods ; but that all the deposit which is left anywhere within Calshot castle must be brought by the in flux of the tidal water ; and, where there is only a single action of the water, \u2014 a single current bringing a load of mat ter, whatever may be deposited on the shores, there is never any tendency to form a bar in the mid-channel. The banks r 2"], [164, "124 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. which lie to the eastward of Calshot, do not militate against this, because, at the places where they are deposited, there is the same conflict of currents, \u2014 the one checking the mo tion of the other, as there is where the Godwin sands are formed off the Downs, and the various banks are dropped in the great tidal eddies of the British ocean. Such are a few of the circumstances connected with the action of the waters within the narrow seas of Hampshire, and with the only anticipation which we can philosophically have, of what shall be the future state of those seas. The destruction of the land exposed to the main current is pro bably as great now as it has been at any former period ; and thus, as the banks in advance of Selsea bill, and be tween it and the entrance to Portsmouth, continue to in crease, they may invade the entrance to Portsmouth har bour, just as they have already invaded the entrances to the harbours of Chichester and Langston ; but still, there is not the least apprehension that, except in the case of some grand and unlooked for convulsion of nature, the narrow seas, between the mainland and the Isle of Wight, will ever be without a safe and commodious harbour."], [165, "125 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS. CHAPTER V. PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. Having devoted the principal part of the chapter immedi ately preceding to the relations between sea and land on the southern parts of Hampshire and some of the adjoining coasts, we deem it more conducive, both to method and to clearness, to treat of the physical characters of that portion of the county which lies between the southern elevation of the chalk ridge on the north, and the sea, from the entrance of Chichester harbour to Netley abbey, on the south, in a separate chapter. Physically considered, this is a very complicated district, and one with which it is exceedingly difficult to deal in such a manner as to be intelligible. Its climate, indeed, is pretty uniform, though not absolutely so, inasmuch as the surrounding and adjacent lands do not equally cover it from all winds. The high downs to the south of Petersfield, protect it completely from the influence of the cold north east ; and the continuation of those downs, until the water shed at Longwood warren, and even close to the Itchen in Twyford down, equally protect it from the north and north west. To the southward of the western termination of these, the ground upon the water-shed is low, though not a per fect level ; but where the ground between the Itchen and"], [166, "126 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF the most westerly river in this natural district is lowest, that is, between Bishop's Waltham and Botley, there are high grounds immediately on the west of the Itchen, which form a natural barrier in that direction. Thus it may be said, that, along the north-east, the north, and the west, this southern slope of Hampshire is physically sheltered from the winds of distant districts ; and, in a great measure, confined to the local action or transfer of the atmosphere, between sea and land. On the south-west again, it is protected from the violence of the sea air, by the land of the New Forest district, and the Isle of Wight, which latter protects it in great part from the south. Thus, the south-east is the only wind which can come full upon it without any obstacle from ground more elevated than the lower parts of the district. The wind in this, the only open direction, is a sea wind in appearance ; but it is not in reality one of those sea winds which waft saline particles far inland, and thereby injure vegetation. This wind from the south-east, or from the south to nearly the east, blows across the Channel from the coast of France, which coast, taking Portsmouth as a centre, forms an irregular arc, the mean radius of which does not exceed one hundred miles. This is a short passage for a breeze of any considerable velocity ; and when the wind is strong, though the passage over this inconsiderable extent of water may temper it, it can never waft any injurious mat ters, or acquire that destructive velocity which gales do ac quire when they sweep over many hundred miles of sea. There is another circumstance connected with the only winds which can reach this part of Hampshire from the open Channel ; and that is the fact that the wind comes across the main set of the tidal wave. Therefore, this, the only sea wind which can reach the southern slope of Hamp shire is, in so far as respects vegetation, fertility, and salu brity, one of the most gentle winds that can blow. It is no doubt fresh, as all winds that come over the sea are ; but it is never raw and cold, neither does it exert the same dry and withering influence, as the sea winds from the east but too"], [167, "127 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. often do upon the east coast of England, and of Britain generally. The sea wind here is literally \"the soft south,\" one of the most balmy that can blow, and well deserving of all the encomiums which have been bestowed upon it. Hence, blight is unknown in this part of Hampshire \u2014 at least that description which is produced by the cold and dry ing winds of the early season ; which winds wither the leaves, render the juices of plants stagnant and saccharine, and thus favour the hatching of innumerable caterpillars, which con sume all that the wind has left, and thus render the trees, especially the fruit trees, both unsightly and unproductive. There is another advantageous effect of this wind : from the quantity of water in the three lanel-locked bays or harbours of Chichester, Langston, and Portsmouth, and from the spongy nature of much of the soil of Hayling and Portsea islands, of which much of the immediate substratum is of the nature of peat, the air would be very unwholesome, were it not that this softest and most salutary of sea breezes is occasionally let in upon it. If, too, the quantity of silted bottom, which is laid bare at low water, were acted upon only by a fresh-water flood, it would give a pestilent mias mata which would be very injurious to the health of its in habitants, and even impart an unwholesome quality to the vegetable products of the earth, which proelucts are never of the safest or most pleasant kind, if the air in which they are grown is in any way tainted. The sea breeze, and the evaporation of the sea water, combine in giving the air an anteseptic quality, which completely destroys all miasmata ; and in consequence of this, the low and marshy grounds about Portsmouth and the other places adjacent, are as healthy as if they were dry and elevated, at the same time that they are much more proeluctive. As if to render these advantages of exposure to the pecu liar winds of the sea on this part of the coast in the highest degree serviceable, both to animal and to vegetable life, the small portion of the district, which lies immediately between and adjoining the three harbours, has a provision in the"], [168, "128 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF power of the surface which gives it an atmospheric action of its own, independent of that of the district, to say nothing of the rest of the county. This is the peculiarly detached ridge of chalk, known by the name of Portsdown, or Ports down hill. This singular elevation is, in the surface strata at least, completely detached from the rest of the chalk by a bed of tertiary matters, several miles in breadth, and con taining the remains of the forest of Bere. The down stretches in the direction of almost due east and west from Bedhampton, at the most northerly point of Langston har bour, to the town of Fareham, at the north-western extremity of the harbour at Portsmouth. For great part of its length its base is not above a mile or a mile and a half in breadth ; but it gets a little broader toward the western extremity, and subsides gradually, till the chalk gets under the tertiary for mation north-east of Fareham. It stands up like an unbro ken ridge or wall for a distance of about six miles, and hav ing a general elevation of about four hundred feet. Its sum mit is not more than a mile from the northern part of either ofthe two harbours ; and as the southern side is steep, and the descent to a very slight elevation above the level of the tide short, it has a conspicuous and rather a singular appearance, \u2014 very much that of an artificial mound raised to defend' the town of Portsmouth, the ships in the harbour, and all the parts immediately adjacent, from the fury of the north wind. The district to the north of Portsmouth, between it and the main ridge of the chalk, is obviously a partial basin or depres sion ; but whether it was occasioned by the upheaving of the down, or by the depression of that part of the chalk upon which it immediately rests, is a point which it is not neces sary, neither would it be easy, to determine. There is evi dence, however, that the down has been elevated, or the basin depressed ; for the strata of chalk, as indicated by the flints and other evidences of gradual depositation, dip toward the north, that is, toward the basin of the forest. To the south of the down, chalk forms the substratum, though under a considerable depth of tertiary and alluvial"], [169, "129 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. matters ; and it is highly probable that it continues to do so until it crops out in the hummocky ridge which tra verses the Isle of Wight. The chalk is worked lor lime very near the bottom of Portsmouth harbour, and it appears in the bottom of the harbour itself, not far to the south of the ruins of Porchester castle. This singular ridge of chalk is of course, very dry, and is highly susceptible to the action of the sun, as well as ra- pidly cooled when that action ceases. The consequence is, that the air over Portsmouth and the aeljacent parts never can stagnate for any long period. The sea and the down are never of the same temperature for any length of time ; and there are cases in which a land wind from the down, and a sea wind from the water, are blended together to form the Portsmouth atmosphere, when the low ground upon which the town stands becomes more heated than either the down or the sea. This must conduce much to the salubrity of the air, and also to the growth of vegeta- bles, which would be apt to become stunted if their change of air came from the sea only, soft as is the sea air upon this part of the coast. The summit of the down is not more than six miles from Gilkicker point, on the west of the entrance to Portsmouth harbour, nor more than five miles from Southsea castle, or more than four anel a half from Cumberlanel fort on the west of the entrance to Langston. Thus, of the square of six miles in the side, extending from the ridge of the down southward, more than half the area is water, at least at full tide ; and the influence of the down and the sea, acting reci- procally upon each other, is felt over all the combination of land and water to the east ofthe county, and in the adjoin- ing part of Sussex, as far as Chichester on the east, and Selsea bill on the south-east, indeed over all the lowland eastward, until the ridge of the south downs comes in and supplies the same kind of antagonist to the sea, as Ports- down does to the little spot of Hampshire under considera- tion. The whole of this stripe of lowland has, accordingly, a climate well adapted for every species of vegetable which vol. ii. s"], [170, "130 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF requires warmth and shelter ; and we believe that upon it a failure of the crop is very rarely known. At Emsworth, which is on the border of the county, and almost in a line with the length of Portsdown, the main ridge of the south downs is at the distance of nine miles north from the high est point of the tide ; and irregular spurs of the downs, and sometimes detached hills of chalk, extend southward, of vari able lengths, but in general nearly to half the distance. In Sussex, there is a spur of the clowns branching southward from Beacon hill in the main ridge, and about three miles east of the point at which the boundary of Hants and Sus sex crosses the ridge. This spur, which is, like Portsdown, a narrow elevation, approaches within six miles of the east ern extremity of Portsdown ; and the direction of the two would lead one to suppose that they are parts of the margin of one depression or basin of the chalk ; but, as the surface appears, the separation is now complete, although the gene ral inclination of the surface against the opening would lead to the supposition that a strong current of water had set southward through this opening, while another set westward between the main ridge and Portsdown. Thus, we have the eastern part of the forest of Bere, or of the ground which that forest once occupied, inclining southward toward Ems worth channel, and Langston harbour; while the portion westward of this, slopes to the west in a direction nearly parallel to the down. The few brooks which fall into the harbours here, all have their rise in the elevated parts of the forest ; and, though near their sources the soil consists of cold clay or sand, it becomes better as the shore is approached. Many parts of the colder land are well wooded ; the surface is in many places varied ; and when the combination of woodland and glade, and hill and dale, is seen with the water and islands beyond, the landscape is a very pleasing one: as the high downs are approached, timber becomes scanty, there is little of the surface under culture, and habi tations are few and far between. The downs are, it is true, in great part cleft in twain to the eastward of Butser hill,"], [171, "131 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. where the London road from Portsmouth passes ; but for more than four miles along that road, that is, from Horndean to the summit of the ridge, the country is very bleak and naked. It consists mainly of Charlton down, Hole down, and the hill to the westward of the road, opposite Butser. All of these downs are very naked, and the summits of them covered by a scanty crop of alpine grasses, with here and there a bush of ground juniper, not larger than a sheep, tell how inclement the winter must be upon them. But still, though the winter air is keen, the climate is good, and there is no question that planting, were it skilfully put in prac tise, would tend very materially to the amelioration of the climate, upon even the most exposed, and presently barren, of those chalky heights. This may be inferred from the fact, that wherever a sheltered spot occurs there is a kindly sward upon it, and nature herself has sowed thriving copses in several of the dells. The summit-level along the forest of Bere, may be re- garded as extending northward from Portsdown, not far from where the London road passes, till it reaches Butser hill, which is a kind of nucleus of all the elevations in the central part of this natural division of the county. Rivers in this part there may be said to be none ; and the brooks are few, nameless, and insignificant. The central and most elevated part of this forest is, upon the average, about three miles to the north of Portsdown ; but it trends more to the north in the western part. Between it and the down, there is a kind of valley or depression, along which the main stream, which is a very trifling one, flows with a winding course past the village of Southwick, where it receives a branch from the north. A few miles further west, the united rivu- let runs towards the south, and falls into Portsmouth har- bour at Fareham. This is the only stream which falls into the harbour ; and its quantity of water is so trifling that it could have no effect one way or another ; so that whatever natural changes the harbour undergoes must depend entirely upon the sea. s 2"], [172, "132 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF The soil of this space between the down and the forest, consists of strong clay, or barren sand, or an admixture of the two ; and these alternate with each other, at very short distances, sometimes in the same field, the two ends of which would require very different modes of culture. The general surface here might be described as flat and destitute of beauty. It is also cold from the nature of the soil, and the interception of the sea air by the high down on the south. The cross paths are very heavy in wet weather, and in the winter months the climate is uncomfortable. To the northward of the forest, between that and the northward downs, there is another valley, or rather plain, consisting of clayey or sandy lands, which crop out upon the chalk toward the north. In character and climate this very much resembles the former, only it is elestitute of even a brook, and in great part naked of timber. As might be expected, parish churches, and the seats of landowners are not numerous in this part of Hampshire ; and, though it has of late years received a good deal of improvement, es pecially by the enclosure and cultivation of surfaces which once belonged to the forest, physically speaking, it is far from being the best part of the county. To the north and west of the districts now mentioned there is a district of superior character, at least in so far as nature is concerned. This district consists of the valley of a river wdiich has been sometimes called the Arle, though, like very many of the rivers of Hampshire, it locally gets different names, as it passes by different places, each village having a nomencla ture of its own, or designating it by the general name of the Bourne. After the Test and the Itchen, this is the largest river rising in Hampshire, and having its whole course within the county. The first sources of it are in the north ern side of a high and bleak range of the downs, which, com mencing at Butser hill on the east, trends in a curve south ward by Oxenbourn down and Chidden down, a distance of about five miles, to old Winchester hill, at which it divides into two parts, one trending northward in the direction of"], [173, "133 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. Warnford, a distance of about two miles, and the other west ward by Stoke dowrn to Meon Stoke, about a mile and a half. Both branches terminate abruptly at these places, and the river alluded to passes across their terminations. Taking the curve of the downs, from Butser hill to Warnford, or rather to the spur Avhieh comes down to West Meon, about a mile and a half north-east of Warnford, the downs form a curve convex to the north with diversities of hill and dale filling up the convexity. Between these downs and those which extend from Longwood warren and by Gander and Kilmeston downs, and so on to the southward of the road from Winchester to Petersfield, and round by Barrow hill to Butser hill, there is enclosed the valley of Meon or East Meon, a very beautiful spot, nearly encircled by the chalky downs, but containing strong clay, rich loam, anel other soils well suited for agricultural purposes. This valley of Meon, is the upper part of the valley of that river, of which we speak, and it is perhaps the portion of it which can with most propriety be denominated a valley. The original streams of the river, of which there are seve ral, though none of them are large, have their sources chiefly in or under the high downs on the south ; and their united streams flow onward north-westerly and westerly to West Meon, south-west to Warnford, and then westerly of south to the sea, at a point about two miles and a half east of Cal shot castle. In its course from Warnford, this river passes a number of parish churches, which shows that, in the early times, this part of the county was valuable. These parishes will be more particularly noticed afterwards ; but, in the mean time, it may not be amiss to give a list of them. The first is Exton, nearly two miles south of Warnford ; the next Corhampton, half-a-mile from Exton ; then Meon Stoke, half-a-mile from Corhampton ; Droxford, a mile and a quar ter from Meon Stoke, and Soberton, not quite a mile from Droxford. The number of churches which occur here, namely six, within the short elistance of four miles, on the straight line, and very little more by the course of the river,"], [174, "134 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF affords more conclusive evidence than any description, both of the fertility of the soil and the salubrity of the climate. All these churches were established at a very early period ; and though the professed object in the founding of churches always is the good of the people, yet they are, of course, never established but where there are people to enjoy the benefit of religious instruction, and by implication, if not by primary perception, the means of affording carnal necessa ries to the men who minister in holy things. From Soberton to the mouth of the river, the distance is nearly eleven miles, or not very much less than three times the former ; and this, of the same quality and population with the four miles above, would have given eighteen churches, or at any rate seventeen ; but there are, in reality, only two, \u2014 Wickham, about four miles below Soberton, and Titchfield, about other four miles further down. Whatever the country may be now, in consequence of modern improve ment, this disparity in the number of churches, tells, more plainly than any language, what difference there must be in the natural or physical circumstances of the country on the two portions of the river. The fact is, that a little below Soberton, the district of rich clay and loam, which begins in the valley of Meon, and skirts the chalky downs in an irregular line, by Bishop's Waltham to the valley of the Itchen, is cut off by a continuation of the sandy and origi nally sterile ground of which the forest of Bere forms the eastern part. This description of ground, susceptible of im provement in many parts, but naturally sterile, or producing heath in some places, and dwarfed and stunted trees in others, occupies a considerable portion of the seaward part of this natural district of Hampshire, crossing the valley of the Itchen, or at all events, rising to even a greater elevation on the west, or right-hand side of that river, than it does any where to the eastward ; exteneling in large patches northward to the left of the Test, and occupying no inconsiderable por tion of the New Forest. Wherever this portion of the ter tiary formation makes its appearance, it approximates the"], [175, "135 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. nature of those hungry sands and gravels usually termed crag ; and, as is the case with them, it presents a very dreary and barren appearance when left in a state of nature. But,' though a hungry subsoil, and one which is, for a time at least, costly in the article of manure, there are some circum stances connected with it which are by no means unfavour able to agriculture. The surface of it never sours by stag nant water ; but, on the contrary, it is dry, warm, and early \u2022 and there is scarcely any objection to it other than the great expense of first bringing it into a state fit for bearing crops. With proper management, although that management would be costly, the more elevated portions of this description of natural soil would make good turnip land, while the lower ones would answer equally well for potatoes. Both pota toes and turnips were unknown to cultivation in the early times, and the same may be said of the artificial grasses, which have been introduced with so much advantage. But, as the ancient cultivators were ignorant of all these, they had no alternative but to abandon such grounds to what ever wild plants they would bear in a state of nature, and whatever wild animals chose to resort to them. Deer were the only large animals to which they are suited ; and this, and also the caprice of the old monarchs \u2014 who we sup pose were naturally as wise as the monarchs of modern times, led to the afforesting of lands on the green sand, and those sandy portions of the tertiary formation, of which there used to be so many examples in Hampshire, \u2014 as for instance, that of Holt, and Woolmer forest, in the eastern part of the county ; and the forest of Bere, Waltham chase, and the New Forest in the southern part. In the central part of this district those sandy heights now appear in detached patches only, though there is little doubt that, at one period, they occupied a considerable portion of the surface near the sea. They are not of a character very materially to affect the atmosphere which passes over them ; and, as their dry ness, and the openness of their texture, render them pecu liarly susceptible to changes of temperature, they assist in"], [176, "136 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF keeping the atmosphere in motion, and thus contribute to the healthiness and the fertility of the adjacent grounds ; nor is there any doubt that those sandy tracts, upon the lower part of the river in question, and the other rivers on the south of Hampshire, contributed not a little, in the early times, to the fertility of the upper valleys. Had they been marshes, or surfaces upon which water could stagnate in any quantity, the case would have been very different ; and Hampshire would not have been the favourite county which it was in the early times. By what means rivers of such small size as those in the south of Hampshire cut their way through this formation of sand and gravel, which in some cases forms more lofty, more proximate, and more steep banks, than even the chalk, it is not easy to conjecture ; and yet, there must have been a cutting open of the passages or the valleys of the rivers, and not an upheaving of the sand anel gravel ; for, though these are undoubtedly marine formations, they are formations which do not appear to have been disturbed by any sub terranean action, similar to that which upheaved the chalk. How those passages were opened is an interesting enquiry ; but it is one for the prosecution of which we have no data, and therefore, to speculate concerning it would be but a waste of time. The only other river which marks out a district in this part of Hampshire, is the H amble ; and though the country on the banks of this is, in its physical characters, very similar to that on the river last-mentioned, the Hamble is by much the smaller of the two. Its first sources are some trifling brooks, rising in the southern side of the downs about the line where the chalk and gravel overlap the clay. The middle one has its source a little to the northward of Bishop's Waltham, where it is a mere brook ; but, about a mile and a half lower down, it receives some other brooks from the west and the east ; and, thus augmented, it flows onwards for about two miles and a half to the village of Botley ; and thence onward for about six miles more to the"], [177, "137 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. sea, \u2014 the total length of its course not exceeding a mile and a quarter. The lower part of it, however, has a very slow current and deep channel, which render it navigable for craft of considerable burden. Of a geological nature, there is little in this part of Hamp shire, at least to the northward and westward of Portsdown, beyond what we have already stated. The small portion of land to the southward of the downs, intermediate between the harbours, and forming their beds or basins under the recent deposit of the waters, is a little more* interesting, be cause a little more varied, and therefore we shall devote a few sentences to it. We have already mentioned that the chalk formation lies under the tertiary and more recent strata, not only of the whole southern part of Hampshire, but under the bed of the narrow seas, or to the cropping out of the Isle of Wight ridge over the green sand, in the centre of that island. This is the general belief of those who are most competent to form an accurate judgment upon the subject, and it is fully borne out by the analogy of the basin which contains the tertiary formation in the great valley of the Thames. In deed, there can be no manner of doubt, that, at some depth or other, chalk is to be found in a continuous bed, from Beachy head, through Sussex, Hants, Wilts, and Dorset, round to Culver cliff in the Isle of Wight; and nowhere do we find stronger proofs of this than in the small patches of land which lie between Portsdown and the sea. There is no good fresh water obtainable in Portsea or the adjoining places, except by boring or sinking to a depth which is, in many instances, considerable ; and the strata which have been perforated there, though different in some particulars, and perhaps, upon the whole, indicating more severe, and, in all probability, also more recent action, yet there is no inconsiderable general resemblance to what has been found in the lower valley of the Thames. In all places which have been examined without reaching the chalk, the lowest stratum that has been met with in and about Ports- VOL. II. T"], [178, "138 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF mouth, is one of pure white sand, the water in which is abundant and of excellent quality, similar to the water that comes out where the gravel caps the chalk, and also to that which is found by boring through the London clay to the sand, in the valley of the Thames. Immediately over the sand there is a stratum of water-rounded pebbles. Over these pebbles there is a stratum of clay, similar in colour to the blue clay of the London formation, containing, like that, beds of sand in some places, occasionally furnishing pure water, but more frequently, water containing sulphuret of iron, and offensive to the smell from the sulphuretted hy drogen which it gives out. This clay varies greatly in thickness, just as it does in the similar formation at London ; and it contains the same species of shells, and in equal abundance. Over the clay, as is also the case in many parts of the valley of the Thames, there is a bed of gravel of considerable thickness, and increasing in thickness to sea ward. This gravel is mixed with masses of the clay which occurs at Stamshaw, in the island of Portsea, and has been named after that place ; and this shows that the gravel is of more recent formation than this clay. Not one of these formations over the chalk, from the white sanel to the gravel, or even the eleposit over that, appears to have been deposited in a perfectly tranquil state of the water; for they are all more or less gathered into inequalities ; and it is possible, anel even probable, that there may have been accumulations to a considerable depth, even since the time when the Romans had their harbour at Porchester. There can be no doubt, from the name they gave it, that the Romans regarded this as their best port in the Hampshire seas, preferable to both Bittern and Nutshalling. This is easily shown by the ety mology. It is true that, upon this, as upon most other matters which are doomed to suffer the infliction of their conjectures, the antiquaries have not been wanting in that peculiar mystification which is especially theirs, and which always puts one in mind of the rust upon the shelf of Scriblerus. They wdll needs derive Porchester, and con-"], [179, "139 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. sequently Portsmouth, from some real or imaginary Saxon of the name of Port, whereas nothing can be plainer than that \" Port \" in these names is the Latin Porta, and that Porchester is simply the castle or stronghold erected at the \"port\" for the protection ofthe gallies. Some of the authori ties mention the finding of a small anchor in the clay, at the depth of some forty or fifty feet ; and if such is the case, there must have been a very great formation of clay since the anchor was placed there. Nobody would dig to such a depth in order to bury an anchor, though, when the clay was in a soft and sludgy state, the anchor may, from its own weight, have sank to an indefinite depth. It should seem that there have been considerable gainings and losings, between the sea and the land, in this part of Hampshire, \u2014 far more reciprocating, indeed, than on any other part of the Channel shore \u2014 at least in recent times. It should seem that, at some former period, and not a very remote one, although history makes no particular record of it, there was a forest of timber on the southern or seaward part of Portsea island ; anel though the trees have gone, by what means is not said, the roots have remained, and may now be distinctly seen at the low-water of spring tides. There is no accounting for the freaks and alternations of the sea ; but it is, withal, a curious matter that, on one part of this sea-girt, and to all appearance, sea-produced islet, there shoulel be an anchor found fifty feet deep in the clay ; while at another, a forest has been demolished, the land upon which it stood washed away, and only the tree roots remain visible at low-water of spring tide ; and, to increase the marvel, and unsettle all our notions of the usual action of the sea, this demolition of the land has taken place where a bank is accumulating, and the real action of the sea becoming less and less every year. We do not, of course, deny the statement, we only say that it is an irregular one, and not explainable upon any of the ordinary principles which we are accustomed to call to our aid, when we wish to give anything like a philosophical explanation of the reci- t 2"], [180, "140 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF procal action of sea and land, or rather of the reciprocating action of the sea upon the land ; for the land is, of course, passive in all cases, whether of disintegration or deposit. But, although it is not easy, upon any of the common principles that are resorted to in such cases, to explain this double action of the sea, by which a portion of the Isle of Portsea is wearing away, while the bank to the eastward is increasing, yet the fact seems to be too well established for admitting of any doubt ; and it is corroborated by the cir cumstance that the harbours to the eastward, at Emsworth and Chichester, produce oysters of very superior quality; and also by the different nature of the deposits in those har bours and the bank which has formed, and is increasing, off the island. Oysters are known to fatten best in places where there is a deposit of the lighter matters of disinte grated land, as may be verified by examining the most noted oyster banks in the estuary of the Thames. The muddy bays about Colchester on the Essex coast, and the muddy channel of Swale, between the Isle of Sheppey and the main land of Kent, are the places of much celebrity for oysters. Now these are depositories for the finer particles of land which the sea is constantly demolishing. The cliffs about Aldborough in Suffolk, and those of the Isle of Sheppey are wearing away very fast ; and, while the pebbles, or portion that remains of any considerable size, go to the formation of sea-banks, sometimes not very far from the scene of demo lition, the lighter particles are carried to a greater distance, and dropped only where the water becomes still by the shal lowness and eddy of a creek or interrupted channel. Why the oysters should prefer this fine mud which has been wafted by the sea is not so easily explained ; but the proba bility is, that the mud collects numbers of those animalcul\u00e6 with which sea water abounds; and as the deposit and the supply are continually going on, the oysters get their food fresh and fresh every tide. Oysters are often artifi cially fatted by mixing barley-meal with the water in which they are kept ; and in former times, if it is not so still, oysters"], [181, "141 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. for the gourmands of Edinburgh used to be fatted at the places where the \" bittern,\" or brine, from the salt-pans was discharged. Now, it is contrary to all the analogies of na ture, that oysters should feed either upon barley-meal, or upon sulphate of soda or magnesia. The food of an oyster must be animal, whatever may be the species of animal upon which it subsists ; for oysters are not found in those places of the sea where there are vegetables ; and even though they were, the idea of an oyster grazing is a very ridiculous one. But the substances alluded to, as they are known to fatten the oysters, must do so, by in some way accumulating or developing that upon which the oysters feed; and the fine mud which has been borne by the sea appears to produce a similar effect. It further appears that, if the disintegrated matters consist chiefly of chalk or lime, the oysters do not thrive in it ; and the same may be said of almost all the mollusca. Hence, oysters are not found on the deposit of chalk mud to the westward of Portsmouth, while they are abundant and good in Chichester harbour. The mud which is deposited in that harbour may, in part, come from the de composition of the clay and marl on the south side of the Isle of Wight ; for, though the sand is found on the east coast of the island, the mud is not left upon any part of its shores, but carried farther to the eastward ; and the harbour of Chichester is, from the peculiar curve of the shore, the place to Which it is most likely to be brought. The bank off Selsea bill, and that to the eastward of Portsmouth harbour, consist of sand and gravel, not of mud; and, upon the prin ciple explained in last chapter, these ought to be deposited where the current of the water has more power than it can have in a place so land-locked as the harbour of Chichester, or that of Langston. The beach of Portsea island is not mud, but clean gravel ; and this again shows that there is a current which runs from that beach to some other place or places, carrying off the finer particles of whatever is disin tegrated ; but leaving the pieces which are of considerable magnitude and weight. Thus, from the peculiar direction"], [182, "142 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF of the currents in the sea near Portsmouth, we can under stand, in a \"general way, how the disintegration of the allu vial shore of the island, may be compatible with the forma tion anel increase of a shingle bank where the main currents run against each other. The points of confluence of these currents shift so much with the state of the winds, and of the swell which rolls into the Channel from the Atlantic, that the subject would require very long and minute atten tion, before one could come to any very certain conclusion respecting it ; and whether it shall ever be properly investi gateel may be doubted : there is no obvious usefulness in it, anel thus it holds out little temptation to undergo the labour, and encounter the danger of such an undertaking. The in habitants of the British Islands are more indebted to the sea, and have more opportunities of becoming acquainted with its economy and productions, than the people of any other country ; and yet they, generally speaking, know very little about it. Thus, for instance, we have one shore of the Channel, and the French have another, and one would naturally suppose that we ought to be the more successful fishers ; but, so far from this being the case, our fisher men very frequently complain, and pray for the interference of the legislature to prevent the French from beating them at their own trade upon the high seas. This prayer is a very natural consequence of ignorance, but that does not make it the less ludicrous even to hint at such a thing as the possi bility of our legislature, whatever they enact, being able to carry into execution a statute enforcing all French fisher men to be more unskilful than British, how unskilful soever the latter might be. It is true, that, except at particular spots, and for particu lar species of fish, the French coast of the Channel is better fishing ground than the British, as there are deeper bays, and the current of tide from the Atlantic, does not act so directly, or sweep along with such unbroken velocity. Of this there is a good illustration, which is intimately con nected with the physical history of the southern slope of"], [183, "143 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. Hampshire ; and, in so far as the county is maritime, this is, locally considered, one of the most interesting points. On many parts of the British shores, even of such as are rich in an agricultural point of view, the riches of the sea, form a great addition to the riches of the land, in the con stant supply of fish, in the most recent, and therefore the most wholesome condition. Now, if a stranger, who knew nothing of the actual economy of the British seas, were to have the map of England laid down before him, and to be desired to lay his finger upon the place where the local po pulation derived the greatest advantage from an abundant supply of fish, he would be very apt to lay his finger upon this part of Hampshire, and point to Portsmouth as the grand centre of a most extensive anel most valuable fishery. Now, so far is the fact being in accordance with this na tural inference from first appearances, that there is no mari time part of the United Kingdom so badly supplied with native fish, as the south coast of Hampshire ; and instead of Portsmouth having a good fish-market of its own, it receives its regular supply from London, which is also the case with Southampton, and all the other towns in Hants. The cod family (Gacloid\u00e6), may be regarded as the grand staple white fish. And almost the only one of these which is taken in the narrow seas of Hampshire is the whiting, one of the most delicate, but certainly the least substantial of the whole ; and it is found at particular spots, principally, we believe, in the clear water over the stony bottom of the western part of the Isle of Wight northward. There is another of the cod family which is often brought in con siderable numbers to the Portsmouth market for sale. This is the hake, or sea pike (merlucius) ; but so far from its appearance being the slightest indication of anything like a supply of fish upon 'the coast, the proof is all the other way ; for the hake is so inferior in quality, that it is never suffered to appear in any decent fish-market. It is a ranging fish, and exceeelingly voracious, following the pilchards, and actually swallowing them by the dozen. \u2014 Mr. Couch, of"], [184, "144 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF Polperro, in Cornwall, whose constant and successful inves tigations have thrown so much light upon the fishes and fisheries of the Channel, mentions seventeen pilchards hav ing been found in the stomach of an ordinary-sized hake. But though this worst of all fishes is sold in great numbers at Portsmouth, it is not caught on any part of the Hampshire coast, but is brought from that of Devon. Very few fishes of any species frequent the Hampshire shores ; and the few that do come, come but for a visit and off again. The discursive fishes, which retire to the deeps at one season of the year, and visit the shores for physio logical purposes at another ; are almost the only ones to be met with, excepting, perhaps, a few flat-fish ; and the bot toms, until a considerable opening from the land is gained, are by no means favourable for them. Of the herring fa mily, the common herring and the sprat are those which are principally taken ; and among the sprats which are brought to market, there are often specimens of other and curious species, as of the pipe fishes, especially the snake pipe-fish (Syngnathus ophidionj, small specimens of the dragonet, and some others which are curious but of no use. Yet the most renowned member of the whole herring family has been met with in some of the waters of this part of Hamp shire, and it might no doubt be found in others, perhaps in all the estuaries which have brackish water perfect, if due search were made for it. This is the renowned white-bait (Clupea alba), which is not only the daintiest dish that can be set before the worshipful the lord mayor and alder men of London ; but one, to partake of which, the lords of the privy council are annually rowed in state in the Ord nance barges. In the paucity of other piscine delicacies, it is some consolation for the Hantesian mayors and aldermen to know that, by making an annual pilgrimage to the Ham ble, between Botley and Hound, they can be as daintily re fected on white-bait, as the corporation of London, or her Majesty's prime minister himself. White-bait is a very delicate little fish, and though much of the zest of it de-"], [185, "145 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE pends on the cuisine, it is certainly an addition to the pro ducts of any waters in which it occurs ; and as it is not likely to be met with in the Hamble only, and not in any of the other estuaries, it is at least worth looking after. It is true, that, as compared with the longer rivers, the Hamble has some peculiarities. Scarcely any part of its course lies over the chalk, and thus its waters can have no calcareous impregnation ; in the second place, its estuary is larger in proportion to the volume of water, than that of any of the other rivers ; and thus the top of the brackish, the portion of the water which the white-bait seeks, moves up and down with the tide over a considerable range. This is not the case either with the Itchen or Test, or with the Titchfield river, and therefore it may be that this delicate little fish is not to be met with in them. Notwithstanding the occurrence of this delicacy in the place which we have named, the narrow seas on the south coast of Hampshire can scarcely be said to have any regular fishing ; and those who go to fish in a systematic manner, must go to a distance of from ten to twTenty miles from the coast, and practise that deep-sea fishing in which the French fishermen are said to be so superior to ours. Upon all coasts, fishes are more or less capricious \u2014 being plentiful for several years, and then found in limited num bers or not at all. This is especially true of all those fishes which congregate in large shoals ; and the reason seems to be that, except at some extraordinary spots, where food is brought abundantly by a constant current, they in time ex haust the food \u2014 eat their pastures bare as it were, and then they must retire for a time, in order that that upon which they subsist may again accumulate. According to the vul gar mode of expression, this looks very like reasoning in the fishes ; but such is not the case, it is a simple instinct, which we find in all animated nature, without any know ledge or reason in the case. But the fishes have not retired from the Hampshire seas, in order that their pastures may recover, and that they may VOL. II. U"], [186, "146 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF return and have plenty. Whether it was so from the be ginning we cannot tell ; but certainly all those seas are at present barren wastes to the more useful fishes ; and there is not the slightest chance that their character shall ever be changed. The Channel is nowhere a favourite resort for the cod family, other than the ranging ones and the small rock cod ; for there are in the Channel no banks upon which food for them, or that on which they feed, can be deposited. There are, however, many valuable species of fish in the mid-channel ; and the pilchards and mackerel, which are more southerly fishes than the common herring, are more plentiful and in better condition there than upon any other part of the coast. They do not, however, approach the shores in any considerable numbers, between the bill of Port land and Selsea. The reason seems to be, that the shores are in a state of continual change, either by being worn away, or by receiving fresh deposits ; while the bottom, to some distance from the shore, is swept by the gravel or shingle, which is constantly on its march eastward along the whole length of the line. Hence, there are few of the small ground animals which are found in such numbers on the more permanent shores ; and though the spawn of fishes may be deposited, it is swept away in some places, and buried in others. Where fishes come to the shores they generally come in succession, at different times of the year, so that the young of one species are ready to supply another with food, and these in turn repay the obligation by a very beautiful provision of nature. The same causes which prevent the sea fishes from com ing to the shores of Hants, prevent salmon from coming to the rivers. The barriers which are placed in the Itchen and Test, no doubt are, in part, the cause of this ; but it does not appear that there are many salmon in the South ampton Water, or in any of the narrow seas, at the time when they are found in the offings of the salmon rivers. Those which do stray into the estuaries, and are captured at the salmon-leaps, which are very close to the sea, are of"], [187, "147 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. very inferior quality, and evidently starved. There are never good salmon in a river, unless there are sands near the entrance of it; as the principal food of the salmon is the sand launce, and the young of other fishes ; and neither of these can be obtained in the Hampshire seas. Thus, when we take all the circumstances of the case into consi deration, we are brought to the conclusion that, though man may have done something to prevent salmon from coming into the Hampshire rivers, nature has done a great deal more ; \u2014 and generally, that, however productive the land of Hampshire may be of human food, little dependance can be placed upon those waters which so much indent the Hampshire shores. This is, perhaps, not much to be re gretted, because it naturally leads the people to concentrate their energies upon that which will be really useful to them, and makes them one people instead of two ; for, in all countries where there is an agricultural and a fishing popu lation, they are as far estranged from each other in their feelings and habits, as if they lived at opposite extremities of the globe. But, if the seas of Hampshire are thus, comparatively, unproductive of fish, the same cannot be said of the rivers ; for there are none in the kingdom in which trout and eels are more abundant, or of finer quality. From the calca- reous nature of the bottoms, and the filtering of the water through the grass of the meadows, there is perhaps not so much ground food for trout as in the rivers of some other counties ; but insects swarm upon all the waters in the county ; and, notwithstanding the hawking of vast numbers of swallows and swifts, the trout must come in for a full share. Now, insect-feeding animals are always peculiarly delicate and racy in their flesh ; and trout from clear streams are always superior to those from muddy water. For these reasons, the trout of Hampshire are very fine, and eels are quite as plentiful, and equally good in quality. All the va rieties are met with, \u2014 the sharp-nosed, the broad-nosed, and the yellow eel. They make their annual migrations to and u 2"], [188, "148 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS OF from the sea in vast multitudes ; and very many are taken in eel-pots, and in traps at the mill courses and other falls of water, as they descend the rivers in autumn and early win ter. Perhaps the Avon, which is a Hampshire river for part of its course only, is the best eel stream ; but there are numbers in all the rivers of the county, in what part soever they are situated. Lake fishes are few ; for though there are some artificial sheets of water, there is not a single natural lake in the county. Such is the supply of fish in the seas and also in the fresh waters of the county of Hants ; and we have thought best to offer these remarks as part of, or as connected with, the physical characters of the southern slope ; because, being opposite to the great anchorage, and the main outlet to the Channel, it is more immediately connected with the sea than any of the other districts which we have mentioned. The ornithology of Hants is particularly rich, especially in numbers. The deficiency of fishes and their fry upon the shores, makes the sea birds of bold wing more rare than they are in many other parts of the kingdom ; but the win ter visitants comprise almost all the species that are to be met with in the catalogues of migrant water birds. Run ning birds upon the shores are but few, in consequence of the absence of the small animals upon which these birds subsist ; but there are a good many, both of summer and of winter migrants, which resort to the more fenny parts of the course of the rivers. The smaller air and tree birds are very abundant ; and the swallow tribe are perhaps more plentiful than in any other county of England. Some of the woods on the gravelly soil are vocal with nightingales ; and what with the song of the robin and the missel-thrush in the winter months, there is no time of the year without its natural melody ; and when a severe storm comes, the chirp of sorrow comes in place of the song of joy. There is no want of the smaller hawks ; but there are no eagles, or larger hawks, except a straggler now and then. The great bustard is extinct even upon the most extensive downs ;"], [189, "THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. 149 but specimens of the little bustard occur, though even they are rare. We shall probably have something to say of the other races of animals when we come to treat of the New Forest. Such are some of the physical characters of the southern slope of Hampshire, both those which are peculiar to it, and those which are common to it and the rest of the county. There is nothing about them which is very striking, or which calls for any great breadth of detail. The most re markable, certainly, is the sterility of the sea; and the causes of that do not lie in anything peculiar in the land or climate of Hampshire, but in the peculiar action of the Channel upon the English shore. The geology of the district, and indeed of the county generally, might prepare us for this tameness of character. In the whole of the district, or indeed of the county, there is nothing that can, in strict propriety, be called a rock ; for though, in the language of geology, a bank of clay, or a bed of loose sand, is called a rock, yet a chalk cliff hardly comes under that denomination in the popular acceptation. Now, there is nothing apparent, as the surface in Hampshire, but chalk, gravel, clay, sand, and vegetable mould ; and the only bold escarpment which can be got on any of these, is the side of a chalk-pit, which is certainly not a picturesque object. But if the ground itself is not picturesque, nothing that is found upon it can be so. Both may be beautiful ; and no county can be more beautiful in the many outlines of its surface, or the vegetation with which that surface is clothed, than many parts of the county of Hants ; but when this has been stated, the quantum of this kind of commen dation is at an end, and there is no more to be said. The physical characters are in accordance; and therefore, any account of them must be common-place if it is true. The sterling worth of the county, in all that contributes to human happiness and comfort, far more than counterba lances any little defects that there may be in the absence of picturesque effect ; and as nothing can deprive the people of"], [190, "150 PHYSICAL CHARACTERS. the one, they need give themselves very little concern about the other, \u2014 the more so, that no trouble which they might give themselves could possibly be of the the slightest avail. The physical characters of a country or district have al ways a very considerable effect upon at least the physical development of the inhabitants ; and though, from the inter course which takes place between all its districts, this is necessarily less marked in England than in most countries ; but still, there must be differences, to some extent or other, between the inhabitants of those districts which are much contrasted with each other ; and, upon this hypothesis, the physical system of the people of Hampshire, ought, in ac cordance with the nature of the country, to be more deve loped and vigorous than the intellectual. But there are points of individual interest 'in this part of Hampshire, both as regards the past, and as regards the pre sent. These, however, cannot be generalised upon any one principal subject, either local or historical ; and therefore we have no alternative but to combine them with brief no tices of the more remarkable places."], [191, "151 HISTORICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL DETAILS. CHAPTER VII. SOUTHERN SLOPE. \u2014 HISTORICAL AND TOPOGRAPHICAL DETAILS. This portion of Hampshire has, of course, no history as a whole, and indeed no continuous history of any kind ; for the proprietorship of it has undergone many changes ; and, though men of considerable name have been born in it, in the lapse of ages, there has no great family of ancient ori- gin, come down to the present time, with anything corres- ponding to its former greatness. The chroniclers say, that this part of Hampshire was one of considerable interest be- fore the time of the Romans ; and that a strong fortification and town, or place of safety of some kind for the people, existed at Porchester, nearly four hundred years before the Christian epoch. This, though the legend is of course not to be implicitly relied on, is not improbable ; for the fact that C\u00e6sar found the capital of Cassivellaunus to consist only of a tangled portion of the wood near modern St. Alban's, and the ramparts, or defences, to be nothing else than felled trees, which, though they of course arrested the progress of the war-chariots of the Britons, were but a feeble defence against the onset of the Roman legions ; \u2014 although C\u00e6sar found this to be the condition of the fortified capital of the then most powerful prince among the midland Britons, yet it by no means follows that there might not have been, even"], [192, "152 SOUTHERN SLOPE. \u2014 HISTORICAL then, some sort of strong place here, with mud walls, though not very likely with the revetmens of stone \u2014 a means of de fence not known in any British camp the authenticity of which is well established. The accounts state that when Vespasian, while acting under Plautius, had completed the subjugation of the Isle of Wight to the Roman power, he crossed over to Porchester with his troops, in order to assist Plautius in reducing the country to the south of the Thames, \u2014 that to the north, from its more exclusively wooded cha racter, and the comparative ferocity of its inhabitants, being a more unprofitable conquest, and one which it was not easy to retain. It does not appear that much fighting was required in this vicinity, \u2014 probably because the Belg\u00e6 who inhabited these parts were, comparatively, a recent colony from the continent ; and most likely, indeed were, in the habit of re ceiving frequent reinforcements from it, as well for com mercial and other peaceful purposes, as for repelling the attacks of the inland Britons, or of gradually encroaching upon their territory, which appears to have been the Bel gic mode of procedure, \u2014 as we have endeavoured to show, when treating of the hill-forts and ramparts on the margin of Salisbury plain \u2014 a notice of which appears in the first volume of this work. It is probable, that though, at a sub sequent period, Bittern was the port, and Winchester the place of attraction ; yet that, as this part of Hampshire was the most easily approachable by sea, the first which those invading Hampshire came to, and remarkably well adapted for the shelter of war galleys from all injury of sea storms and tides, Porchester, or the vicinity of Porchester, was the main point at which the successive bodies of invaders landed. It does not appear that any Roman road extended in a north easterly direction from this port or landing-place ; and in deed, it is probable that, in those days, the whole of the district between Portsdown and the Butser heights, was one tangled forest ; and, from the strong clay and consequent retentiveness of the soil in some places, it is probable that"], [193, "153 AND TOPOGRAPHICAL DETAILS. it was not very practicable. In those times, this thick fo rest appears to have extended, with scarcely any interrup tion, to Bishop's Waltham; and, for this reason, no doubt, the' Romans laid down the line of their roael to the south west, \u2014 as their object appears always to have been to carry these roads over open and elevated tracts. In this, they most likely had two objects in view: first, to obtain dry positions for their roads ; anel such positions as that these would neither be laid under water, nor broken up by the violence of torrents. In the then state of the country, this displayed considerable tact in engineering ; because the da mages which they thereby avoided, were the ones most likely to ensue, where so much of the ground over which the road passed, was completely in a state of nature. But secondly, they had regard to the personal safety of their troops and the security of their supplies, by laying the lines of road across places where there was the least chance of their parties being betrayed into an ambuscade. Like all other barbarous or semi-barbarous nations, the Britons, especially those of the interior, were bush-fighters ; and the term interior, had at that time, a different signification from what it has now. It did not so much imply a certain lineal distance from the sea, as a certain thickness and entangle ment of forest; and, on this account, there is every reason to believe that, in the time of the Romans, such a district as that of the forest of Bere and Waltham chase, was as completely the interior as the midland counties themselves. The Roman road may still be traced on the downs be tween Chilcomb and Morested ; and also near Wickham, and in some other places ; but, generally speaking, it is oblite rated. Some Roman remains have been found along the line of this road ; but they have not been very numerous. Where the road remains entire, or nearly so, upon the high and naked downs, it is not likely that any Roman villas would be erected ; and the richer parts have been so long under cultivation, and were so for so many years before proper attention was paid to memorials of antiquity, that it VOL. II. X"], [194, "154 SOUTHERN SLOPE. \u2014 HISTORICAL is natural to suppose that destruction must have been the fate of whatever the Romans left there. What description of fort or strong place the Romans may have had for the accommodation and protection of the guard of their shipping here it is not easy to say. The castle walls, and also the towers of the keep, the ruins of which still remain, are cer tainly not Roman, although the age and founder of them are but imperfectly known. Indeed, it does not appear that the present castle of Porchester was built with any view to the protection of shipping, or of anything else, other than the vassels and property of its lord in case of emergency. It ap pears to have been early abandoned as a shipping place, in consequence of the superior advantages of Portsmouth ; and thus, though the road remained during the time of the Ro man influence in this part of the country, and probably for a long time after, it is most likely that the shipping port was transferred to Portsmouth, during the time that the Romans, or those acknowledging the Roman sway, had peaceable possession of this part of England, and the opposite part of France ; between, which an extensive trade, especially in grain, the produce of this part of the country, was carried on, and for the facilitating of which, Portsmouth appears to have been, if not the only harbour, at least one of those which were most frequented. This port, with the Roman road into the interior, are al most the only parts of the district which can be said to have an ancient general history ; for there is little else of human construction in it that reaches beyond the time of the Ro mans. There are no doubt, barrows and embattled lines in various places, and some of the eminences still retain the name of Beacon hill, no doubt from the beacon-fires being kindled on them to give the country notice of the appearance or landing of an enemy. Of these beacons, the most conspicuous one, and indeed the only one which retains its name, is Beacon hill, the summit of which is about a mile west of Warnford. It is very centrally situated, and can be seen from great part of the district, and also from a"], [195, "155 AND TOPOGRAPHICAL DETAILS. considerable portion of the country which has its general slope northward to the upper part of the Itchen. In an easterly direction, this hill commands the whole valley of the Meon ; while northward, the view ranges along all the level of the country, and to the downs near Aires ford and Tichborne. Old Winchester hill, with its ancient encampment and its barrows, partially cuts off the view on the south-east, and Portsdown conceals all the three har bours ; but the whole southern part of the district is com manded ; and, therefore, a signal fire lighted upon this hill, would very speedily raise and collect to the heights, all the strength of the county, in case of danger appearing. It is not likely that this was a place for giving signal of an enemy on the coast, unless, which is probable, there had been another beacon upon Portsdown ; and though we can have no certain evidence, the probability is, that, like most of the other beacons, and places of alarm, or of resistance, which occur in this part of England, the watch was kept by the people on the coasts, against the incursions of those who lived more inland. The battles appear to have been fought on the line of the downs, and, generally speaking, to the northward or westward of the places of rendezvous. Kil meston down, immediately north-westward of the beacon hill of Warnford, appears to have been the scene of some severe struggles ; for there is a succession of barrows, ex tending over a distance of more than a mile from east to west, with some straggling ones, as though the battle had raged over a considerable extent. In further proof that the lines of defence, and other works which show some slight knowledge of the art of war, were constructed by the people who held the lands towards the coast, we find that there are no such defences along the south side of the downs, as if any armed force, coming from that direction, had been attempted to be repelled here. In the eastern part, also, there are no lines on the north of the summit which are now visible or at least conspicuous ; but when we come westward to about Longwood wan-en, x 2"], [196, "156 SOUTHERN SLOPE \u2014 HISTORICAL traces of ancient fortifications are abundant ; and so they are upon that part of Twyford down, where the ancient Roman way, and the modern road to Portsmouth from Winches ter, get upon the heights. In some places, however, upon these downs, it is not very easy to distinguish between an cient tracts and channels worn by the winter rains, and some of the ruder lines of ancient fortification. Wherever the slope of the country is gentle, and a long extent of it can be commanded from the heights, there is seldom any fortifica tion ; because, in such situations, the people could see an enemy, and be prepared for his reception before he came so near as to do any injury ; but wherever there is a deep dell, there is generally a line of defence carried round the upper part of it ; and this occurs in situations where, from present appearances, such works are much less needed, than in other places where there are none. But in matters of this kind, we must not be deceived by present appearances ; be cause those dells which are now bare, except of grass or corn as may be, were probably, indeed we may say certainly, covered with thick woods in the early times ; and the ene my could of course approach to the very margin of this cover quite unobserved. Hence the necessity of artificial defences, in those very places which now appear to have the best natu ral ones. The position in which we, in this part of Hampshire, inva riably find the forts and lines of defence in reference to the surface of the county, confirms the statements that the colo nists, who took possession along the coast, and worked their way gradually into the interior, were a more civilised, domes ticated, and wealthy people, than those whom they had dis placed, \u2014 that they had fixed habitations, and cultivated fields, and flocks, which excited the cupidity of the more savage inlanders, and tempted them to be continually on the watch, in order to pass the downs, and plunder the fields and neigh bours. This is not only established by the position of the remains of the defences, and by the fact that the people of the coast carried on a considerable trade with Gaul, the"], [197, "157 AND TOPOGRAPHICAL DETAILS. merchants of which frequently visited England in order to transact business ; but it is in strict accordance with what was very common in Ireland and in Scotland, down to times comparatively recent. The English proprietors within the Pale, were very generally obliged to buy forbearance from the Irish without, by paying \" Black Mail \" to the chiefs ; and the same was the case with those along the border of the Scotch Highlands, down almost to the middle of the last century. It is thus that when we carefully compare the physi cal conditions of countries, and the relations of classes of people in different ones, who are similarly situated with re gard to each other, we obtain the knowledge of a general principle, which we can afterwards apply without the labour of an original investigation. This part of Hampshire was for a very long time a sort of \" Black Mail \" country ; or, at all events, there was within the centre of it, a pretty considerable tract of country, which without being of much benefit to any one, was the cause of much local demoralisation, and of no little mischief and an noyance to the peaceable part of the inhabitants. This was the Forest of Bere, to the situation and soil of which we have already slightly alluded in a former chapter, but which deserves a more particular notice than was then given. The passion which the kings, nobles, and more influential clergy of England, had for forests and the chace, especially in the Norman times, was perhaps natural enough in them ; but it is a system which is obviously inconsistent with anything like civilised society ; and from the proximity of the forests to the south coast, \u2014 which have been long notorious for smug gling, and which most demoralising practice perhaps no ac tivity of the coast-guard can put down, but which will thus continue a most effective means of corrupting the people, until some administration shall have the wisdom to reduce the duties on articles now smuggled to a reasonable rate, and thus obtain a much larger revenue from the fair trade, save all the present expence, and abate the nuisance of smug gling, in the only way in which it can be thoroughly abated, \u2014"], [198, "158 SOUTHERN SLOPE. \u2014 HISTORICAL the New Forest and this forest of Bere are both admi rably fitted for affording hiding-places, where the smuggled articles can be stowed away, thence to be afterwards dis tributed over the country as occasion may offer. It is not, however, with the cover which these forests afford to smuggling and smugglers, that we have to deal in the present instance. It is with the effect of them as forests, or rather, with the forest of Bere viewed in that light. At one time, this forest of Bere appears to have extended over a large surface, \u2014 say about eleven miles in length by three in average breadth ; but for a long time it has been diminishing. No William the Conqueror can be accused, falsely or otherwise, of having desecrated churches by the dozen, and dismissed people by the score, in order that he might drive the deer with hound and horn in this forest. On the contrary, there is not now a single church in the whole extent of it, nor are there the least indications of one ever having been there. There are some, both on the south and the north ; but these are far apart from each other, as compared with what occurs in those districts of Hampshire which had any considerable population in the early times. This forest was never, at least for many years, entirely a royal forest ; but consisted of a number of purlieus, making up the east walk and the west walk, as they were called; and amounting altogether, about the end of the seventeenth century, to some 16,000 acres, of which great part has since been enclosed. In each of the walks, the crown had a demesne, and the royal deer were free of the whole forest, as well as the deer belonging to the proprietors of the pur lieus. Besides this, the inhabitants of the neighbouring parishes had the privilege of pasturing cattle, but not sheep, all the year round ; and this privilege very naturally led the said people, or any body in short, to add liberty to privilege, and take possession of the forest lands, build hovels upon them, scratch little spots for a kind of crop, and trust to the forest and the surrounding country for all the rest. The result of all this was, that, notwithstanding the array of"], [199, "159 AND TOPOGRAPHICAL DETAILS. warden, verderers, master-keepers, under-keepers, regarders, agisters, cum multus aliis, the forest was worth nothing to the crown ; and, except such portions as were enclosed and cultivated, it was of little value to anybody. Some idea may be formed of the profit made by the exchequer, or the privy purse, or whatever else was the receptacle of the proceeds, from the statement of the report made in 1792, which bore that, though apparently an accumulation of timber which had been going on, assisted by artificial means, for eighty or ninety years, the rent per acre, after paying the high-sounding establishment, most of whom were proprietors of purlieus, amounted to the sum of one shilling per acre annually ; while the adjoining land let on an average at ten shillings, and the cultivators made a profit after that. Such were the returns in money value from the royal demesnes in the forest of Bere. Just to show the difference between this royal forest, in a fine climate and producing oaks, and a piece of wild moor in the north of Scotland, which had been planted by the proprietor, and had cost nothing for an establishment, the return, when the Scotch firs were cut down in 1807, we believe amounted to one guinea an acre, allowing interest on the outlay, whereas, were interest charged on the outlay in the case of the royal portion of Bere forest, the yearly return would be .reduced to something less than a penny an acre. Notwithstanding this, the royal venison eaters did not get fat upon haunch and pasty during the period alluded to ; for the report goes on to state, \" the crown has an unlimited right of keeping deer on 16,000 acres, and to be supplied with venison without stint ; yet the stock (200) is hardly equal to a private park, and none are supplied from thence for the use of the royal household ; nor indeed is the venison worth having for nothing, being so bad that it is scarcely fit to eat at all.\" It will not for a moment be supposed that the real produce of the forest, even allowing for the expense of the cumbrous, unnecessary, and absurd establishment, was not"], [200, "160 SOUTHERN SLOPE. \u2014 HISTORICAL much greater than this ; because it is not possible that an acre of oak forest, in the south of Hampshire can fail in being at least twice as valuable as an acre of Scotch fir in Invernesshire. But it should seem that the timber, the land,. and the deer, were considered and made free booty, without the slightest hesitation or feeling of wrong done ; and, independently of the loss, it was here that the demora lising effect was so very great. The sprays and suckers were taken indiscriminately by the people of all the neigh bouring country ; and as they were taken without the slight est regard to the preservation of a succession, the growth of trees was effectually prevented. Then, partially on the royal demesnes, but much more on the private purlieus, the worthless from all parts of the country came and established themselves, constructing miserable huts in concealed places, and living in a state of the utmost misery and depravity. There was scarcely a vice of which demi-savages can be guilty which these free-booters of the forest did not per petrate ; and not a hen-roost, or even a house, within a night's journey backwards and forwards, was secure against their depredations, which depredations, by some strange neglect, went for a long time unpunished ; and as, among the uneducated, vice has only to be daring enough to be admiretl and imitated, the baneful example of these bush rangers spread rapidly over the neighbourhood. This rose to its height in the early part of the eighteenth century, during which time deer-stealing became the most fashionable, and locally the most honourable and honoured, trade in the district ; and to deer-stealing all the other vices of the poacher were added as matter of course. They by no means contented themselves with the forest and what it afforded, but waged indiscriminate war upon forest and flood, field and farm-yard, carrying on their depredations vi et armis, to the terror, as well as the loss, of all who did not belong to their unholy fraternity. That their persons might be less easily known, in case justice should awaken from its supineness, they blackened their faces when they went out"], [201, "161 AND TOPOGRAPHICAL DETAILS. upon their forays ; and as Bishop's Waltham was, nominally at least, their capital and head-quarters, they were denomi nated the \"Waltham Blacks,\" though they styled them selves the \" Waltham Hunters,\" as a more honourable ap pellation. So honourable in their own estimation, and so powerful in reality, did they become, that no young man in the neighbourhood could appear in public, without the brand of being cowardly and mean-spirited, if he was not recog nised as a \" Hunter\" ; and they even carried matters so far as to demand \"Black Mail,\" or, in other words, to sell a protec tion to any one who wished to preserve his warren, his fish-pond, or any other place where game of any description was to be had. It may seem somewhat singular that the local authorities did not interfere in the early stage, and put this down ; but it is a pretty general fact, though not easily accounted for, that the local authorities never can succeed in putting down any similar breach of the law, after it has taken root in the minds of the people, and a certain degree of eclat has been attached to it. Perhaps we should acquit the authorities of any connivance or collusion, and suppose that the fear of retaliation upon themselves personally, or upon those or that in which they are interested, restrains them. But, whatever may be the cause, they never succeeel in such cases, and they make the attempt with very palpable reluctance. In this case, the magistrates pretended that the offences which were committed were against forest law, and not against the king's peace ; and upon this plea they declined to interfere. Thus the matter went on, until, in 1723, it led to the enactment of the sanguinary statute known by the name of the Black Act, \u2014 and it is truly one of the very blackest in the statute book, dark-visaged as many others are. As it unfortunately happens, the people sympathise with the perpetrators of crimes against the excise and customs laws and the game laws, after the com mission of such crimes has become common ; and thus the severity of the law did not either bring all the offenders to justice, or put an end to the practice. But the location of VOL. II. Y"], [202, "162 SOUTHERN SLOPE. \u2014 HISTORICAL the houseless within the purlieus, the plundering of the timber, and the almost total extinction of the deer, turned out to be more certain means of abolishing the iniquity, the immoral effects of which continued for a long time. Some of the means which the \" Hunters \" and the settlers in the forest adopted for the procuring of game, were emi- nently fitted for the accomplishment of this purpose. They prowled about in quest of the calves at the time when they were elropped, and having found them, they shaved off the hoofs, so that they were unable to walk; and then, after they had been suckled for a time, returned to the same lairs, and bore them off as prizes. It is doubtful whether there is any royal forest, or any extensive wild, chace, or preserve, which does not produce some moral evil to the neighbouring population ; but perhaps there is none in England which has done so much mischief of this kind as the forest of Bere, and none which has been more worthless to the pro- prietors. There remains only one other subject of a ge- neral nature to be noticed, with reference to the southern slope of Hampshire. This is the royal arsenal, and other government establishments at Portsmouth ; but as they are not characteristic of the district in any way, other than being situated in it, we shall defer them to another chapter, and proceed with the local details, of which we need give only very short notices. In treating of the details, that is, in noticing the towns. parishes, and places of importance, there is some little diffi culty in selecting an arrangement of the sub-divisions which shall be clear and at the same time natural. After some consideration, we have adopted a sort of sub-division into six sections. First, the places on the Hamble, from the summits of Twyford down and Longwood warren, to the confluence ofthe Hamble with the Southampton Water; secondly, the valley of the Titchfield river, from the sources between But ser and Old Winchester hills, to the confluence with the So lent ; thirdly, from the ridge of Butser hill, to the centre of the forest of Bere, southward ; fourthly, the plains between"], [203, "163 AND TOPOGRAPHICAL DETAILS. the remains of that forest and Portsdown ; fifthly, the borders of Sussex from the summit of the ridge of the downs, to Havant and Emsworth, including Hayling island ; and sixthly, Portsea island, and the other places to the south of Portsdown, including Gosport and some of the adjacent places. These are very unequal in size, and lie in rather a confused order; but they have some sort of natural bounda ries, by means of which they can be referred to the map as a general index of positions. 1. The H ample. For some miles to the south of the sum mit of Twyford down and Longwood warren, the surface is very bare, and there is scarcely a tr*#e or a human habitation to be seen. The summit of the downs is flat, with short grass, and forms a very healthy, though by no means a rich sheep-walk. This summit commands most extensive and beautiful views ; and it is much frequented for rural sports in the summer ; but in winter it is very bleak. For a consi derable distance, both south and east, there is little soil over chalk ; but after a space, that begins to be covered with a thin coating of mud, clay, or marly sand ; but the chalk is again at the surface on the heights, to the south of the first descent. The descent from the chalk downs to the clay, and gravel, and loam, is by no means in an uniform inclined plane ; but by a number of hollows and ridges, the former penetrating a considerable way into the downs in some places, and the latter running into the low grounds in others. There is not a vestage of running water for several miles to the southward of the downs, and the few trees that make their appearance, are yews, junipers, and hawthorns, equally remarkable for their diminutive size and the slight alteration of their appearance from year to year. The first place of any note that one meets, is the small church of Morested about three miles south-east of Winchester, on the road to Bishop's Waltham. It is rather on the western slope, and thus properly speaking, in the valley of the Itchen ; but the upper parts of the hollows overlap each other here, that it is not easy to say which way the actual inclination is. \u2014 This Y 2"], [204, "164 SOUTHERN SLOPE. \u2014 HISTORICAL and the two following parishes have already been slightly noticed in the description of the Eastern Downs. South of Morestead there is another high and naked down, to the south of which there is a pleasant valley, finely sheltered by heights from the north and east, and containing Longwood park, a seat of the earl of Northesk. There are some rich fields and judiciously arranged plantations in the neighbour hood, and the surface is varied by a constant succession of hill anel dale. Owslebury, about two miles south of Morestead, is a much larger parish, but the living is only a curacy, in conjunction with the rectory of Twyford, the next parish on the west. The village of Owslebury is long and straggling ; anel the surrounding surface is considerably diversified by downs and plantations of timber. The soil is also very varied, being thin chalk in some places, and varying in others from that to stiff clay. Upham, the next parish to the southward is almost equi distant between Owslebury and Bishop's Waltham, and about two miles and a half from each. As the name implies it is partly on the heights. This parish has deserved some literary name, from being the birth-place of Young, the author of the Night Thoughts, tragedies, satires, and other poems. Young was a genuine poet ; and there are some as fine conceptions in his writings, especially in the Night Thoughts as are any where to be met with ; but many of his figures are strained to excess ; and they are sometimes hard and out of nature. His satires are often keen and biting, but they are apt to show the elisappointed pride of the author so prominently as to take off no inconsiderable part of the effect which they would have produced, if the doctor had maintained his temper, and kept himself a little more in the back ground. The same fault pervades the Night Thoughts, which, if it had not been for the perpetual recurrence of selfish allusions, would cer tainly have been one of the best poems without a principal subject, in the English language. Some of his creations, or imaginations would be truly sublime, were it not that they are"], [205, "165 AND TOPOGRAPHICAL DETAILS. sometimes broken, and sometimes by far too quaint. His en quiries as to what goes on among the stars, are very apt to send one for answers to the learned confabulations between Hudibras and Sidrophel. The passions of his dramatic cha racters are powerfully delineated, but they are not human. Notwithstanding these minor faults, Dr. Young was a great man ; and the divinity of his writings is sound, and the mo rality excellent, He was born at the rectory of this parish in 1681, and died in 1765 at the aelvanced age of 84, having out-lived, by several years, all the literary companions of his earlier days, and from family bereavements, having been left almost alone at the close of his life. If we take the most elevated summit of the downs, namely from Twyford down south-eastward to the Beacon hill at Warnford, there is no parish church or parish village on the south side, nor are there many habitations of any kinel until one arrives at the market town of Bishop's Waltham. This town is situated in rather a pleasant valley by the side of a little stream of water, the infant Hamble, which river indeed never attains much size until it reaches the -estuary, which maybe said to commence at Botley, farther down, where the navigation ends. The ground from Bishop's Waltham to the summit of the high downs is of the same diversified character as that of the parishes last noticed \u2014 that is to say, it consists of naked grounds and commons, interspersed with clumps of wood, and sheltered dells and hollows, some of the last containing strong and rich land. The trees too, are in some places fine and healthy in their vegetation, and less gnarly and covered with lichen then they are upon the hills more exposed to the south-west winds ; and were it not that there is a paucity of water, some spots between Waltham and the high downs, would furnish an artist with sweet little sub jects for his pencil. The line ofthe high downs to which we have referred as terminating at Beacon hill by Warnford, is considerably the highest, at least taken upon the whole, between this natural district and the upper valley of the Itchen. But though the"], [206, "166 SOUTHERN SLOPE. \u2014 HISTORICAL highest, it is difficult to say, whether, after one passes to the eastward of Longwood warren and Gander down, it be the summit level. The chalk heights here, diverge from the great mass on the south-east of the vale of Chilcomb, as from a central plateau \u2014 a point at which the chalk had been upheaved in mass, and sustained in mass when the valleys eastward and westward were depressed. We have heard it stated that, in this neighbourhood, the chalk rests im mediately upon the upper oolite without the intervention of any green sand; and it is not improbable that this may be pretty generally the case where the chalk appears in masses, as the oolitic beds form of course a more solid basis for it than the sand does ; and it is probable that, where the ridges of chalk break off from the plateau, the sand may be always found under them. Be that as it may, there has been a division into three parts from these downs eastward. One branch trends north-east, and with various degrees of eleva tion, passes by the southward of Alresford, until it reaches Var down, only it is disrupted where the southern branch of the Itchen finds its way northward, from what has probably been the bed of a lake, extending southward and eastward by Cheriton and Bramdean, and inosculating at its upper extremity with the valley of Meon, and the passage through the eastern chalk-hills to the amphitheatre of Petersfield. The central ridge passes eastward, by Hinton Ampner, and forms the northern boundary of the valley of Meon, to the eastward of Warnford. Its elevation is nowhere considerable, it is interrupted at some places, and generally speaking, it admits of profitable culture to the very top. This is what may be called a plain part of the county, that is, it has no bold features, but still the surface is agreeably, though gently, diversified with swells and hollows. On the north, the ground rises very gently toward the heights that pass into the northern part of the county at Windmill hill, and north-east it runs toward Tisted common and Var down, a large extent, being seen from the height at Hinton Amptner. From the elevated situation and the general openness of the"], [207, "167 AND TOPOGRAPHICAL DETAILS country, the winters are cold and frequently rainy ; but in summer, the climate is healthy and agreeable. Open com mons are neither numerous nor extensive ; but there is a considerable extent of copse and planting tastefully spotted about, which adds greatly to the beauty and interest of the landscape. The parish of Tisted lies in the extreme north east, upon the confines of that district which we have already noticed under the title of the eastern slope of the county, The population of the parish of West Tisted is 264, and the rental about 1400/., Magdalen College, Oxford, having the patronage of the living, The extent of parishes in this part of Hampshire must not, however, be judged of from the estimated rental or population ; for along the ridge here the air is very bleak, and in the winter season the roads are difficult. Basing park, about a mile north-east of the church of Privet, is the largest demesne in these parts ; and to the north-east of it, there is a considerable extent of open down. Bramdean has a smaller rental and less numerous popu lation than the above parish ; but the situation is pleasant, and there are more genteel residences spotted about in the straggling village than are usually to be seen in places of such rural character. The high-road from Winchester to Petersfield lies through the bottom of the valley, and the villas and cottages are situateel along the sides of the road, from which the surface rises both to the north and the south. The church stands upon the brow of the hill to the south ward, partly enclosed among trees, and it contrasts finely with a modern villa on the left, and a rustic farm-yard on the right. It is a small edifice of ancient but unknown date, consisting of an aisle and chancel. It has recently been repaired and decorated internally in a very tasteful and appropriate manner, by the present rector (1839), the Rev. Charles Walters. He has had the ceiling of the aisle raised, and an organ gallery constructed against the western wall; he has also had the altar modelled in the gothic style, the whole interior of the chancel painted after the fashion of the old"], [208, "168 SOUTHERN SLOPE. \u2014 HISTORICAL Norman frescoes, and the passage from the aisle to the chancel broken off by a light screen; so that, taking it altogether, it is one of the neatest and most appropriate small rural churches in the kingdom, and reflects great credit on the liberality and refined taste of the rector ; whose example in this, as in many other respects, would, if gene rally followed by the incumbents of other parishes, tend greatly to endear the people to the church, and thus be equally conducive to the interests of religion and morality. Mr. Walters has also an excellent library, an observatory, and philosophical apparatus ; and has given a tone to the neighbourhood which one seldom has the pleasure of finding in rural places. The consequence is, that there are many families of superior taste in the neighbourhood, and the vale of Bramdean has a society of its own. The prospect of the valley, as seen from the church, is very beautiful ; and the dispersal of the villas and cottages over a considerable space, gives them an air of repose far more in character with the scene than if they were huddled together in one spot. The situation of Hinton Amptner, which lies about a mile south-west of Bramdean, is more elevated, and the parish is more extensive and wealthy. There is much good land in the parish, which, like the others in this part of the county, has its surface a good deal varied by plantations. Kilmeston, which is situated to the south of Hinton Ampt ner, lies more on the elevated part of the downs, and a con siderable portion of the surface is not under culture. These two parishes, as also Bramdean, have been already mention ed in the description of the southern branch of the Itchen, but are necessarily again referred to here. From Kilmeston down and Beacon hill, the downs con tinue southward, between the valley of the river at Warn ford and Corhampton on the east and the upper part of the valley of the Hamble on the west, while another branch extends southward on the west side of the latter, and con tinues its elevation as far to the southward as Bishop's Waltham. There are considerable diversities of surface"], [209, "169 AND TOPOGRAPHICAL DETAILS. line, and some extent of plantation or copse, but no village of any consequence, until we arrive at the market town of Bishop's Waltham.* * There is, in the parish of Bramdean, a field of much interest to the antiquary. This field lies about a quarter-of-a-mile to the north-east of the manor-house of Woodcote, upon the top of one of those gently swell ing eminences which are so common in this part of Hampshire. As is the case with all the elevated fields in this part of the country, it is very thickly strewed with flints, and fragments of Roman bricks are almost as nume rous ; and there are also many pieces of thin stone, such as the Romans used for bonding corners ; or as the Saxons and early Normans are sup posed to have used for roofing. These remains of ancient architecture are rarely found out of the one field which has, from time immemorial, been called \" gaol field ;\" but they are so plentiful on it, as to show that there, the work of demolition has been considerable. In the eastern part of the field there is a Roman pavement, in a state of tolerable preservation. It consists of a rectangular floor, about 75 feet long, and 27 feet broad, with a square of 24 feet projecting southward from the western part of it. The first room in the east has a plain floor of small square bricks ; the second, is surrounded by three feet of the same pavement, and within this there is a tessellated pattern, with a Gorgon's head in the middle, and eight compartments, which have had emblematical busts. Mercury and Pallas can still be traced, but the others are very much faded. To the westward of this, there is a narrow apartment, a large one, and another narrow one, all with plain floors, and the last so far broken down as to show the arched passage by which the room to the south has been heated by fire in this one. From the arch of entrance, the heated air has been led in arched passages ah under the floor, and thence up the walls in flues, con structed of a succession of single-brick tubes of rectangular section, but very broad in proportion to their depth, and thus well-constructed for the economy of heat. The arches below have given way, so that the floor of this apartment has sunk down in many places ; but still it is the most per fect of the whole. The centre, within a very elegant border, contains two athlet\u00e6, probably Hercules and Ant\u00e6us, wrestling, with Minerva looking on ; and the time of action appears to be that at which the crafty goddess gave the demigod a hint, as to how he might overcome the mere mortal ; for Hercules has just got the feet of his antagonist off the ground, and is giving him a mote than Cornish hug. Busts and other figures fill up the space between the centre and the external circle of the pattern ; and the dolphins, lavatories, and other emblems in the corners and margin, lead one to suppose that this may have been a bath, which is further con firmed by the flues, which are on all sides of this apartment, and not in any of the others. The floors of the apartments are of unequal elevation, \u2014 the ornamented ones being, in general, lower than the others. The walls are in tolerable preservation to the height of about a foot above the pavements. They are composed of flints and mortar, and stuccoed ; and they have been painted in fresco, but no part of any figure remains in the fragments. This is a most interesting remain of antiquity ; and it reflects the highest honour upon the lord of the manor and proprietor, Mr. Green wood of Brookwood, one of the most extensive landholders in this part of VOL. II. 7,"], [210, "170 SOUTHERN SLOPE. \u2014 HISTORICAL Bishop's Waltham is a pleasantly situated country town ; but it probably has not the same relative importance as when it was a country residence of the princely bishops of Winchester in the middle ages. Waltham literally means \"weald hame,\" the home in the wood, forest, or chace ; and it is not improbable that, in the early times, a very considerable portion of the surrounding district had this character. The soil is still favourable for the. growth of timber, and there are some fine trees in the vicinity of the town, \u2014 within a mile and a half of the east of which Waltham chace commences, which chace used to be the especial hunting-ground ofthe bishops ; and, as these exalted personages were very generally of a militant, or even a military character, it is most likely that they preferred \" the princely art of venerie \" to devotion ; and that the horn in Waltham chace called them to the matins as often as the bell at Winchester \u2014 especially at that season when the bucks of the olden time were \" in pride of grease.\" This was all as it should have been ; for, if it was the fashion of the time that priests should be princes, it behoved them to demean themselves as such. The ruins of the bishop's palace, a very considerable por tion of which still remains, show how splendid the hunting seat of those prelates must have been in the days of their power and' its glory. It had occupied a very beautiful situation, on a bank of rich land, on the left side of the little river, and immediately on the south-west of the present town. The river, or rather rivulet, \u2014 for the quantity of run ning water is very small here, was embanked, and still forms a fine sheet of water, seen across which, the ruined palace, and the quiet and thriving modern town, afford a the county, that he has had the whole preserved in situ, instead of carry ing it off, as a man of more cupidity and vanity, and less refined taste, would have done. Mr. Greenwood has had the whole enclosed in a sub stantial building, the key to which may be obtained at the manor house of Woodcote, by any one who is known, or otherwise properly recommended ; and as there is no fee, no cicerone, and no attendant, the visitor is left to the unbroken flow of his meditations upon times now gone by, and on the frail and fleeting nature of the glory of man."], [211, "Wbuhestrt Juhluhed for flie Jhpnetot Ja.' Sullim CoUtat ./,.,/"], [212, ""], [213, "AND TOPOGRAPHICAL DETAILS. 171 striking contrast, but withal a pleasing picture. The palace, according to the accounts, was first founded by Bishop Henry de Blois, the brother of King Stephen, and one of the most militant and castle-building of all the great bishops \u2014 as the ruins of Wolvesey and the heaps at Merdon still demonstrate ; but the precise date is not known, neither is it a point of much consequence. In all probability it was about the middle of the twelfth century ; and at that time it was no doubt a place of strength, and the lodge a castle keep. It is also likely that the rivulet was embanked, and the pond made, in order to furnish a supply of water for the moats. It does not appear to have been a general or favourite residence, until the time of Wykeham, who repaired and re-built it \u2014 in accordance with that splendid architectural taste which had first obtained for him the patronage of the king ; and ultimately, through that, the see of Winchester. It is said, indeed, that the outer court, now converted into a farm-yard, was built by Bishop Langton, and other por tions are attributed to different prelates. It is probable, however, that the portion which has been the most splendid, and of which the largest remain is left, was erected by Wykeham. This was the hall, which has been of the most magnificent dimensions ; and was no doubt finished and fur nished in a corresponding style. One wall remains in a tolerably entire state, and the other parts can, in so far, be traced. These remains indicate a length of sixty-six feet, a breaelth of twenty-seven, and a height of twenty-five. Such dimensions are magnificent; and though we might reasonably ascribe to others the erecting, or the procuring to be erected, of more ramparts and moles than might have accorded with the taste of Wykeham, who was as peaceful as he was princely, we question whether we could find, designed by another architect of the same period, any hall of simple habitation so magnificent as this ; or one in which the windows are so judiciously adapted to the size of the apartment. These windows, as they appear in the ruin, are five in number, of ample dimensions, with the height z 2"], [214, "172 SOUTHERN SLOPE. \u2014 HISTORICAL and breadth well adjusted to each other, and without the slightest appearance that the inmate had any cause of fear. In the latter part of his life, this was the favourite retreat of Wykeham; and here he closed his most meritorious, honourable, and exceedingly active life, at the advanced age of eighty. This palace, in common with many other splen- did buildings of the olden times, was destroyed during the civil wars, and no attempt has been since made to repair it. In later times, the ruins have been more respected than those of many other ancient structures, \u2014 even than those of Wolvesey itself; which, though at one time an embattled castle, from within which a bishop could defy the menaces of royal armies, has been used by bishops of more recent date, as a quarry whence to obtain materials for repairing the highways. Though the palace is said to have been originally built by Bishop Henry, and to have been re-built, renovated, and demolished, at the periods we have mentioned; yet, according to the account in Doomsday Book, it should seem that the chace and manor of Waltham had belonged to the bishops of Winchester from their earliest creation ; for in the notice, taken of it in that general summary of the country, it is added, that it belonged to the bishop ; which is a proof that, at the time when Doomsday Book was drawn up, it had been so long in the possession of the said bishops that the time or manner of its passing into their hands was not then remembered. At present it remains in ruins, clad with ivy, and the courts and park have been turned to the most ordinary purposes of rural economy. The town of Bishop's Waltham is not very large, though sufficiently so for an agricultural one. In 1831, the population of the town and parish amounted to 2181, and the rental is estimated at 4809/. The chief occupation of the inhabitants is in agriculture, and in the supply of ordinary shop articles to the surrounding districts. Like some of the other country towns in Hampshire, it has extensive manufactories of malt \u2014 if maltvmaking can. be called a manufacture ; and there is also a good deal of leather tanned and prepared in the town."], [215, "173 AND TOPOGRAPHICAL DETAILS. The streets, though not spacious, are clean ; but, though the population has been increasing of late years, some of the streets afford evidence of having seen better days. Two public thoroughfares intersect each other in Bishop's Wal tham, \u2014 the one, the road from London to Southampton through Alton; and the other, the road from Portsmouth through Winchester to Salisbury and the west of England ; but neither of these is the main or most frequented road joining the great towns at its extremities. Bishop's Wal tham has a weekly market on Saturdays, at which a good deal of corn is sold ; and it has four general markets or fairs in the course of the year, \u2014 namely, one on the second Friday of May, another on the thirtieth day of July, a third on the first Friday after old Michaelmas, and a fourth on the tenth day of October. The church, which is a venerable and ra ther handsome structure, dedicated to St. Peter \u2014 and with the rectory, in the gift of the bishop of Winchester \u2014 is situated on a rising ground toward the north part of the town. There is also a free-school, and some charities of minor importance ; but it does not appear that any of the bishops endowed any institution of much importance at this their ancient and regular hunting-seat: We also find no trace of any religious house having existed here, either for male or female devo tees ; which seems to imp}y that the bishops were not partial to the presence of monks or nuns in the immediate neigh bourhood of their sporting lodge. At rather more than a mile to the south of Bishop's Wal tham, two feeders of the Hamble come in, \u2014 one from the east and the other from the west ; and as each of these is larger than the stream which they join, the river becomes of some magnitude. Before these branches of the river join, the chalk disappears from the surface, which then presents, in different places, all the varieties of the tertiary formation, from the most retentive clay to the loosest sand, \u2014 the last sometimes rising into knolls, the soil upon which is exceed ingly barren ; while the stiff clay, when it occupies any breadth of flat surface, is apt to retain stagnant water, and not only to be unpleasant in itself, but to render the air"], [216, "174 SOUTHERN SLOPE. HISTORICAL unhealthy. This is most apt to be the case about the middle distance between the chalk heights, on the north of the dis trict, and the sandy heights, toward the Southampton Water. There is some reason to believe that, in the early times, a considerable extent of surface, on both sides of the river for a few miles below Bishop's Waltham, was covered by a close and miry forest ; for there is no house, church, or village on the left bank in the entire course to the sea ; and only the single parish church of Durley on the right bank, until Botley is arrived at. Durley has a population of 361, and a rental of 1263/. The living is a curacy, which goes along with the rectory of Upham, already noticed. Botley is of some consideration as a village, although a good deal of the land belonging to the parish is either very poor, or consists of strong wet clay. The rental, accordingly, is not high in proportion to the number of inhabitants, which is 722, while the rental is only 1660/. A considerable por tion of the inhabitants reside in the village, which has a corn market held on a Wednesday. There is besides a flour trade here, the mills being convenient and the river navigable ; it has also a cattle market held on every alternate Monday. Botley is in fact the port of the Hamble, which, as a river, is navigable for a greater length than any other in the county. The only remaining parishes in this natural section are Bursledon, Hound, and Hamble. Bursledonis on the right bank of the river, about three miles further down than Botley. The parish is a curacy attached to the rectory of Hound; it contains 510 inhabitants, and has a rental of 1028/. The village, which is near the bank of the river, is very straggling and irregular ; but it is convenient for ship-building, though nothing is regularly done in that way. At one time some government ships of considerable burden were built here. Hound lies about a mile further to the westward ; and, although the population is less, the rent is more than double. The rental is 2672, and the number of people 417. Hamble, or Hamble-en-le-Rice, is on the right of the mouth of the river; it has a population of 318, and the yearly value is under 1000/. The vicarage goes along"], [217, "Wttitiu-stn . Publuhed to\\ t/u Proprietor \u25a0<<<' Robbltu, CoRega Street, lu, D.\u00a3 Gil -c. htblie \u00a30nuy.

The two parishes are, in great part, situated upon the dry and sandy portion of part of the tertiary deposit, which forms the sterile and naked heaths and commons, both eastward and westward of the Hamble ; and which destroys the natural fertility of that portion of the district which lies immediately along the northern margin of the narrow sea to the westward of the Titchfield river. II. District from the valley of Meon to the MOUTH OF THE TlTCHFIELD RIVER. This district Or valley is more remarkable for its length than its breadth, the latter being in most jplaces inconsiderable. The pa rish of East Meon occupies the upper part of this valley ; and the rectory has the curacies of Froxfield and Steep attached. It is a large parish, with a population of 1681, and a rental of 8694/. The village, which is upon the bank of the stream, is a little metropolis in its way, hav ing a neat old church, built in the form of a cross, with a Norman tower; and the old fount is very nearly a fac simile of that in the cathedral of Winchester. This fount is understood to have been presented by Bishop Walkelin, who, as is noticed in the first volume of this work, was the first Norman re-builder of the cathedral ; and the splendid and substantial style of whose architecture is still perfect in the tower and the transepts, \u2014 though the latter have been very much disfigured by the parsimonious and tasteless repairs of modern times. This bishop is understood to have founded and built the church of East Meon. There is also an endowed school in the village. West Meon is a smaller parish, and situated in a place where the heights on the north and south approach more closely to each other. It has a population of 711, and a rental of 2186/. The curacy of Privet is annexed to the rectory of West Meon ; these two parishes occupy what may be termed the valley of Meon, which, with the continuation down the river to where the forests used to close in upon it on both sides, appears to have been well peopled in very early times ; and it is pro bable that some of the battles, whose scenes are marked by"], [220, "176 SOUTHERN SLOPE. \u2014 HISTORICAL the barrows upon Kilmeston down, may have been fought in defence of the habitations and the agricultural wealth of this valley. Warnford, the next parish, has already been noticed as situated at the bend where the course of the river turns to the south, and immediately between the Beacon hill on the west and Old Winchester hill on the south-east. This parish has a population of 418, and a rental of 2708/. In the garden at Warnford house, on the left bank of the river, there are the ruins of an ancient building, of great extent. As is often the case with buildings, the real erectors of which are not known, this has been popularly named King John's house, though it does not appear that King John had any thing to do with it. Report says, that it was built, between the years 679 and 685, by Wilfred, bishop of York, during which period he took refuge among the West Saxons. If so, this is one of the oldest ruins in England. That Wilfred should have built a mansion of the dimensions which the ruins indicate, during his sojourn of six years in this part of the country is not probable; and though he had, it is not likely that the same structure would have remained during nearly 1200 years. From some ancient inscriptions, it would appear that Wilfred founded the church of Warn ford ; and that the same was renovated by the celebrated Adam de Port, sometime in the twelfth century. De Port was one of the most powerful barons in this part of England, in the reigns of Henry II, of Richard, and of John; and though Warnford may not have been his principal residence \u2014 for the De Ports had many manors in the country from the time of the Conquest \u2014 it certainly was one of them ; but whether the ruins be those of a building erected by De Port or by some one else, it is impossible to say. It does, how ever, appear to be Norman, for the arches of the windows are circular ; and it is by much too old for the modern introduction of that form. The part that remains is about 84 feet long, and 54 wide, with walls, of flints and hard mortar, about four feet thick. It has consisted of two apart ments, \u2014 a larger in the east end and a smaller in the west."], [221, "177 AND TOPOGRAPHICAL DETAILS. It appears to have had an arched roof, supported by pillars, and a painted one once. The form does not answer to that of a church ; and the probability is, that it may have been a banqueting hall ; but conjectures respecting it are of little avail. In a land of ruined castles this would not meet with much notice. Below Warnford, the three parish churches of Corhamp ton, Exton, and Meon Stoke, are situated within little more than half-a-mile of each other, \u2014 in fact the villages of Cor hampton and Meon Stoke are almost continuations of one village. Exton contains 283 inhabitants, and has a rental of 2146/. ; Corhampton has 125 people, with a rental of 1293 /. ; and Meon Stoke has a rental of 1234/. ; and 382 inhabitants. Thus, all the three parishes taken together have neither so many inhabitants, nor so large a rental as the single parish of East Meon. Corhampton is a curacy, but Exton and Meon Stoke are rectories, with the curacy of Soberton annexed to the latter. Soberton is an extensive parish, with a rental of 3308/., and a population of 951. Droxford, on the opposite bank of the river \u2014 the right bank. and about midway between Meon Stoke and Soberton, is much more populous than either of the others, but the rental is smaller. It contains 1620 people, and the rental is only 2268/., which is more like a town rental than one in a country parish. The living is a rectory and the bishop of Winchester is patron. Below Droxford, the remain of the forest of Bere ap proaches the river on the left, and Waltham chase approaches it on the east ; there are accordingly no churches or other ancient establishments, till we come to Wickham, which is a large and populous parish, with 1106 inhabitants, and a rental of 4578/. The village is of considerable extent, situ ated on the high road from Winchester to Gosport, and near where the Roman road passed. It has been a place of some note from remote times, has an annual fair in May, and courts leet and baron every year. It derives its chief celebrity, however, from being the native place of William VOL. II. A A"], [222, "178 SOUTHERN SLOPE \u2014 HISTORICAL of Wykeham, who was born here in 1324. This very illus- trious man was the son of parents in a humble station of life. His father's name was John Long, and his mother's Christian name Sibil or Sybil. His manners and talents when a boy, attracted the attention of Nicholas Uvedale, the then lord of the manor of Wickham, by whom he was sent to school at Winchester, then one of the best semina- ries in the country ; and from Winchester, the same gentle- man sent him to Oxford, After he had been there for six years, he was recalled by Mr. Uvedale, who was at that time constable of Winchester castle, and to whom he acted as secretary. Bishop Edington employed him in the same capacity, and ultimately obtained permission to have him en- tirely in his service. His principal forte appears to have been architecture and mechanics ; and when Edward III visited Winchester, he gave Wykeham a patent as surveyor of the royal castles and other buildings ; and parts of Dover, Wind- sor, and several other castles were built under his superin- tendence. From this situation, while yet comparatively a young man, he successively rose to the offices of secreta- ry of state, keeper of the privy seal, and chancellor ; and he became bishop of Winchester on the 10th of October, 1367. The situations which Wykeham held, enabled him to accumulate great wealth, though he does not appear to have been in any way fond of property, and his munificence was very great. All his relations appear to have adopted his assumed name of Wykeham, with the same avidity that the Celts of the Scotch Highlands adopted the names of the Norse adventurers that landed on their shores. Wyke- ham found all the ecclesiastical buildings in a state of di- lapidation ; and instantly took the most vigorous measures for having them repaired or re-built. Scarcely any man ever led so active a life ; and he was equally splendid and successful in all his undertakings, which were probably on a more extensive scale, according to the fashion of the times, than were ever planned and carried into execution by any other man in England. There is no evidence that he ever"], [223, "179 AND TOPOGRAPHICAL DETAILS. oppressed any human being, or ever extorted a single penny from any man. On the contrary, he was kind and gene rous in the extreme ; and appeared ready to improve the condition of the people by every means that a mind of the most enlarged capacity could devise. There were few spots in the diocese which did not in some way profit by his bounty ; and at his death, the legacies he left as tokens of regard, showed how large the circle of his friends was, and how much he was attached to them. His most conspicu ous memorials, are his colleges at Winchester and Oxford ; but these, though the most splendid, are only two out of very many. One thing is worthy of notice in the splendid career of Wykeham : from the time that the boy attracted the attention of Uvedale, to that at which the great bishop of Winchester resigned his spirit, on Saturday, the 27th of September, 1404, it does not appear that he solicited any one step of the innumerable preferments which were heaped upon him ; or that he, upon any one occasion, played the courtier. His talents appear to have commanded and con trolled everything; and he seems to have got all his ap pointments from no other cause than that he was better qualified than any other man for discharging, with honour to himself and with the best advantage to individuals and to his country, each and every duty to the performance of which he was appointed. Though he had filled the highest and most confidential situations in the service of the king, it does not appear that he was, in any way, a worshipper of royalty ; and though he held so high an office in the church, he was so far from having any dependance on the patronage of the Pope, that he stood manfully up for the rights of the Church of England, when they were menaced from that quarter. Take him in all the phases of his most active character, and the conclusion at which one arrives is, that there have been few men equal to William of Wykeham, and none superior to him ; so that the village in which he was born, and which he honoured by adopting its name as a A 2"], [224, "180 SOUTHERN SLOPE. \u2014 HISTORICAL his own, will continue to be proud of his memory. But while we attempt \u2014 no man can fully succeed \u2014 to do justice to Wykeham, we must not forget Nicholas Uvedale ; but for whom the great talents of Wykeham might have been lost to the world. Below Wickham, the only other place of note on the banks of this river is Titchfield, within about two miles of the sea. Titchfield is a marketvtown, the market being held every Friday, and there are four fairs in the course of the year. The population is 3742, and the rental 12,017/., which for a town is a high rental in proportion to the population. The town, for the number of inha bitants, is not large; but it is neat, and there are many respectable people resident in it. It is not, in strict lan guage, a sea-port, but vessels of small burden can ascend the entrance of the river. That this is a pleasant spot may be inferred from the fact that an abbey for Premonstratensi um canons was founded here in 1231, by Rupibus, bishop of Winchester. This abbey remained till the dissolution, after which time, it was given by Henry VIII to Sir Tho mas Wraithesly, his secretary, who was afterwards called baron of Titchfield. By him the abbey was demolished, anel the material employed in building Titchfield house upon the same site ; and the house has in its turn become a ruin. This house has some name in history from being the place in which Charles I was concealed after his flight from Hamp ton court in 1647 ; and it was from hence that he was car ried by Colonel Hammond and others to the Isle of Wight. The chapelry of Crofton lies to the left of the river, between Titchfield and the sea. It is a curacy included in the parish of Titchfield, the rector of which has the appointment of the curate. The land in this part of the district is comparatively flat ; and though there are clumps of planted trees there, the quantity of wood is not great. The soil is in general fertile ; and, from the small elevation of the surface and its proximity to the sea, the climate is favourable for the growth of vegetables."], [225, "i ' J ft S I M D tUI ii E , ru'fii /\u25a0\u25a0ifi.ii lt,t,,l..:,l,,: h,/.l,.,l,.;/ /;.,\u25a0 H., I;,./,r,,l\u201er J,,.'

Between Portsdown and the forest of Bere. This section, as formerly noticed, is about six miles in length and two or three in breadth. It contains the parishes of Boarhunt, Southwick, and Widley. Its surface has a gen tle slope from east to west ; and the small river which falls into the creek of Portsmouth harbour, meanders westward and nearly along the centre of it. Boarhunt, the most west erly of the three parishes, lies partly on the north-western slope of Portsdown ; and the surface is in many parts bare. The population is 255, and the rental 1744/. The village, which is small, is about two miles north-east of Fareham. Southwick parish is much larger, and more populous ; the rental being 4602/., and the population 723. It has also some note or name in history. A priory of black canons was founded here in the reign of Henry I. The same ca nons had been previously established at Porchester; but they were transferred to Southwick, where they continued till the abolition. The priory was in a fine rural situation ; and, from the freedom of forests and other means of keeping a good larder, which the brethren enjoyed, their abode became a favourite resort for pious pilgrims : and Henry VI was here married to Margaret of Anjou. At the dissolution, the priory and manor passed to John White, Esq., whose monument still remains in the church; and after, it belonged to the Nor ton family, and was the seat of the brave Colonel Norton, in the time of the civil war. Charles I was at Southwick when Felton stabbed his favourite Buckingham at Portsmouth ; upon hearing of which, the gallant monarch instantly return ed to London. The publicans in this place are exempted from having soldiers billeted upon them, which exemption appears to have been handed down from the time of the monks, whose charter gave them plenery exemption from all kinds of mo lestation. Widley, \" the wooded place,\" in part still merits the name, as there is a great deal of timber both in this and the adjoining part of Southwick; and there seems no reason to doubt that, when the forest was at the full extent, timber was more plentiful in all the places aeljoining. Widley con-"], [230, "182 SOUTHERN SLOPE. \u2014 HISTORICAL tains a population of 512, and the rental is 2347/. The rectory is held jointly with that of Wymering on the south side of the Portsdown ridge. Purbrook, on the Portsmouth road, is the largest village in this parish. IV. North of the forest of Bere. This section, taken eastward to the summit-level from Portsdown to But ser hill, which does not vary much from the line ofthe road to Petersfield, is nearly a square of about five miles in the side ; and it contains the three parishes of Hambledon, Clanfield, and Catherington. Hambledon is a large parish, containing between 7000 and 8000 acres of surface, in which there is a considerable breadth of sheep down and forest land on the south. The rental is 6393/. and the population 2026. Ham bledon though small, is a market town, having a market every Thursday, in which a great deal of business is done in corn. It has also three fairs in the course of the year. The extreme north of the parish consists chiefly of open downs ; in the middle there are light lands, of easy cultivation and well adapted for turnip husbandry ; and in the southern part, toward the forest, the land is stiff and heavy, consisting in great part of strong clays. The village of Clanfield is about a mile to the left of the road to Petersfield, and three miles south-west of Butser hill. Much of the surface is open ; but in the lower part of the parish there is a considerable extent of good land. The population is 529, and the rental 3357/. A considerable proportion of the inhabitants reside in the village. Catherington is situated about a mile and a half directly south of Clanfield and rather nearer the high road. It is a more populous parish, and being further from the downs, is upon the whole richer. The number of peo ple is 944, and the rental 4299/. The village is long and straggling, but it contains great part of the inhabitants. There are no vestiges of religious buildings in this section of the county ; which appears not to have much to attract the holy men of the olden times. V. District on the border of Sussex. This is in some respects a peculiar district, having its surface very"], [231, "183 AND TOPOGRAPHICAL DETAILS. much diversified by undulations, and its soil composed of many varieties of land, from the almost absolute sterility of the northern downs, to the most fertile on the shores of Langston harbour. The parishes of Chalton, Idsworth, and Blindworth, are situated on the northern or upland part ; and these are divided from the coast counties by a con siderable breadth of waste and woodland of a clayey nature, which stretches eastward from the forest of Bere. Chalton is situated principally on the downs; and may be considered as one of the least productive parishes in the county. It contains 550 people, while the rent is only 752/., which is remarkably low for a country parish, where the people can have little or no employment but in the fields. Idsworth, about two miles south of Chalton, is of superior quality ; and, with not above two-thirds of the population, can afford to pay three times the rent. Population 315, rent 2203/. The church and the grounds of Idsworth house are close on the boundary of the county. There has been fighting here at some time ; for there are many tumuli upon Idsworth down, to the north-west of the village. Blendworth, situ ated about a mile and a half to the south-west of Idsworth, extends a considerable way into the cold forest land. It has a population of 246, and a rental of 1441/. The parishes toward the sea are, as has been said, much superior in point of soil to those on the north of the forest. There are three of them on the mainland, \u2014 Bedhampton, Ha vant, and Warblington, the last including the village of Ems worth, on the margin of the county ; and in Hayling island, there are two parishes, North and South. Bedhampton lies around the eastern termination of Portsdown, the richest land being between that elevation and the sea. The parish extends over about 3000 acres, for which a rental of 3317/. is paid, and the population is estimated at 537. About half the surface is under tillage, and the other half is about equally occupied by pasture and woodland. The church is a very neat structure ; the climate of the parish is very mild ; and, which is rather rare in Hampshire, it abounds in springs"], [232, "184 SOUTHERN SLOPE. \u2014 HISTORICAL of water, some of them impregnated with minerals \u2014 chiefly, we believe, with iron. The parish of Havant is a liberty, bounded on the land sides by Bedhampton and Warblington, and on the south by Langston harbour. The market town and parish contain in all 2083 inhabitants, and the rental is 6229/. The town is neatly built, consisting chiefly of two principal streets, one north and south, and another east and west ; the public road between Portsmouth and the more easterly part of the south coast passing along the latter. In former times, the fishery in Langston harbour used to be productive, but it is now inconsiderable, except the oyster fishery, which is still of some note. The mildness of the climate, and the number and richness of the mud-banks, occasion the resort of num bers of migrant aquatic birds to this harbour, especially when the winter is severe ; and, among others, a swan, with a collar purporting that the bird belonged to the king of Denmark, was shot here in the winter of 1739. In Oc tober, 1834, a slight shock of an earthquake was felt, but without the slightest disruption of the surface. These deep-seated earthquakes, of which slight shocks are felt oc casionally in almost all parts of England, show that there is an action constantly going on ; and they are probably at tended by slight elevations and depressions of some parts of the surface. The church is a handsome structure, with round pillars in the early Norman style. It consists of an aisle and chancel, with transepts, and a Norman tower over the intersection. Warblington lies on the east and north-east of Havant. It consists for the most part of rich and fertile land. The rental is 4990/., and the population 2218, .a considerable number of whom reside in the village of Emsworth. The village has a harbour for small craft; and there are two fairs in the course of the year. The castle of the lords of the manor of Warblington, was once a place of some note in this part of the country. The ruins are about half-a-mile to the eastward of Havant ; and the place has once been"], [233, "w ava n T ili'i.A.../.! Publis/ud foi (Ai Proprietor las.

The brick building, lined with stone, of which a small portion now remains, is not of very ancient date. The parish church is not far from the site of the old castle. There is a local tradition, that this church was originally founded by some two pious ladies ; but this does not appear to rest upon any conclusive evidence. Besides the decay of the fishery, the inhabitants of this part of the coast, are subject to other fallings-off from their oc- cupations. Before the rock-salt of Cheshire and Worcester- shire was worked to such an extent, the salterns on these shores were of considerable value ; but now they are of no consideration. In time of war, too, a fictitious population was drawn toward these places, in expectation of employ- ment in the government works ; and of course when peace comes, the numbers of the people do not decrease so fast as the demand for their services. So many years have, how- ever, elapsed since the late war, that by this time the po- pulation must have nearly found its level ; and the people being cut off from the hope of fictitious means of subsis tence, will of course cultivate the natural and proper re sources of their own locality. Hayling Island is but little elevated above those arms of the sea by which it is surrounded. Its length is about three miles and a half ; its breadth very irregular ; and its surface about 5000 acres, of which about 3000 are cul tivated, half the remainder in pasture, and the rest sludgy and covered by the sea at high tides. The shores are every where so muddy, and the water so shallow, that there is no creek or harbour. The communication with the mainland, is by boats, or by the wooden bridge opposite the village of Langston ; the ford can be passed at low water. The popu lation of the whole island is 882, and the entire rental is 4776/. It is divided into two parishes, South Hayling, with a population of 588, and a rental of 2783/. ; and North Hayling, with 294 people, and 1993/. rent. There was a VOL. II. BB"], [238, "186 SOUTHERN SLOPE. \u2014 DETAILS. priory on the island before the Conquest ; but the revenues were speedily given to an abbey in Normandy. When the alien priories were suppressed, it was bestowed upon the Carthusians at Sheen ; and it so continued till the dissolu tion, when, after some exchanges and transfers, it ultimately became the property of the Norfolk family. The greater part of the rich land about Portsmouth was church property in the early times. As the climate along the whole of these very sinuous shores is mild, the sea breeze fresh over the whole of the island in the summer season, and yet not so piercing as that which comes over a large extent of sea, and impruges directly upon a bold and cliffy shore, many families and invalids resort to the island, so that the accommodation, and at least the fluctuating population, have of late years consi derably increased."], [239, ""], [240, "ENVIRONS OF PORTSMOUTH."], [241, "187 SOUTHERN SLOPE. \u2014 PORTSEA ISLAND. CHAPTER VIII. SOUTHERN SLOPE. \u2014 PORTSEA ISLAND. Under this general title, we shall include that small but very important section of the county of Hants, which lies to the southward of Portsdown ridge, that is to say, from Bedhampton on the east, along the ridge of the down, so as to include the town of Fareham below its western termi nation, which is an extent rather more than seven miles. The eastern boundary may be regarded as following the course of the main channel of Langston harbour, southward to Cumberland fort ; and this, from the upper tide way to the entrance, is about five miles. These boundaries as well as the southern one, which is the line of the sea, are defined by nature. The western boundary is also partially divined by the tidal brook which extends from Alverstoke north westward for about three or four miles, and then across the fields from Foxbury to Fareham. The land and water within these boundaries are so blended with each other, that it would be in vain to attempt any minute description of them. Portsdown forms a com plete barrier to the view northward, from all the district to the south ; but for this deprivement the tourist is well re paid by the view from the down itself, which is equally ex tensive, diversified, and interesting. The highest part of bb 2"], [242, "188 SOUTHERN SLOPE. the down is little more than four hundred feet above the level of the sea ; and thus, the country seen from it has none of that bird's-eye character, which renders a view tame and flat when looked upon from too great an elevation. The escarpment is also short, and, in favourable states of the tide and the atmosphere, there is much of natural beauty, though the extent is too great for admitting of strong pictorial effect in any artificial delineation. In some respects, this is no inconsiderable advantage ; for it takes much from the interest of a fine view, if every peripatetic artist is able to carry off a type of it in his portfolio ; and the real enjoyment of scenery, which is one of the most de lightful of our enjoyments, begins exactly at that point where the abilities of the artist break down. In order to understand the treat which the view from this chalk ridge affords, the reader has only to look at the map : Suppose he stands at the middle of its length, the mainland part of Hampshire which forms the fore-ground, is within five or six miles distance; and, what with the bays, the towns of Portsmouth and Gosport, the diversi fied surface of the peninsulas and islands, the rich ver dure of the fields and meadows, the luxuriance of the trees, the forest of masts, the anchored vessels at Spithead, which show the naval majesty of England, sleeping on the stilly water, \u2014 what with these, and what with the histori cal and national associations which they conjure up we have a foreground which, both to the eye and to the understand ing, is probably not equalled, and certainly not excelled, by any one within the four seas. Beyond this, at a distance not too great for distinct vision, but which still gains a powerful contrast from the intervening sea, one has the entire length of the Isle of Wight, the So lent, a portion of the Southampton Water, the serried oaks of the New Forest, with a view of the Channel at each end of the island, melting off into the sky, and completing the picture by a very impressive feeling of the extent of the ocean."], [243, "189 PORTSEA ISLAND. Then, as food to the mind, after the eye is saturated, one has the docks and arsenal \u2014 the grand manufactory of the British navy, the fleet ready for sea in the offing, and a channel on either hand by which they can pass to the en tire expanse of that element which, though it obliterates all the common works of man, and shakes and shatters even the rocks themselves, is graven with monuments of England's glory, which time cannot erase. The inland views, though circumscribed towards- the east and north by the Sussex downs and their Hampshire continuation, are still of ample extent, and full of important subjects of historical reminis cences, and pleasing contrasts of landscape, and of the pre sent and former condition of all that presents itself to the eye. The sight from this down, if fully and deliberately taken, is indeed a volume of much interest and instruction. It is certain that detachments at least of all the nations by which south Britain has been successively invaded have effected their landing upon the shores of this district, and conducted their march over its surface. The line of the Roman road can be traced for great part of the distance to Winchester ; and down to recent times, many spots within view have been crowded with armed men. As matters of mere history, these martial movements are not without their interest; but the most pleasing interest is the con trast of the turbulence of the past with the quietude of the present. There may be grandeur in the movements of armies, and the turmoil and din of battles ; and there may be exultation when powerful fleets march on the sea billow and the current of the wind to turn the battle from the gates of England ; but truly there is more of pleasurable and grateful emotion, when every one is dwelling at peace \" under his own vine and his own fig tree, with nothing to make him afraid,\" as has been the case in this district for nearly two hundred years, and of the interruption of which there is now not the slightest prospect. The force of this contrast must be palpable to every one who feels, either simply as a man, or patriotically as an"], [244, "190 SOUTHERN SLOPE. Englishman ; and therefore it is that the summit of this hill of observation is worthy of an hour's visit from every man who wishes to make his own eyes the inlets of know ledge and delight. As we have already said, however, the interest of such places is destroyed by detailed attempts, whether of the pencil or of the pen ; and therefore we merely give the hint, leave the reader to find the enjoyment, and proceed to the more simple work of short topographical de scription. In order to do this as briefly and as clearly as possible, it will be desirable to take the district under con sideration, in subdivisions, of which in this instance there are three, all of which are very natural. They consist of, the country extending along the southern inclination of Portsdown, as far as the high-water line, \u2014 of the land on the west side of Portsmouth harbour, from the town of Fare ham southward to the sea, \u2014 and of the Isle of Portsea, with the town of Portsmouth, and the establishment there and in Gosport. It is true that a considerable portion of the north end of Portsea Isle is included in the parish of Wymering, the remainder of which lies in the first of the three natural divisions ; but still it will be more explicit to regard Port bridge, where Portsmouth and Langston harbour meet, as the descriptive boundary. DECLIVITY OF PORTSDOWN, This natural section is of very small extent, being the length of the down \u2014 or about seven miles, and about one mile in average breadth, \u2014 the breadth in Portchester, where it is greatest, being a mile and a half, and that from the tele graph on the down to Portbridge little more than one mile. Along the margin of the water, the soil is very rich, and considerable portions of it have been, from time to time, gained from the sea. As one ascends the down, it gets gradually thinner, and ultimately passes into chalk; but from its southward slope, and its proximity to the sea, and the extensive harbours with their tidal banks, the whole of it is much more fertile than the character of the soil would"], [245, "191 PORTSEA ISLAND. lead one to suppose, inasmuch as the sea breeze refreshes it with evaporated moisture when the air is warm and dry. In fact, it is a sort of natural forcing-ground, in which both heat and humidity work more intensely than the climate would lead one to suppose. The same character applies to the grounds all the way to the sea ; and this is one reason why some of the more delicate species of culinary vegeta bles thrive much better in the vicinity of Portsmouth, than on almost any other spot in England. The great southern road, through Chichester and Fare ham, passes through the whole district, immediately under the down, and at some parts close to the sea-shore ; and there is another longitudinal road along the summit of the down, which is, however, one of comparatively little traffic. The London road crosses the down two miles west of Bed hampton and near the telegraph ; and, three miles further west, there stands, on the very summit, a monumental tribute to Lord Nelson. If we take the longitudinal road from Bed hampton to Fareham, it will give us the positions of most of the places worthy of notice within the district. Proceed ing westward, one mile brings us to the parish church of Farlington ; another mile, to the village of Drayton : about a third mile to the village of Cosham, on the London road ; half-a-mile more, to the parish church and village of Wy mering ; another mile, to the small village of Palsgrove, on the beach ; another mile still, to the northern termination of the parish of Portchester, which straggles south-easterly for very nearly a mile, and terminates at the once stately castle of Portchester ; another mile brings one to the small village of East Cams ; and, half-a-mile more, to the bridge across the creek which forms the harbour of Fareham. \u2014 Such are the positions of the places ; and we shall now notice, in greater detail, such of them as may appear to warrant that distinction. Farlington is a parish containing about 780 inhabitants ; and, by the returns, of the yearly value of nearly 4000/. The living is a rectory in the diocese and archdeaconry of"], [246, "192 SOUTHERN SLOPE. Winchester, and under lay patronage: The village of Cos ham, being at the intersection ofthe two great roads, contains a good many houses ; and there are one or two small vil lages in the neighbourhood. The parish of Wymering is valuable, in proportion to its inhabitants ; the yearly esti mate being 7393/., and the number of inhabitants 580. The living is a vicarage in conjunction with the rectory of Widley ; and a portion of the Island of Portsea, and also the small islands of Great and Little Horsea are included in this parish. Hilsea barracks, together with a considerable number of houses, are situated in this parish ; but there is no remain of antiquity worthy of notice, nor any very im portant modern erection or establishment in any of the parishes hitherto noticed. With Portchester, the case is different. As a parish, its yearly value, in proportion to the number of its inhabitants, is lower than that of Wymering, \u2014 the former being 4631/., and the latter 739 ; but it has been a place of importance from the earliest records of history ; and the ruins of its castle, which has been a stronghold to many parties, are still of interest, though chiefly in a monumental point of view. Porchester Castle \u2014 which is obviously a softened or thography of Portchester, which again is merely a corrup tion of Castrum Portu, is described as having been a place of strength in the time of the Britons, \u2014 or probably rather of the Belgic tribes who settled in this part of the country, and to whom Portsmouth harbour appears to have been the grand place of landing, and probably of traffic by sea for this part of England, as there is no vestige of a Belgic fort on any other part of the adjoining waters. Caer Peris is un derstood to have been the appellation bestowed by them upon whatever description of stronghold they erected upon this point. When the Romans obtained possession, and constructed a castle after their fashion upon the same point, they also looked upon Portsmouth harbour as the place of most accommodation for their galleys. For this reason,"], [247, "P'O CASTILE. lit,,, \u25a0/\u201e.,!,, I;,l,t':.,l,,,l !,\u201e\u25a0,/\u201e ji,.,.,,,/,., ./\u201e\u2022 /:\u201e/,/\u201e\u201e, , t\u201e//,.r .,/,-,,/,"], [248, ""], [249, "193 PORTSEA ISLAND. they called it Port us magnus, or the great port; and the name of the castle or place of strength, in which case the epithet \" magnus \" was dropped in speaking of the castle only, and the substantive Portus, was changed to the epi thet of the castle ; or, when they were spoken of together, and the castle alluded to as an appendage to the harbour, Portus Castri, was the name applied. When the Saxons overcame the Romanised Britons, they changed the name to their own pronunciation, Chester or cestre ; and from this the name has been retained to modern times. This castle was at the commencement of the great Ro- man road leading through Winchester to Oki Sarum ; and the fact of this being the main line from the sea is proved by the roads from Bitterne and Nutshalling being merely lateral branches meeting the main line at Winchester. Even in their days, tbe place had been one of considerable di- mensions as well as importance ; and the same site appears to have been occupied by all the parties who held it in suc- cession. In ancient times, the situation of this castle must have been strong, as it stands on the extremity of a penin- sula, jutting into the harbour, and thus requiring defences against the inland people only upon the land side. The area of the castle within the walls is between four and five acres, and the outward walls are evidently the only parts which are of Roman erection. These walls have been about ten feet in thickness, on the average, though variable in some places ; and they have averaged about eighteen feet in height. In many parts of the remains, the Roman style of building, consisting of grouted rubble with bonding courses of brick, may still be observed ; but the buildings of the keep are evidently later than the days ofthe Romans, and some of them are comparatively modern. It is under- stood that the present parish church is situated on that part of the pr\u00e6torium, whereon stood the temple or church of the garrison in the time of the Romans. The walls are flanked with tow7ers at the north-east, south-east, and south. west angles ; but at the north-west angle, the round tower VOL. II. cc"], [250, "194 SOUTHERN SLOPE. of the Saxons has been removed to make room for one of the towers of the keep. This keep occupies an oblong, sixty-five feet the one way, and a hundred the other ; and, when entire, it has consisted of the towers alluded to, with strong curtains between them, all of very solid masonry. The great tower is of vari ous styles of architecture, from the days of the Saxons to those of Queen Elizabeth. \u2014 But the ruins are so extensive that we cannot enter into details. The history of this castle is, in the early part, involved in some obscurity, the chroniclers saying that it was built by Gurgunstus 300 years before the birth of Christ. It is probable that this is a mere fable, inasmuch as the said chroniclers had a great tendency to \" make a beginning \" to everything whether they had any real authority for so doing or not. This was a royal castle in the years im mediately following the conquest ; but the kings appear to have had some trouble in making the constables behave in a manner exactly proper. In those days, every man who held a strong castle, by whatever tenure, appeareel to have as sumed not a little of royal authority, which was indeed quite in the spirit of feudal law. As an example of this, we find that, in the year 1290, when John de Pontissara, bi shop of Winchester, was abroad, Henry Huse, the then con stable of Portchester, \" took his pleasure \" in Waltham chase, with as much freedom as Percy of Northumberland did in the \" Scottish woods,\" upon the memorable occasion of Chevy Chace ; and that they, the said Huse and his \" merry men all,\" conceiving themselves to be in the protection of the king, set the episcopal keepers at open defiance. What was the result of this complaint is not known ; but nine years afterwards Edward I, who was the very antipodes of Henry VIII, in his coneluct to queens, bestowed this castle upon his second wife, Margaret, as part of her dowry. After this, the castle passed through various hands, until it at length was held by subjects ; and appears at one time to have been, partially at least, the property of the abbey of"], [251, "195 PORTSEA ISLAND. Glassenbury. It subsequently became private property, and in war time it has been extensively used as a place of con finement for prisoners. We have noticed in a former chapter that the priory of black canons, established here by Henry I, was removed to Southwick ; but the church, which is probably of more an cient date than the priory, still remains, occupying the south eastern part of the castle area. It is a homely structure, in various styles of architecture, and has undergone many alterations, as is evident from the marks on the tower of roofs of much greater elevation than the present one. The living is a vicarage, of which the lord chancellor is patron. The village of Porchester, extending from the castle to the public road, for about a mile, used to be called Porches ter-street; and the street which now passes through it is most probably part of the great Roman road. Situated at a distance from the road, not being a thoroughfare, and also being near to Fareham, and having no harbour, this village is of no great importance. WESTWARD OF PORTSMOUTH HARBOUR. This natural section of the district is of very irregular figure, \u2014 that which it most resembles is an elongated pear. Its greatest length, from Gilkicker point to the most north erly buildings in the town of Fareham, being a little more than six miles ; and this passes very nearly through the average axis, or centre line of that area. The greatest breadth is about two miles ; and the average may be about a mile and a half, which will make the whole surface equal to about nine square miles. A considerable portion of this, however, consists of creeks, tidal banks, marshy banks, and water-meadows, \u2014 the creeks in this part of the county being styled lakes, or ponds. The surface, though a little diver sified by hill and dale, is in general flat, and the soil rich and highly productive. Viewed from the top of the down, its appearance at high-water is very fine ; and in the part immediately opposite Portsmouth there is an abundant po< cc 2"], [252, "196 SOUTHERN SLOPE. pulation. The principal part of it is under crop or in pas turage ; but there are some woods and numerous villages. There is no thoroughfare between any very important places through it ; and its principal landward communication is by way of Fareham. From Fareham, a main road extends southward through the middle of the district ; and there are various cross roads within it, but there is no main road intersecting it from east to west, neither is there any regular shipping place along its seaward coast, by means of which an intercourse with the Isle of Wight can be carried on. That coast consists of two lines nearly straight, each about a mile and three quarters in length ; one extending north eastward, from the extreme southerly point to Block-house point on the west entrance to Portsmouth harbour ; and the other exteneling north-westward from the extreme point to opposite Gorner pond, and forming a slight inbend, which is called Stokes bay. The places of most note within it are, Fareham, in the extreme north ; Rowner, toward the west ; Alverstoke, near the south ; with the town of Gos port, which, though situated in the parish of Alverstoke, is the most populous, and in some respects the most important place in the section \u2014 although it derives its chief import ance from being a sort of appendage to Portsmouth, and con taining many of the establishments connected with the government harbour, docks, and arsenal there; and for this reason we shall reserve our notice of them to the next section. Fareham is a market-town, having a weekly market on Wednesdays, and a public fair on the 29th of June yearly. It carries on a considerable trade, and has manufactures of pottery, sacking, cordage, and various other articles. Its population, by the returns in 1831, was 4402, which is an increase of about twenty per cent, upon the previous return ; and if it has gone on at the same rate, which there is every reason to believe, it must now contain more than 5000 in habitants. The yearly valuation in 1815, was 21,088/., which was very high in respect of the population. The"], [253, "WES .,;:\u25a0: HI ASM Bv VE.&ilmaur BiAiic library //\u201e//, Street"], [254, ""], [255, "PORTSEA ISLAND. 197 town has a court baron, under the management of a bailiff, two constables, and two ale-conners. The church living is a vicarage, in the patronage of the bishop of Winchester ; and, besides the parish church, there are meeting houses for dissenters. Though Fareham, like Gosport, owed its first growth to a town to its proximity to Portsmouth, it is far less depen dant upon Portsmouth for a continuation of its trade and prosperity. Though it is comparatively small, there are few towns in Hampshire, or indeed in England, more pleasantly or more advantageously situated. It is a great thoroughfare by land, and the sea-port to a very extensive district. For local trade, it is indeed much better situated than Ports mouth itself. There is only one land connection with Ports mouth, namely, that by the London road, or turning from that into the cross roads ; but upon looking at Fareham in the map, it will be seen that it is a point of convergence for several roads ; namely, the road from Alverstoke and Gosport, the road from Southampton, the road from the east, and a road from Bishop's Waltham, which proceeds by one branch to London and the centre of England, and by ano ther to Winchester, Salisbury, and the west of England ; be sides this it is the port from which the extensive country to the southward of the central downs of Hampshire can be best supplied with coal and other sea-borne articles; and also from which the produce of that country can be most con veniently sent to market by sea. Besides these advantages, the situation and environs of the town are very beautiful. Portsdown shelters it from the east and north-east winels, and the force of the south-west winds is also much broken, first by the New Forest and the Isle of Wight, and then by the wooded district south-west of the town. Hence the air has all the freshness of a sea air, without any of its fury ; and consequently Fareham is a most advantageous place of resort for those who wish to enjoy the advantage of sea bathing. Here they have ineleed a double advantage, for they can enjoy the sea and the land at the same time, the"], [256, "198 SOUTHERN SLOPE. town being both maritime and inland. Its distance from the entrance to Portsmouth harbour, along the line of the main channel, is about seven miles ; there is considerable depth of water all the way \u2014 quite enough, indeed, for any vessel that could be expected to carry on a profitable trade with the town ; and there are so many flexures in the upper part, that it has all the appearance of a series of lakes. Many ships of considerable burden have been built at Fare ham ; and timber, fit for ship building, is plentiful in that district to which it forms the port. The town is situated on the right or western bank of the creek, and consists of two principal streets, one stretching along the road to Bi shop's Waltham, and the other along that to Titchfield. Taking it in all its circumstances, Fareham is one of the most agreeable towns in the county. From Fareham southward till about the middle of the length of the section, there are few villages of any magni tude ; but between three and four miles along the Gosport road, there is the village of Brockhurst ; about half-a-mile on the left, at this place, there is the pretty large village of Elson ; and at about nearly a mile to the right stands the parish church of liowner. This is an agricultural and grazing parish, containing a population of 140, which is an increase of only two from 1829 to 1830. The yearly valu ation is 2265/. The church living is a rectory, under pri vate patronage. Alverstoke, independently of its containing the market town of Gosport, is a parish of more interest. Including the town, the population is 12,639 ; and the yearly valua ation in 1815 was 41,440/. The surface of this parish is very much diversified by land and water ; Alverstoke lake enters from Block-house point ; thence, following the wind ings up to the village of Alverstoke, it is about two miles ; and there are two or three branches which extend north westward, and contract the ground upon which Gosport stands to a sort of peninsula.

At rather more than a mile to the northward there is the entrance of Forton lake, which penetrates about a mile and a quarter westward into the land ; between the entrances of these lakes Gosport is situated, and also the naval brewery and some other government works. A ditch and rampart, nearly a mile in length, have been formed from the one of these lakes to the other. These constitute the land boundary of Gosport, properly so called ; but there are many buildings without the lines both on the road by Forton to Fareham, and on the road to Alverstoke. On Priddy's hard, at the north side of the entrance, there are also government works, and these are defended on the land side by a similar ditch and rampart. There are some vil lages in the western parts of the parish, but none of them are of any considerable size. The aspect of this part of the country is, however, very rich, and not destitute of beauty ; and some new erections have recently been made upon it. The surface is a succession of water, sludge, strong loam, and gravelly hard, distributed in a very irregular manner ; and there are few cultivated productions of the field, the forest, or the garden, for which one part or the other of it is not well adapted. The living at Alverstoke is a rectory ; and that in Gosport is a curacy, under the patronage of the Alverstoke rector. Gosport is a market town having weekly markets, and fairs on the 4th of May and the 10th of October. The town consists of one pretty street extending from the harbour west ward to the gate through the line of fortification ; and besides this there are a number of cross streets. Some ofthe streets are well built ; but they do not make a very handsome appearance. The aspect of the town is however not unplea sant when approached by the water. The Established Church stands near the south east of the town ; and besides it, there is a Dissenting Chapel, and an Academy for the"], [260, "200 SOUTHERN SLOPE. education of dissenting preachers ; anel there is also a Catholic- Chapel. The privilege of holding a market was first granted to Gosport by the bishop of Winchester, who was proprietor of the old market-house tolls. The market-house stood ori ginally in the High-street, it consisted of a wooden-shed for the market people, with some apartments over for the officers of his lordship's baronial court; but about the year 1811, a more commodious market place was erected on the shore. Gosport is badly situated for trade with every part of the county ; and it may be said to depend wholly upon the government establishments. The consequence is that, in times of war and activity anel movement in the army and navy, Gosport is all bustle and buisness. But the bustle and business, which depend upon war and warlike establish ments anel preparations, are not of the most wholesome, or desirable kind ; and accorelingly, when in the the soft atmos phere of a protracted peace, the sword is rusting and the war ship is rotting, such a place as Gosport becomes a town of desolation. There is one project however, which has received the sanction of the legislature, that may give a considerable im pulse to Gosport, and that is a branch railway from the London and Southampton line. This branch parts from the main line at Bishopstoke, and will make Gosport not only a thoroughfare, but the port of at least a portion of the district through which the line passes ; and, in order to render this as complete as possible, a steam-boat on chains is established on the Gosport ferry, similar to that on the Itchen ferry at Southampton. Thus Gosport will become an important point in the line of communication with all places which the Southampton railway opens up ; and it is very likely that the communication will be extended further to the east ward, so as to form a grand line of communication with all the south coast ; but in this line Gosport will always main tain its importance, as there can be no rail road across Ports mouth harbour, We omitted to mention, that the supposed etymology of"], [261, "JlOYAI KIAVA1 W.-\u00ae S PQTAtL.

This name is said to have been bestowed upon it by Henry De Blois, bishop of Winchester in consequence of the fishermen here having been the means, of saving the life of his brother, King Stephen, when the vessel in which that monarch was returning from Normanely was wrecked on this part of the shore during a violent storm. Many stories of a similar kind are told of the names of other places ; and probably there is an equal absence of truth in them all ; for though a grant to the inhabitants of the village to call it God's Port is said to exist in the archives of Win chester cathedral, we must not believe implicitly that this was the origin of the name, though a coincidence between that and the old appellation of Gorse Port, may give a colour to the matter ; but the real meaning is probably the creek among the gorse or furze, with which plant all the dry ground here appears to have been overrun in early times. A parallel case will illustrate this, and show what little depen dency ought to be placed on these monkish derivations: Dun dee, the name of an ancient town. in Scotland, is evidently Tun Tai \u2014 \" The hill-fort on the Tay,\" as literally as the an cient language of that part of Scotland can be expressed in modern Scotch ; and yet the current legend is, that the earl of Huntingdon \u2014 or somebody else, having been saved from shipwreck there, gratefully built a chapel there in honor of the Blessed Virgin, and called the place Donum Dei\u2014\" the gift of God,\" which words the corporation of the town have ever since borne as the motto of their crest, which crest is a lily emblematical of the spotless innocence of the vir gin ; though, as supporters to their shield, they have added two terrible serpents, with wings and claws and arrowy tails, to show that they were prepared for the result either way. We mention this as a matter of more consequence than some will be apt to suppose ; for if the etymologies are viti ated the whole of the history is vitiated ; and as the Port, that is the entire harbour of Portsmouth, considered as a place of resort for craft, is the radical portion of all the names vol. il dd"], [264, "202 SOUTHERN SLOPE. of adjoining places whereof it forms part, and the rest of the name only adjunctive, it is clearly made out that, from the time of the earliest nomenclature, the harbour, the roadstead, and all the marine accommodations here, which are of so im portant a character still, and have been equally so in earlier times, have been the grand attraction ; and that everything else has been named from its own properties, but with re ference to the Port. PORTSEA AND PORTSMOUTH. These names afford a direct confirmation of what we have just said. Portsea is Portes Ea, Oe, Y, or I, according to the pronunciation \u2014 that is the \" Island of the Port\" and Portsmouth is as obviously Portes mouth \u2014 \u2022\" the mouth of the Port \" which is indeed the old spelling. Further we may remark that in all compound names of places, of which \" Sea \" forms the last syllable, Ea, Island, forms the substantive part of that syllable, while \" S \" is the sign of the genitive or pos sessive case, of the preceding part of the name, the \"e '' which preceded \" s \" in the genitive being left out in the modern spelling. We have a further illustration of this in the name of the village of Hilsea, in the northern part of Portsea island. This, though not on a hill, certainly is on ground more elevated than the adjoining marshes ; and therefore it is the \" height of the island,\" without any refe rence to the Port, with which it has no immediate connection. Portsea Island has long been an interesting spot, though chiefly in a maritime point of view \u2014 for the rendez vous of fleets, and the assembling, embarking, and landing of armies engaged in foreign wars. It does not appear to have been very remarkable for trade at any one period of its history, for it must have been ranked lower than Southamp ton in a mercantile point of view, otherwise Southampton would have not been raised to the dignity, of the Port, and Portsmouth which was, and which is, the Port, in a mili tary point of view, appended to the other as a mere creek. Natural circumstances were, and are, highly favorable for this. In ancient times, the island appears to have been"], [265, "203 portsea island. nearly impregnable, unless at a few points, in consequence of the water, by which it was surrounded, and the mud and marsh along its shores, which rendered it impossible for craft of any burthen to land, except perhaps on a few points where there are hards or firm beaches. This appears to have been the case in the time of the Romans, as there are no remains of their works upon the island. The elevated portion was how ever, well adapted for the muster of armies ; and it is proba ble that this was the circumstance which occasioned the ori gin of the town. In the Saxon times it was royal property ; but it was transferred to the Minster at Winchester by El freda the heroic Queen of Ethelred, and the aunt and mili tary instructress of Alfred. At the suppression of the New Minister, it became the property of Winchester college, by which the greater part of the land, together with the advow sons of the parish churches, is still held. The extreme length of the island from Port bridge on the north, the only approach by land, to Southsea castle on the south, is about four miles ; and the extreme breadth, from Cumberland fort on the east, to the King's stairs at the wes tern extremity of the dock, is about three miles and three quarters. The average breadth, however, does not exceed two miles. As is the case with the district to the westward of the harbour, the seaward shores of this island are nearly straight lines, and they form an obtuse salient angle, \u2014 the south-western shore, from Southsea castle to the great tower at the entrance of the harbour, is about a mile and a quarter ; and the south-eastern one, from Southsea castle to Cumber land fort is nearly two miles and three-quarters. The tide into both harbours sets pretty strongly against these shores, and hence the beaches are scoured, and in some places a con siderable part of the land has been worn away, the light matters being carried up and deposited in the upper shallows of the harbours, while the pebbles have been left upon the beaches. At present the sea does not appear to be making any considerable inroad ; for the beaches have been worn to a resisting slope, and the action of the water has been elimi- DD 2"], [266, "204 SOUTHERN SLOPE. nished by the silting up of the upper parts of the harbours, especially Langston harbour, the shore toward which is softer than that towards Portsmouth. From this character of the shores, more especially of that from Southsea to Ports mouth, the water is clear, and well adapted for sea bathing. The eastern side of the island is more marshy and it is broken by arms of the sea which however are only very narrow runs at low water. Of these creeks or lakes there are three : Eastney lake, immediately north of the peninsula upon which Cumberland fort is built, and which peninsula terminates in a long point, running into Langston harbour ; north of this, Velder lake about three-quarters of a mile northward of the former, and separated from it by a rounded peninsula ; and the lake of the great Saltern, which how ever is merely a creek in the marshes, but which extends farther into the land than either of the others. It extends in the direction of Hilsea, and receives a small brook at the head of the tideway. The Salterns here were, at one time, of considerable value. The northern boundary of the island is upon the average about a mile and a half in length, forming an irregular curve. It is fortified by a zigzag rampart, and the space between it and Port bridge creek, which joins the two harbours, can be laid under water in case of a siege. On the mainlanel end of the bridge there is a tete du pont, for defending the entrance if necessary. The land towards the east and north-east is very flat and marshy ; but great part of it has been drained, and it is very rich ; though there are but few inhabitants on this side of the island. The west side is even more irregular in its outline than the east ; but it is not nearly so marshy, the elevation being a little greater. Here it forms a sort of three peninsulas ; one extending over nearly the southern half of the line, anel containing upon its western margin, Portsmouth and Port sea, with the government docks abutting on the west of the latter. The second peninsula is about a mile and a half north of the docks, it projects a considerable distance into the water, and has powder magazines on the points or hards."], [267, "205 PORTSEA ISLAND. The remaining peninsula consists chiefly of field and marsh, and presents nothing interesting. These flexures of the line of shore, have little beauty when seen from the land side, but they give no inconsiderable interest in sailing up or down the harbour. Parochial and other divisions. With the excep tion of the northern part, which is in the parish of Wymer ing, and the extra-parochial land at the great Saltern, which last is chiefly in the hands of government, the island of Portsea contains two parishes, \u2014 the parish of Portsmouth, and the the parish of Portsea. The first of these is of very small extent, consisting only of the town and its fortifica tions to the counterscarp of the principal ditch ; for the ravelins and other outworks are in the parish at Portsea. Besides the space included by the works, however, the two gun wharfs, \u2014 the one of which abuts on the north-west of Portsmouth, and the other on the south-west of Portsea, \u2014 are included within the parish, though they are not within the fortifications, but separated from them by a wall and ditch. The parish of Portsea is very extensive, and con tains far more inhabitants than the town of Portsmouth, though the greater number of them also live without the fortifications by which the town of Portsea, properly so called, is defended on the land side. Some idea of the relative importance of these two parishes may be formed from the statement, that Portsmouth, in 1831, contained 8,083 inhabitants, and Portsea 42,306, \u2014 in all a population exceeding 50,000. In order to communicate as clear a notion as possible of the relations of these parishes, and also of the parliamen tary borough of Portsmouth, we shall suppose that the reader enters the island by Port bridge, proceeds by the main road, and arrives at the shipping place for the Isle of Wight, \u2014 noticing the particulars right and left as he goes along. Suppose, then, that our imaginary tourist has ar rived at the bridge : \u2014 about three furlongs, along a road curving a little to the westward, bring him to the northern"], [268, "206 THE SOUTHERN slope. extremity of the scattered village of Hilsea, with its barracks or their remains. At this point the road branches, \u2014 the left-hand road passing by the east of Hilsea, southward by the villages of Copner and Milton, to the south coast of the island ; and the right-hand branch being the main road to Portsmouth. About three furlongs farther, the road enters the parish of Portsea, and here Gatcomb lies about a quar ter of a mile to the left, and the harbour on the right, is nearly at the same distance ; rather more than another furlong brings one to the Green post, which is the northern boundary of the parliamentary borough ; and another half mile reaches North End, where the buildings begin to thicken. Stubbington lodge lies a quarter of a mile to the left here ; and the shore of the harbour is about three fur longs to the right. Two furlongs bring one to Kingston, where the road again divides \u2014 the left-hand branch passing down the centre of the island, by the villages of Buckland and Fratton, which is pretty thickly studded with build ings for more than a mile ; and the old parish church of Portsea stands on the left of it about three-quarters-of-a-mile from Fratton. At about half-a-mile, Lake lane diverges toward the right of this road, and joins the main road at the end of another mile ; also, just above the church, Dead man's lane turns to the left, along the north wall of the great cemetery in which the church is built. Returning to the fork at Kingston, the right-hand branch proceeds a quarter of a mile to the right, along the crescent \u2014 the con cavity of which is to the south. It is here within about three hundred yards of the harbour on the right where Rud more mill is situated, Passing the poor-house on the left, a cemetery on the right, and at last arriving at Commercial road \u2014 which is the first regularly built street, one comes to the junction of Lake lake, from the left, which is three quarters of a mile from the western extremity of the cres cent. This junction may be considered as the central point of the largest assemblage of streets in the island ; but their number and direction are too various for our notice ; at a"], [269, "207 PORTSEA ISLAND. quarter of a mile more, one arrives at the fodt of the glacis of the Portsea fortifications ; and here the Lion gate road passes across the glacis, and through the ravelin, across the ditch, and through the curtain, between two bastions, and continues, as Queen-street, the principal street in Portsea within the walls. Its length from the gate to the gate of the docks on the harbour, is somewhere about half-a-mile ; but this is more than the absolute extent of the town from east to west. This is the main road to the docks and arse nal : but if Portsmouth be the object, one must proceed straight onward from the point where this road diverges, and something less than three-quarters of a mile brings one to the Land gate of Portsmouth. About half-a-mile from the gate, the road passes the edge of the dam which works the government tide-mill at the gun wharfs ; and, south ward, on the left, there is situated the village of Southsea, which is a considerable assemblage of streets, some of them spacious and handsomely built. The collection of buildings farther to the north, which we mentioned as forming the largest group in the island, is called Landport, from the land port of Portsmouth, and not from the entrance to the works at Portsea ; which is called Lion gate. Of the tho roughfare from Land gate, through Portsmouth, we shall speak afterwards ; but what we have already said may direct any one to the entrance of both the fortified places. To ward the left of the road which enters Portsmouth, there are very many villas and villages, all of them pleasantly situated, but by far too minute in their details for our notice. We shall now glance at the boundaries of the borough. We have already mentioned it as far as Green post, thence it proceeds southward to Stubbington lodge, and so on by zigzag all the way to Deadman's lane, which it reaches more than a quarter-of-a-mile east of the old church. It proceeds westward along the lane so as to exclude the church ; then northward along the road to Lake lane, down which it runs for a quarter of a mile, and then turning off to the left, proceeds by zigzags to the King's rooms' baths on"], [270, "208 THE SOUTHERN SLOPE. the beach, about half-a-mile south-east of the great round tower at the entrance of the harbour. From the south eastern parts of the ramparts there extends, for rather more than a mile in length, and a quarter-of-a-mile in average breaelth, a portion of Southsea common, once an extensive waste ; and this is used as a review and encampment ground. From Flat house, at the north-west point, there is along the glacis of the works and this remainder of the common, an uninterrupied stretch of open surface, for a length of nearly three miles ; and as this forms an unbroken communication between the inward harbour and the out ward sea, it of course contributes greatly to the salubrity of Portsmouth, Portsea, and the extensive towns and villages to the eastward. Fortifications. A very brief notice of these is all that we can afford ; and the only general remark which we shall make is, that, with a fleet at Spithead to keep com mand of the sea, the grand naval establishment here may be regarded as absolutely impregnable. To fortify the whole island, would be as useless as expensive ; because no army could invest the place, and no garrison could defend it. On the east and west, defences would be superfluous ; and those on the north, if they ever should become useful \u2014 which is neither to be expected nor wished, are calculated for pre venting a surprise, and not for protracted defence. The forts on the south, are for nearly the same purpose. Of them, Cumberland fort is a regular pentagon, of about a quarter-of-a-mile diameter, estimating to the top of the gla cis, at the salient angles of the bastions. Eastney fort, Lump's fort, and Southsea castle, as well as fort Monckton on the other side of the entrance, are small and irregular. The main fortifications, as we may term them, are seg ments of irregular polygons, of many sides, and therefore very strong. That of Portsmouth has six curtains with five bastions, one small bastion at the entrance of the har bour, and another toward Portsea, near the King's mill ; and there are ravelins in advance of all the curtains, some of"], [271, ""], [272, "FROM GOSPORT"], [273, "209 PORTSEA ISLAND. them with retired flanks. All the ditches are filled with water, and form part of the dam for working the mill, only they can be kept full by sluices in case of need. The ram parts are planted with trees, and form a very airy anel agree able promenade. The length of the chord, from the plat form battery to that of the mill, is about half-a-mile. The fortification of Portsea is a segment of a much larger poly gon ; and therefore it is still stronger in its form. It consists of three bastions, and two demi-bastions with out works ; and, as is the case with Portsmouth, the ditches admit of being kept full of water should that be necessary. There is another circumstance which adds greatly to the strength of these two lines of fortifications : they can act like two bastions of the same fort, and thus mutually defend each other. It is true that, if exposed to the terrible cross fire of these forts, the towns and villages beyond the glacis would not be in the most agreeable situation imaginable ; but then, if there were even a chance of an attack on Ports mouth from the land side, the island beyond the works would be of small use to any party friendly to those by whom the works were defended. The fort upon Block house point, the south-western part of the works of Ports mouth, and the great martello tower at the entrance of the harbour, are the immediate elefences of that entrance ; and there, a proper fleet at Spithead, would form an outwork not easily carried by any invader. \u2014 Such is a mere notice of those strong fortifications, which have been of no abso lute use since they were so strong, \u2014 and it is not desirable that they should ; but still they are there in case of acci dents ; and it may be well that it should be known that the arsenal of England is as impregnable as her fleets are in vincible.

Beyond this, the point extends more than a furlong further ; and it is be tween this point and Block-house point that the entrance to the harbour lies. The point from the king's stairs to its northern extremity is narrow, and near the middle of its length it has a projection eastward. South and north of this projection is the commercial harbour, with the Custom house on the eastern part of it. This harbour, which is lo cally called the Camber, is divided into two, with a very nar row channel between by the point alluded to. From south to north, it is about a quarter-of-a-mile in length, and the entrance to it, which is from the north-west, is not a hundred yards wide. Broad-street, which is a continuation of High street, extends down the middle of the point, and there are also various other streets and lanes, \u2014 this and the eastern side of the Camber being the only places where Portsmouth is directly bounded by the sea. Hence northward, the new and old gun-wharves, extending to the harbour, and their bases occupy rather more than a quarter-of-a-mile of the harbour on a straight line, \u2014 -the projection of the one being about a fur long, and that of the other rather more. Immediately beyond the gun- wharves there is an opening to the sea, with the build ings of Portsea on the other side. This is called the Com mons hard ; and both it and the row opposite are much devoted to the sale of frippery, so that this is neither the most cleanly nor the most moral spot in England. It is the great landing-place from the ships in the harbour \u2014 at least for the common sailors and those who keep up intercourse with them ; and it is also a place where boats may be taken to the other side, \u2014 north point in Gosport being rather less than half-a-mile distant. The Hard extends, as a sort of slip, a considerable way into the harbour ; and this forms the usual jetty for embarking or landing. This Common hard displays no very pleasant scene in times of peace, and"], [275, ""], [276, "v I E W F K \u00a9 1 Ifmcitster Mi,.,/,.,/ Ar l7tt /\"h,,,,-,,/,,,. ./\u201e' ft,,/,/., ,..< ,;,//,,,, Si,,,,"], [277, "211 PORTSEA ISLAND. in war time it must be far worse ; but as such scenes are inseparable from places where sailors resort in great numbers, it is probably better to have it thus concentrated than if it were dispersed all over the town. Immediately north of the Hard, are the gates of entrance to the grand naval arsenal ; and that, taken along the whole line of its quays and openings, extends to not less than a mile ; and, at its southern termination, it projects about a furlong beyond the beach at the Hard, which ensures a sufficient depth of water at the entrances of the docks and basins. As this is, in no sense of the word, a mercantile es tablishment, but merely for the building, the equipment, and the repair of ships of war, there are no basins, enclosed by tidal gates, in which vessels which need no repair can lie at the quays without any rising or falling with the tide. As long as a ship of war is sea-worthy, she has no business to touch the land, whether that land is a natural beach, or an artificial pier. In the language which the poet has alle gorically applied to Britain, the war-ship is literally de scribed, \u2014 \" Her march is on the mountain wave, Her home is on the deep.\" A ship of war has no consanguinity with the land ; and when she touches the shore, she is in the same predicament as the giant of old was, when the demi-god lifted him from the earth \u2014 her stay is gone and she is powerless. Even when such vessels are reposing, they ride in the waters, and are never put into any kind of dock unless they are unfit for the sea. Nor is it a little curious or incompre hensible, upon any known physical principle, that a ship should rot sooner in a wet dock, than when moored in a harbour or roadstead. Such, however, is the fact ; and until a better explanation is discovered, we may perhaps explain it by saying, that the water in a dock may become contaminated and putrid, but the water of the sea or a tidal harbour, never.

In a former part of this chapter we brought the traveller along the London road to the Land gate ; but a turn of about a hundred yards to the left has to be taken before one reaches the High-street When that is arrived at, the length of it is three furlongs ; and Broad-street, which turns to the north-west like a hook, is about two furlongs more. The High-street, as might be anticipated, is the best street in the town, and is, as one would say, spacious and well built ; but there is an air about it which says it is not exactly in its element in pacific times. Parallel to the High-street, and to the north of it, there are St. Thomas and Warblington streets, \u2014 the last of which terminates nearly, but not quite, at the Land gate. South of the High-street and parallel to it, there are two streets, Penny-street, and beyond that St. Nicholas-street, with a loop at their eastern termination. All these streets are crossed by St. Mary's-street and Oyster-street, the latter, extending from Quay gate \u2014 for even the Quay is shut out from the people, for the greater part of its length \u2014 to the grand pa rade ground in the south-western angle of the town, with the governor's gardens quite to the ramparts, and having the garrison chapel, or remains of the hospital of Domus Dei at the south-eastern extremity of the parade. Besides those now enumerated there are several other streets ; and, with the exception of barrack squares and the space round the church, the town is closely built. The principal barracks are Colewort barracks, near the Land gate ; Cambridge bar racks to the left of the High-street in going down, and the Marine barracks, on the south side of St. Nicholas street. These barracks can, upon an emergency, afford accomoda tion for a very considerable number of troops. The church of Portsmouth stands between the High street and St. Thomas-street, below Oyster street, It was built by the directions of Bishop Rupibus, and dedicated to Thomas a Becket.

The altar-piece consists of the monument of George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, who, having been sent by Charles II to col lect an army for the purpose of going to seek the laurels he hael lost in a former expeelition to Rochelle, was murdered at the Spotteel Dog in the High-street, by Felton, and whose heart is understooel to have been placed in an urn which surmounts the monument. Nothing could justify the assassination certainly ; but it is a little singular that the monument of a courtier \u2014 and perhaps the courtier who was one of the means of bringing Charles to the block, should remain as the altar-piece of a Christian church. In the cupola of this church, there are eight bells, upon some of which there are rather ludicrous inscriptions. The above-noticed, and the garrison chapel, are the only churches of the establishment within the walls ; but there are several dissenting chapels, \u2014 though there are more without the walls, and there are also, in addition to the old church of Portsea, several others of recent erection. Portsmouth contains a liberal supply of the usual esta blishments for the purposes of charity, instruction, and amusement, and some of the inns and hotels are on a scale of considerable magnitude ; but none of them has any very strong claims to attention, especially in a town where there are so many matters worthier of notice, and wdien the space which we can devote to the whole is so limited. Portsea, within the walls, stands upon rather more grounel than Portsmouth, but it is nearly of the same form, It is of comparatively modern date, \u2014 there being, at the close of the seventeenth century, only one house upon the ground which it now occupies. Though the docks abut upon it for their whole length, and it owes its existence solely to the naval establishment, there is no elirect communication be tween them \u2014 the landward side of the docks being sepa rated by a wall. Queen-street, already mentioned as being a continuation of the London road from Lion gate to the Common hard and the dock gates, is the principal street,"], [282, "214 SOUTHERN SLOPE. and nearly bisects the town. A little way down Queen street, North-street branches off to the right ; and near the other end of it there is Unicorn gate, through the fortifica tions. A little above North-street, St. James'-street branches off to the left, and proceeds by St. George's-square, and the king's mill, to the custom-house and quay in Portsmouth; and this is perhaps the shortest line from the main London road to the shipping place. There are many other streets within the walls, but none of them are thoroughfares ; and they are in general meanly built, and contain nothing of general interest. St. George's-square, \u2014 which, by the way, is more like a weaver's shuttle in shape, is a pleasant open place, with a church dedicated to St. George in the centre ; and on the north-east of it are situated the offices of En gineers. \u2014 A town of such recent origin can, of course, have no history. The Government establishment consists of so many parts, these are on a scale of such magnitude, and they are withal so important in a national, and even in a more gene ral point of view, that many volumes would be requisite, in order to do them justice. From the time that Alfred de feated the Danes, after he had established the navy, of which Portsmouth harbour appears to have been the first rendez vous, the establishment here has been in a state of progres sive increase, though of course with fluctuations, answering to those of the times, and the tempers of the successive mo narchs. The grand improvements, however, began in the reign of Queen Anne, and continued up to the close of the late war, by which time everything was so extensive and so complete, that repairs and minor improvements are all that have since been necessary. The Dock and Arsenal, on the east side of the harbour, and abutting on the town of Portsea, claim the first atten tion ; for there are the principal manufactures and stores of the grand substantial parts of ships of war. The mast-houses and mast-ponds, the grand rope-walk \u2014 nearly eleven hundred yards in length, the store-houses, the various workshops, the"], [283, "PORTSMOUTH.

The great docks are four in number, \u2014 three in the direction of east and west, and one deflected south-east. All these open into a great receiving basin ; they are twenty-two feet deep ; and there are very powerful engines for pumping out water and keeping them dry. The dimensions are such as to aelmit of the building or repair of vessels of the greatest burden ; and they are most conveniently situated with respect to all the preparing houses for the different materials requisite for constructing the hull of a vessel. So admirably indeed is the whole arranged, that there is not more waste of time in the building of a ship equal to a hundred sizeable merchantmen, than there is in building a cock-boat on an ordinary slip. The masting and rigging are performed opposite to where the mast-ponds and rope-walks are ; the guns and shot are taken in at the gun wharves, where the quantity of both is immense ; and the victualling department is dispersed over various parts of Portsmouth and Gosport; but they are ad mirably situated for facilitating the preparation of a ship for sea. Upon the whole, the manufactory of ships of war, is certainly the largest, probably the most important, and un questionably the most complete and admirably managed, in the British dominions. The most interesting operations, at least in the eyes of an ordinary visitor, which are carried on within the dock area, are the block-making machinery, and the preparation of the copper for sheathing. The whole processes of the former ope ration may be seen in the course of one visit ; and a stranger may see a block formed out of the timber, and finished in less time than we would require to describe, or name the different parts of the operation. The rolling of the copper is less ingenious, because the operations are very simple ; but still it is well worthy of a visit. The anchor-forge, when in operation, is a splendid establishment ; and when we con-"], [288, "216 SOUTHERN SLOPE. sider the magnitude of the articles made, and the great ham mering that they require, in order to give them the requisite toughness and elasticity, we cannot help regarding the ma nufacture of them as one of the most extraordinary sights in this very extraordinary place. It is in vain however, to attempt anything like a selection, and it would be equally in vain to attempt a verbal descrip tion of this the most magnificent of all our national esta blishments. To be appreciated, and even to be understood, the naval works and workings at Portsmouth must be visit ed; and it reflects no small credit on the government and on those who have the local management, that the whole of these splendid operations and collections can be seen readily and without a fee \u2014 which fee is felt by foreigners as a mean stigma at many other places in England.

CHAPTER IX. THE NEW FOREST. The district of the New Forest, is one of the most peculiar, if not the most interesting, in England. It forms, as it were, a country apart, having its own distinctive character. Its situation is not insular in a physical point of view, for only the south side and about one-third of the north-east are bounded by the sea; but, in so far as regards Hampshire, it is nearly insulated : the distance from the tide-way in the Test at Redbridge being only five miles eastward of Cad nam bridge on the borders of Wilts, and the remaining land boundaries being Wilts on the north, and Dorset on the west. In so far, indeed, it is detached from these coun ties, though not insulated; for, generally speaking, the lines of boundary lie over downs and heaths, some of which are of the most bleak and sterile character, though even they are spotted here anel there with rich patches and bot toms. The greatest peculiarity of the district is the contrast of the central parts with the outskirts, especially those along the sea, \u2014 that is, along the Southampton Water on the north-east, and the Solent along the south-east as far as Hurst castle, and then the Channel along the south as far as the boundary of Dorset, which is at Durley chine, situated VOL. II. FF"], [292, "218 THE NEW FOREST. about two miles north-east of the entrance to Pool harbour. Diversity rather than richness is, however, the character of even those boundaries ; for while they in some places con sist of very sweet alternations of glade and woodland, in others they are as sterile as can be imagined. With but few exceptions, and they will be noticed afterwards, the boundaries ofthe New Forest are private property, differently cultivated, according to the nature of the soil and the taste of the owners ; and there are various manors, lands attached to lodges, and other spots held as property, here and there over the surface. But, with these exceptions, the New Fo rest district, that is, the Forest itself, with the surrounding manors and purlieus, bears some resemblance to one of those larger islands in the Pacific, which have their margins settled by people in so far civilised, and carrying on trade, while the interior is in a state of nature. This has, in all probability, been the condition of the district from very early times, not only from the time of the Conquest, but anterior even to the arrival of the Ro mans. It is true, that William stands accused of having depopulated this district for the purpose of turning it into a forest ; and the monkish chroniclers rate him, in no very measured terms, for the desolation and the sacrilege perpe trated by him in this devoted district. \" In the wood which is called the New Forest,\" says Henry of Huntingdon, \" churches and villas were eradicated, the people extirpated, and it was made a habitation of wild beasts.\" Again, says Brompton, \" the New Royal Forest, called in English Ytene, in which William the Bastard drove out the people, demo lished the villages, and despoiled the churches, for more than thirty miles in length, and converted it into a dwelling of wild beasts.\" The Historian of Winton is yet more lachry mose, as well as more circumstantial respecting, the state of the district, anterior to its being razed and afforested by the victorious but merciless William. \" For thirty miles and more,\" says he, \" where aforetime there were human dwell ings, and land abounding in corn and in fruits,\" \u2014 for so the"], [293, "219 THE NEW FOREST. words terra fructif era, necnon frugif era, may be rendered \u2014 \" he extirpated the dwellings, rooted up the orcharels and gardens, with even the churches and the burying grounds ; and the whole was turned into a desert and place of sport for wild beasts, by the order of the king.\" Knighton yet farther amplifies the matter, though, as he alludes not to the Conqueror but to his son Rufus, who ultimately paid the penalty of his hunting in this forest, he thereby throws a little confusion upon the story. \" This William (Rufus)\" says he, \" made forests in many places through the centre of the kingdom ; and, between Southampton and the priory of Twynam, which is now called Christchurch, he leveled twenty-two mother churches, with villages, chapels, manors, and mansions \u2014 fifty-two parishes according to some; and he made the New Forest, which he called his New Garden, and he replenished the same with stags, and deer, and other wild beasts \u2014 giving them a holiday for the first seven years.\" This, it must be admitted, was sad work \u2014 that is, if it happened to be true ; but the very circumstance of the de vastation increasing in atrocity, in proportion to the time elapsed before the account was written, throws a doubt upon it; and we shall find that this doubt is strengthened to a perfect contradiction, as well by history, as by the stronger testimony of nature. Among the early historians, we need only mention that the author of the Saxon Chroni cle, which was written in or immediately after the reign of William the Conqueror, says nothing about the spoliation of this part of Hants ; though he does mention the several atro cities of William, not forgetting to close the list with an account of the dreadful famine and pestilence, which, accord ing to most of the monkish writers, though not expressly or strongly according to the chronicler, was a demonstration of Divine justice, in vengeance for the atrocities of this cruel king. Now, this last matter, although not confined exclu sively to monachists and other miracle-mongers, places the justice of the Being, from whom the vengeance is said to FF 2"], [294, "220 THE NEW FOREST. have come, in a very singular light. William the Conqueror oppressed the people, razed their habitations, cast down their churches, overturned their altars, and perpetrated the greatest violence to man, and the greatest impiety in the sight of Heaven ; and for as much as he, William the Con queror, was thus outrageously guilty, the Almighty vindi cated the integrity of Eternal justice by sending famine and pestilence \u2014 upon the people of England, who had suffered all the injury, while the Conqueror himself never had a head-ache nor was stinted of a dinner ! This, we are sorry to say it, is but too common with those who are piously fletant about the tyranny of rulers and the suffering of na tions ; and yet it is impossible to imagine a more direct charge of cruelty and injustice against the Divine Being ; for, if man perpetrates iniquity upon man, what sort of jus tice would it be in the God of mercy to smite the sufferers % In truth, the very naming of such calamities of nations as being punishments of Heaven, specially inflicted, in ven geance for the crimes either of rulers or of nations, in itself clearly shows, that the minels of the parties so imagining are quite unfit for bringing to issue any historical or other question in which the least doubt is involved. It may be all very true, that, from the unjust manner in which Wil liam dispossessed the Saxon lords, and bestowed their lands upon his favourites and followers ; from the violent means which he took to enforce the feudal law upon the native population ; anel, above all, from the violent resistance which was made to his measures, the disturbed state of the coun try may have occasioned the famine ; and that, again, the pestilence, though certainly not in consequence of any spe cial judgment of Heaven. In modern times, we are fortu nately exempted from those great national commotions, and also, in a great measure, from those contingencies of nature which are the natural causes of famine ; but enough re mains to show us what would be the natural succession of things, in' a state of society so rude and unsettled as that of England was at the time of the Conquest. Mild in com-"], [295, "221 THE NEW FOREST. parison as our years of dearth have of late been; and distant as they have been from famine, even to any one class of the people ; yet there is always an indication of disease that follows after the indication of famine, as a very obvious natural consequence ; anel this shows that if the antecedent were brought up to the same degree of horror as in ancient times, the same would be the case with the consequent. There is no doubt that famine could be brought about by an adequate degree of oppression and the suspension of in dustry, in any age or country ; and there is just as little doubt that were this to be the case, disease, equivalent in effect to pestilence whatever might be its type, would be the consequence. We mention this as one ground of cau tion necessary to be observed by every one who wishes to judge candidly and correctly of the accounts of William and his immediate successor, and of the vengeance inflicted by Heaven upon the country and upon them, \u2014 subjects which are almost certain to be suggested by even a simple allu sion to the New Forest ; and which subjects have been the themes of so much declamation, both in prose and in verse, that the popular echo of them \u2014 which is always floating about, is somewhat hostile to a fair and philosophical judg ment. And, though this is only a forest, misapprehension on the subject of it, is very apt to taint the foundation of one's estimate of the whole history of the country. We shall therefore offer a few further remarks in this place, so that we may enter upon our survey of the Forest, as free as possible from all prejudice and means of error. The epithet \" New,\" which appears to have been given to this forest originally by William, shows that there were other forests which had existed before this one obtained the name and had forest law applied to it. It does not hence follow however, that either this forest, or any other forest in Eng land, was made by the dismissal of a large number of people, the demolition of their habitations, and the planting of the localities with trees. Forest planting, at least upon any considerable scale, is comparatively modern in England ;"], [296, "222 THE NEW FOREST. and we have great doubts whether a single forest tree was planted, or a single nursery of plants existed out of which such a tree could be obtained, until many years after the Conquest. There is natural evidence of this found in the timber of all the very old buildings, wherever such timber exists ; for this timber, if freely exposed to the air, and protected from the direct action of the sun and the atmos phere, is as perfect now as when it was placed in the build ing. No timber of trees which have once passed through the hands of the nurseryman, so as to be forced in their in fancy beyond their proper natural habit, has this dura bility ; and it appears that, if artificial growth has once weakened the character of a tree, no future progeny of the same tree can regain the exact quality of which the culti vation deprived it. But, in so far as the trees of the New Forest are ascertained to be self-planted, we believe they are found to possess all the durability of the ancient oaks ; and this circumstance is well nigh conclusive against the fact of any planting of this forest. It will however be said, that it does not necessarily follow from the turning of this district into a forest, that William the Conqueror, or whoever else did the deed, planted it with trees, for there are some forests which do not contain a sin gle tree. But the original term was applied to surfaces which were so much tangled by wood or brake, that the chase could not be followed upon them on horseback; and, in law, \" forests \" were royal, and the hunting-grounds of subjects were \" chaces.\" If a numerous population adequate to the maintenance of fifty or even twenty parish churches, had existed in this part of Hampshire previous to 1079, when it was understood to have been afforested by William, no tree, such as that from which the arrow of Tyrrel is said to have glanced, could have grown up in the twenty-one years which intervened between the afforestation and the death of Rufus. A planted forest requires a long time before it is thickly sheltered with timber; and therefore, the district in question must have been a thickly wooded one, probably much"], [297, "223 THE NEW FOREST. more so than it is now, even long before the Conquest ; and instead of the Conqueror demolishing so many churches, and depopulating so many parishes, as the monkish writers allege, it is very probable that he did not destroy a single human habitation, but merely extended forest law to that portion of the district which was without inhabitants, covered by furze and heath in great part of its surface, and having trees of more or less stunted character on some of the richer spots, just as is the case at the present day. The character of the soil, that is the sub-soil, which is in most places so near the surface that none but the hardiest plants of the wilderness will thrive or indeed exist except by artificial means, is conclusive evidence, either that Wil liam, or whoever else was the party accused, never expelled a population from this part of England, or that they did a great deal more \u2014 made the people take all the fertile land along with them ; for there are few poorer districts within the four seas than very many parts of this same New Forest ; and the number of naturally fertile acres in it would not waste much arithmetic in the counting. Besides, a country can never be in a very high state of cultivation for any length of time, without leaving some memorials, and of such memorials there are none to be found, except those which have occurred long since the Conquest, and which have had very limited causes, compared with that for which the Con queror is blamed, and on account of which the special ven geance of Heaven is said to have been inflicted upon his people and progeny. Such being the facts of the case \u2014 quite accordant with reason in so far as they are historical, and easily put to the proof in so far as they are natural \u2014 it becomes both a curious and important enquiry, why Williain was thus falsely re presented. This is curious, because the assertion gratifies no apparent feeling, saving that of the love of gloating over human misery ; and it is important, because if falsehood is once established on this point, the veracity of those who asserted or repeated the falsehood may be justly questioned"], [298, "224 THE NEW FOREST. on every other subject whereof they treat. For instance, the curfew and the observances connected with it, which have been so generally described and regarded as proceedings of the most wantonly tyrannical despotism, and for which no adequate rational cause on the part of the Conqueror can be, or at least has been, assigned, had probably an object altogether different. No doubt these were in part precau tionary measures to prevent the Saxons from entering into conspiracies against William and his followers ; but it is well known that the English were in those days very much ad dicted to nocturnal revels, in the course of which much mis chief was often done ; and it was by no means improbable that William's object, at least in part, was to introduce a more decorous observance of hours, which, though it no doubt tended to increase the revenue and strengthen the powrer of the king, was yet more beneficial to the people themselves. Several historians, and Voltaire among the rest, have de fended the conduct of a monarch who levied hearth taxes, and would consequently be careful not to diminish the number of hearths to such an extent as this would have diminished them, \u2014 and all for the mere making of a hunting ground, which would not have been available for the purpose during the whole term of his life. In as far as the policy of William, and his object of levying as much money from the people of England for the continental wars as he possibly could, are concerned, this argument seems to be conclusive ; but still, the strength of the case lies in the fact of the New Forest being, in great part at least, under forest vegetation before William extended forest law to it. At or near the place where Rufus fell, there were charcoal burners regularly established, which is not likely to have been the case, in a forest of only twenty years standing. Another point is, that William could not have planted a forest, and stocked it with red and fallow deer at the same time ; because these animals would as cer tainly have destroyed the young trees in this part of Hamp shire, as they would do in other places. The greatest herd"], [299, "225 THE NEW FOREST. of red deer now existing in the kingdom, is that belonging to the duke of Athol, on the mountains of Minigag, between Athol and Badenoch, anel throughout the wdiole of their range there is not a single young tree of any description, nor can a plantation be made unless it is completely fenced against them. Therefore, taking in the whole scope of the argument, we may safely conclude, that, other than convert ing a natural forest into a royal one, William occasioned little or no alteration in the condition of this district, even to the demolition of a single house, to say nothing about the churches, which have been represented as being so nu merous, and upon the demolition of which the gravemen of his offence is rested by the monks. The very learned, and often canelid, though somewhat pre judiced and polemical Dr. Milner is, in his History of Win chester, put to some shifts upon this point ; and reminds one somewhat of the personage described by Sir Walter Scott as devoting one eye to the Bible and the other to the bee-hives. Ihe doctor's clerical predilections, it would be unfair to call them -prejudices, go along with the monks, even to a miracle ; but his laical sense is constantly stirring up some little doubts as to whether this monarch had not other mo tives. He however falls into the common error of his autho rities in supposing that Doomsday Book got its name from its being the record of a more severe doom than even the last judgment: \" Vocatus est Domysday,\" says Rudborne,\" quia nulla parcit, secut nee magus dies judieii.\" Now, though to the pious Chronicler, the drawing up of this Sta tistical account of great part of the kingdom \u2014 and it was nothing more than this in reality, might appear more terrible than any other judgment, yet it was in itself more praise worthy than censurable, inasmuch as it shewed a desire on the part of the king, to know the resources of his country, and in whose custody they were ; a proceeding in which he merely imitated the example of the illustrious Alfred. In passing w'e may remark that the name of this record means nothing more than the judgment which was awarded upon VOL II. GG"], [300, "226 THE NEW FOREST. the value and holding of lands by a jury ; and, while allud ing to names, it may be mentioned that \" Ytene \" the old name of the whole of this district, may be rendered the insu lar or detached wood or wooded country ; which is a farther corroboration of the fact that William dispersed no inhabi tants, and levelled no houses or churches in this district ; neither did he, in all probability, send any stockof deer to it, as these animals were at one time pretty abundant in this part of the country. The question as to why the charge has been so boldly and so generally made, remains therefore to be noticed, before we get entirely riel of this preliminary subject ; and the solution is not difficult to find. There is no doubt that the clergy of the time had acquired a complete ascendancy over the minds of the Saxon kings, and the more wealthy and influential of the ealdermen and earls, by encouraging them to the com mission of offences at one time, and frightening them with the consequences at another, until they had got the greater part of the civil power, and no small portion of the temporal posessions and property. The Saxons appear, from this and from some other causes, to have been pretty deeply sunk in ignorance and its concomitant vices, at the time when the Normans came among them ; and though the latter certainly had no very just claims to goodness, yet they appear to have had far more energy of character than the Saxons ; but they preferred institutions of their own endowment; and for a time these were mostly filled by foreigners. The Normans were accordingly not of so giving a disposition as the Saxons had been, and more than this, William actually ejected several of the ecclesiastics from the more wealthy benefices, and bestowed these upon his relations and followers. These circumstances of course rendered William and his immediate successors not a little odious in the eyes of the monks ; and it is for this reason that these pious persons have mingled so much assafoetida in the wherewithal in which they have embalmed his memory. That William was anything but a tyrant, it would be not"], [301, "227 THE NEW FOREST. only unjust but useless to allege, for tyranny was then the order of the day with every one who had the power of ex ercising it ; and society had not advanced so far as to look upon the semblance of mildness and forbearance in opposi tion to very different feelings within, as the livery of good breeding and high rank. It is possible, that those in the same rank in society, and possessing the same power, as the Conqueror and his successors and their barons, \u2014 if such power be now possessed by any one, are not better than the Conqueror ; but the law, the custom, or the habit of society, renders it necessary for them to be a good deal more harm less ; or, if their propensities are strong the other way, they sometimes direct them against themselves and become the lamentation of that society of which they should be the ornaments. These matters are, however, foreign to our main subject, any further than that it is necessary to say something toward the removal or mitigation connected with the supposed desolation that preceded the afforestation of this district, before we can enter even into a brief survey of it, in such a way as to be secure against error. Having done this, we shall proceed to notice some of the more pro minent circumstances connected with it ; and, in order that we may be enabled to do this as briefly and as clearly as possible, we shall consider them under different heads. EXTENT, COASTS, AND BOUNDARIES. We are, then, to consider the New Forest district of Hampshire as a detached portion of the mainland of the county, different in its general character, formation, and ap pearance, from that which lies across the Southampton Wa ter to the north-east. In so far as it is forest, it has its own peculiar laws, though these are now very different from what the Forest Law was in the days of its rigour ; and in this respect, the forest may be looked upon as a sort of monument by means of which we can conjure up the ima gination of the past, anel contrast it with the reality of the present. In as far as those laws, or the remnant of them are GG 2"], [302, "228 THE NEW FOREST. concerned, the forest portion has its own capital, and its own court. Then, as the districts not included in the fo rest are, excepting a comparatively small portion of the north-east, divided from the rest of Hampshire by the whole breadth of the forest, and as they lie pretty wide of each other, and some of them are separated by barren tracks, they become, to a very considerable extent, detacheel districts, each having its own distinct society, and pursuing its own plans. The form of the entire district gives nearly that of a tri angle, though of one, the sides of which deviate much from the straight line. The extreme points are : on the east, Calshot castle, on the south side of the entrance to the Southampton Water ; on the south-west, as already noticed, Durley chine, one of those ravines or notches formed by land springs, or surface water, in the soft and crumbling cliffs, of various beds of tertiary formation, which are ex posed to the ravages of the sea along the entire portion of that coast at this district, which extends from Hurst castle to the western boundary of the county ; and the north-west point is at the Black hill, on Combe down, about five miles to the south-west of Salisbury. The straight lines joining these three points, fall more within than without the district, and do not entirely enclose it ; but still if we consider them as doing so, we shall have an approximation near enough for ail purposes of ordinary reference. The lines from Calshot castle, respectively, to the Black hill, on the north-west, and to Durly chine, on the south-west, are each about twenty-eight miles in length, and the western line joining their extremities is about twenty-two miles. These measures are a very little greater than the truth, though the difference is exceedingly trifling; and therefore, if we take the area of a triangle of which they form the three sides, we shall have the surface of the dis trict near enough for common purposes. Now the surface of this triangle is, in round numbers, about 282 square miles, or nearly 180,000 imperial acres ; and of this, about"], [303, "229 THE NEW FOREST. one-half, or more than 90,000 acres, are included within the perambulation of the Forest, and of these nearly 64,000 are forest-land, and the rest held with lodges, or are other wise not in the actual possession of the crown. It is worthy of remark, as an easy point of artificial memory, that the surface of forest-land in the district, is just about equal to a square of about ten miles in the side. Of the 64,000 acres of forest-land, only a moderate portion is covered with tim ber ; and not very much of that which is in the occupation of individuals, can be characterised as rich land. Of the particular surfaces we shall speak when we come to the topographical details ; but we may mention generally, that as the whole district is on the tertiary formation, consisting in many places of cold tough clays, or beds of very reten tive gravel, some of the bottoms contain a greater extent of bog and quagmire than occurs in all the rest of Hampshire. The land boundaries of the district, whether in the few miles across the marshy grounds from the head of the South ampton Water to Cadnam, or on the confines of Wilts and Dorset, have no particular interest about them ; generally speaking, they lie along grounds of comparatively little value, being across elevations of the sand, gravel, or clay ; but as there are no chalk heights, at least none where chalk appears uppermost, though it is probably, indeed we may say certainly, a substratum under the whole district, and consequently, there is none of the fine velvety turf which is found on the chalk downs, and forms such an appropriate pasturage for sheep. In tracing the boundaries, we shall begin at Cadnam bridge, which, as we have saiel, is about five miles to the westward of the Test at Redbridge. The road across the marshes of Reelbridge, by the village of Tot ton, over Netley marsh, and through a district diversified by wood, may be taken as the most marked line of distinc tion between the district of the lower valley of the Test, and that under consideration. Cadnam is on the edge of the forest, and it is a remarkable point from the number of roads that meet at the village. The road from Redbridge"], [304, "230 THE NEW FOREST. passes onward to Downton in Wilts, where it joins the main road that traverses the valley of the Avon. Another road, from London through Winchester and Romsey, crosses the one last-mentioned, and proceeds onward through Ring wood to Poole ; and a third proceeds directly south, through Lyndhurst and Brockenhurst to Lymington, \u2014 the last two being the principal roads which traverse the New Forest. In proceeding west anel north, and then southward along the line of the boundary, all the way from Cadnam bridge to the bay of Poole, the New Forest district is everywhere on the left-hand, and Wilts and Dorset in succession on the right. The first mile and half are nearly westward along the margin of a wooded part along the forest land. This ter minates at the village of Brook, near the source of the southern branch of the small river which joins the Test at Redbridge ; and at this point, a road, by Landford and White Parish to Salisbury, branches off to the right of the road to Downton. The boundary proceeds northward along the road for rather more than two miles, in which space there are a number of cottages, and the extremity is at the north east angle of Bramshaw wood, which juts into the extensive commons of Hamptworth and West Wellow, which with the continuation of Downton common form a natural boundary between Wilts and this district of Hants, to within about a mile and a half of the main stream of the Avon. The naked downs or commons are in Wilts, though a portion of Hants also is bleak, \u2014 there being a summit-level here, nearly in the direction of the boundary. From the angle of Bramshaw wood, the boundary takes a turn a little to the southward of the west, and meets the road to Downton at Bramshaw Telagraph, about two miles to the west of the angle alluded to. From the Telagraph, it follows nearly the direction of the road for about two miles and three-quarters along the summit ofthe down to Downton common, whence it stretches westward for about four miles to Gallows hill on Breamore down on the right bank of the Avon. In the course of this reach, the boundary crosses the Avon about a mile below"], [305, "231 THE NEW FOREST. Downton ; and the water-meadows upon that river here are about three-quarters of a mile in breadth. From the angle at Breamore down, the boundary passes south west- ward for three quarters of a mile along Grimsditch, an old line of fortification, which extends about a couple of miles in length from Castle ditches or Whitchbury, northward. This is an ancient hill-fort but it is not in Hants, though a loop of the boundary lies only half-a-mile east and west of it, and extends about a mile and three furlongs south, \u2014 the southern angle being in the copses of Brookheath. Two miles south, where it leaves Grimsditch, from Brookheath, the boundary extends north and west to Combe down, in a very bleak part of the country, about two miles and a half north-west of Castle ditches ; and it makes a detour south-west and then south-east upon the downs, until it again approaches within a mile and a quarter of the point at Brookheath ; and then it forms an irregular line of about a mile and three-quarters, to near Hockle hill on the Damerham brook which flows eastward to the Avon. This brook forms the boundary for about a mile ; and at more than another mile eastward the town of Fordingbridge is situated at the confluence of one or two small brooks with the Avon ; and the bridge over the river, from which the town takes the latter part of its name, is about a mile within the boundary of the county. No part of this very irregular corner of the district is inclu- ded in the forest lands ; and the extreme north-west lies high and is exceedingly sterile. From the point nearFordingbridge southward, the boundary may still be said to be in great part a natural one, lying along very dreary heaths and downs, or sometimes on the one edge of them and sometimes on the other, for three miles, south of Fordingbridge to Bleakhill the boundary lies parallel to the river, and is nowhere more than a mile and a half distant from it ; but at Bleakhill it turns westward, for a mile and a half; and then its course is southward, over dreary moors for the most part, till it reaches the sea in Poole bay. From the angle to the west ward of Bleakhill, it crosses the heaths and moors for about"], [306, "232 THE NEW FOREST. four miles, and then meets the Cranbourne river at Wool bridge, three miles to the west of Ringwood; and this small river forms the boundary for about two miles and a half. Beyond this the boundary extends for about two miles and a half over Parley common, and to the south of this common it crosses the river Stour, between the villages of West and East Parley, the first being in Dorset, and the second in Hants. From the valley of the Stour, southward, the boundary lies over the barren regions of Wallis and Poole heaths, and this terminates the circumambulation of the New Forest, in so far as the land boundary is con cerned It may be remarked that, except where the valleys of the rivers anel brooks which flow from Wilts and Dorset are concerned, the boundaries of this part of Hampshire are much better defined by nature than we generally meet with in the artificial divisions of counties. The forest lands touch on the boundary at comparatively few places, \u2014 not above five miles, in two places, first to the westward of Cad nam, and secondly from Bramshaw wood, westward, for about four miles ; and thus the whole of the valley of the Avon, with the moors and heaths on the right bank, as far as the boundary of the county, are without the forest juris diction. In tracing the sea-boundaries, or coasts, we shall begin at the same point, namely Redbridge ; and thence we shall proceed, with the sea on the left, and the land on the right, until we come to the opposite termination of the land boun dary. The average lengths of the several portions of the coast, omitting the minor irregularities, are nearly as follows : \u2014 From Redbridge, south-eastward to Calshot castle, about eleven miles. From Calshot castle to Hurst castle, west ward of south, about fourteen miles ; from Hurst castle, to Hengistbury head, almost directly west on the straight line, but with an inbend of nearly two miles in depth to the north forming Christchurch bay, about ten miles ; and from"], [307, "233 THE NEW FOREST Hengistbury head to Durley chine, about seven miles on the straight line, with an inbend of about a mile toward the north. The main lines of shore of the New Forest district, taken without reference to the estuaries, creeks, anel smaller in dentations, amount therefore, to a total length of forty-four miles, which does not differ more than a mile from the length of the land boundary, if similar allowances are made for the minor inequalities of both; and it is not a little remarkable, that if a diagonal is taken from the junctions of the sea and land boundaries at Redbridge and Durley chine, this diagonal divides the entire area into two parts almost exactly equal, and passes through the town of Lynd hurst, the metropolis of the forest, \u2014 that town being about six miles on the straight line from the Redbridge extremity of the diagonal, and about twenty-one from the Durley chine end. The coast presents no rock toward the sea, in any part of its extent ; and wherever there are bold cliffs, those cliffs are the result of simple marine and atmospheri cal action, and not formations that have been produced by any of the more uncommon and energetic operations of na ture. In so far as mere position is concerned, the district has eleven miles of north-easterly coast and thirty-one miles of south-easterly, the main point of division in respect of locality, being Calshot castle. But Hurst castle is the point of physical division, in as far as the sea and the action of the weather, and the resulting characters and changes of the lines of coast are concerned ; and, making this the point of division, there are twenty-five miles to the east and north of Hurst castle, and seventeen miles to the west. In a physical point of view, these two sections of the coast are the opposites of each other. To the north and east of Hurst castle, the water is not now making, nor has it for a very long time made, the smallest inroad upon the land, at any one single point. The slope toward the water is gene rally very gentle and gradual, and even when there are escarp ments of bolder character, these escarpments have generally VOL. II. HH"], [308, "234 THE NEW FOREST. some portion of under-cliff, or low and flat ground, between them and the ordinary high water mark. The beaches too are rarely found scoured by any strong action of the water ; and sand and gravel are by no means so much exposed at low water, as one would be prepared to expect on the shores of a district which is in great part composed of these for mations. The whole of these shores are in fact deposit-shores, upon which the quantity and quality of material left, depend very much upon the position of the line of shore, and the dis tance of the place from the point at which the depositations commence. From Hurst castle westward, on the other hand, the coasts present cliffs of various degrees of boldness, and composed of different beds of the tertiary formation. These are in a state of constant disintegration, partly by the direct action of the sea, but more by that of the weather, as acting immediately upon the face of the cliff, and by means of land springs upon the strata. In consequence of these circumstances, the two bays of which this westerly part of the coast is made up, do not contain a single harbour, or creek, or a safe anchorage, with the solitary exception of the harbour at Christchurch, which is partly defended from the \u2022fveather by the elevation of the Hengistbury head, and from the direct set of the tide, by the peculiar bend of the coast ; but which would long ere now have been choked up and ob literated had it not been for the quantity of water discharged by the united streams of the Avon and the Stour, and the scouring produced by the tide as it ebbs from the ample surface of the harbour. Excepting this, there is not along the whole seventeen miles, a safe accommodation for any species of craft ; and it is not in every state of the weather, that even the smugglers, daring and reckless as they are of life as well as of law, can venture to approach this perilous shore. The cliffs along these bays have in some places a height of from 150 to 200 feet; but they are destitute of every attribute both of picturesque effect and of every grandeur ; and the only general idea which they suggest is that of a"], [309, "235 THE NEW FOREST. progress of destruction, which man cannot arrest, but which creeps slowly on by that stealthy kind of march, which partakes not even of the grandeur of whelming ruin. The map would tell any one this, without an actual knowledge of the ground, only, unless cliffs were marked on the map, and it were not known that the sea is dispersing anel not gathering here, one would conclude that this part of the New Forest district was margined by dull flat beaches of sand ; for the curvature of both beaches is so regular, that any one would perceive the incompatibility of their out lines with such a rocky shore, as would impart anything like grandeur to the meeting of sea anel land. It has been stated that the average advance of the sea upon the land here is at the rate of about thirty feet annually, and that it is greatest in the deep bight to the eastward of Christ church. It must be admitted that, even though some at tempts have been made to force artificial ornaments upon the ground above these cliffs, there are not many places where the sea could carry on the work of demolition with less national loss ; for the land is naturally of a very sterile character ; and it is so scourged by the storms of the south and west, that no vegetation of great value could be raised upon it. There are comparatively few trees, and the very few that are met with, are dwarfed and stunted, and neither very ornamental, nor very useful. We shall, however, speak of the character of the surface afterwards. All sorts of weather conduce, in some degree, to the disin tegration of this bulwark of mud. If the rain beats against it, it soaks into the clayey and marly parts of the strata, and gives them a softness, so that they are in part pressed out by the harder strata of gravel ; while in drought, their di rect exposure to the heat of the mid-day sun, causes them to champ and open, so as more readily to admit the next rain which may come ; and also, if there should be frost, which is never very intense here, the clay is torn by the expan sion which the water in it undergoes in the act of congela tion. The wind may, perhaps however, be regarded as the hh 2"], [310, "236 the new forest. most powerful assailant; for it comes unbroken from the sea, and beats with great force along the whole face of the rampart, and is condensed, and deposits rain there and in the vicinity, in states of the weather, during which, if the transition from sea to land were gradual, not even a cloud would be formed. This is one reason why so much of the country immediately behind those cliffs is sterile on the heights, and has a tendency to marsh and bog in the hollows ; but by these very means, it, in all probability, conduces not a little to the advantage of the whole county, by breaking the violence of the storms so near the coast. The curvature of the bays, of course aggravates the local mischief, but at the same time tends '.proportionately to the general conservation. It is the increase of bight, or curva ture, in these bays, more especially in that of Christchurch, which has occasioned, and still continues to occasion, the lengthening of the shingle causeway at Hurst castle ; and that again is the cause of the very different character of the coasts to the eastward and northward of that castle, as well as the increased demolition of the coast of the Isle of Wight from the Needles eastward. The sea does not come fully up to the base of the cliffs even at high water : for there is a tidal beach of sand and gravel along the whole or the greater part of the line. This beach does not how ever, increase in breadth, and diminish in slope, in propor tion to the demolition which is going on ; for great part of the heavier matters is carried to the shingle banks, while the lighter matters are carried round Hurst castle, and gradually dropped in the eddy. Such are the outlines of almost all that can be said of the western part of the coast of the New Forest ; and from this it will appear that there is but small attraction either in the physical cha racters or in the -scenery. The north and east coasts are very different in their phy sical character ; and both in a social and scenic point of view., they are far more interesting ; nor is it easy to imagine a place where so much effect is produced by the blending of"], [311, "237 THE NEW FOREST. land and water, and copse and glade. It is true that, in this again, there is nothing grand or picturesque, although no one can refuse to admit that those blendings of land and water, wood and wild, are exceedingly beautiful ; and as the water makes its appearance in many situations where no one would suppose that it has the best connection with the sea, the country here, especially that opposite to the Isle of Wight has what may be considered a very unnatural character in nature, namely, an assemblage of lakes with clean banks, and embodied among trees, but without the usual concomi tants of mountains and rocks. This, it must be admitted, is a little out of nature ; and one who has been accustomed to see and examine the component parts of scenery in their harmonious connection, would be apt to come to the conclu sion that some art must have been practiced before those sweet little lakes could have an existence in places which are otherwise so very unlakelike. If one lingers a few hours, or returns after a few hours have elapsed, one is apt to suppose that there is something here analagous to those lakes in Southern Austria which alternately drink and return their waters according to the season ; for, in this brief space of time, the supposed lake will have vanished, and in its place there will remain that which has very much the appearance of a green meadow, from the thick covering of marine vege tation upon the spots from which the water has withdrawn. The sea odour, however, which is most conspicuous when the tide has retired, very soon lets one know that those fancied lakes, are nothing more than sinuous creeks into which the tide flows, and which are laid dry at its every ebb. The bank which is deposited along the whole line of the coast from Redbridge to Hurst castle, and which varies in breadth and in consistency in different places, but generally becomes broader and softer from Redbridge to Calshot, and from Calshot to Hurst, is the feature of this coast which forms the most striking contrast with the portion towards the west. In the upper part, that is from Redbridge to South ampton, it is nowhere much above a furlong in breadth, and"], [312, "238 THE NEW FOREST. its consistence is firm ; and along the whole line of the South ampton Water as far as Calshot, there is no creek or harbour, with the exception of that at Eling, about three quarters of a mile to the south of Redbridge, and formed in the estuary of a few small streams which meet in one channel here. This creek has a considerable depth of water ; and for local trade, as well as for ship-building, it is one of the best little har bours in the whole of the district. The country between the Southampton Water and the af forested grounds, is very beautiful all the way from Eling to Calshot; and some places are much resorted to for sea bathing. Newton, about a mile farther down than Eling and opposite to the village of Millbrook is a pleasant station aud so is Marchwood about three quarters of a mile still farther clown. Another three quarters of a mile brings one to Cracknor ferry, seven furlongs directly west from Southampton har bour. The Hard here approaches. From the harbour of Southampton to Cracknor, is the shortest passage from the great London road to the New Forest, and it leads by an easy course to some of the most delightful spots, both of the forest land, and that which is in the hands of individuals. Nor is there any doubt that when the completion of the London and Southampton Railway shall have made its line the grand channel of pleasure touring with France and all the southern parts of the continent, it is by no means un likely that many of them may be induced to take a portion of their own country in their way, and proceed by this ferry through the New Forest and the Isle of Wight, than which there are few short excursions better fitted for rewarding the labour of those who may be tasteful enough to undertake it. At Hythe, about two miles and a half below Cracknor, and opposite to the ruins of Netley abbey, there is another land ing place for boats ; but the beach along the whole of this line of the coast is so shelving that there is no landing place for vessels except the very lightest craft, which, however, can lie upon the beach with perfect safety, to meet the re turn of the tide, which is double on all parts of this coast,"], [313, "239 THE NEW FOREST to the extent mentioned in a former chapter of this vo lume. The line of coast from Calshot to Hurst, as it is the longest, is also by far the most interesting of any that mar gin the New Forest district. The whole line of it is pro tected from every wind that can possibly blow; and it is more especially a shore of repose than any other in the British islands, numerous and varied as these shores are. The north-east, and the south-west are the winds which have the most direct access to it ; but the violence of both of them is turned upon the opposite shore of the Isle of Wight, which, from Cowes, westward, is just as much scourged by both wind and tide as this coast is protected. The currents of the air and the sea have not the same causes, neither do they exactly follow the same laws ; but yet, as tbe blast rides upon the billow, there is always as much concert of action between them, as that we can judge of the general action of the one by that of the other. If, for instance, in approaching the sea, one finds the boles of the trees bent inland, the seaward side almost denuded of branches and spray, and the little that there is crushed in upon the stem, one may be sure that the sea will be found lashing the beach even in its ordinary states, and thundering upon it when the majesty of the storm is up. If, on the other hand, the trees \" stand equally \" upon their stems as one approaches the coast, one may be sure that there is no invasion of the land by the sea in such a locality ; but that, if the sea commits devastation anywhere in the neighbourhood, the spoils of the disintegrated land will be left upon that part of the coast where the foliage of the trees inclines as much to seaward and is as healthy there as in any other direction. This is the case upon the whole of the New Forest shore, from Eling all the way to Hurst castle ; for, along all that line, the foliage upon the sea ward sides of the trees is full and vigorous as it is upon the sides toward the land, and the boles of them have no leaning from the sea, any more than they have in any other"], [314, "240 THE NEW FOREST. direction. On the opposite side of the Southampton Water, below the estuary of the Itchen, as may be seen by any one who takes the delightful walk from Itchen ferry along the beach to Netley, the influence of the sea air is very diffe rent ; for the trees, of whatever species they may be, are bent inland and stunted, so that they are disfigurements rather than ornaments to the scenery. It is true that, from the small breadth of the sea, this tree-destroying influence does not extend far inland \u2014 probably not a furlong from the beach : but along the line of that, it is very conspicuous, and makes a wonderful contrast with the luxuriant foliage down to the high-water mark, on some parts of the opposite shore of the same tidal estuary. Nor will the observant tourist fail to remark that, where this action of the sea air is visible in the stunting and bending of the trees, the tide leaves evidence of being more angry upon the beach than it is in those places where the trees have the same uniform appearance upon all sides, as if they were in an inland situ ation. That portion of the New Forest district shore, which lies between Calshot and Hurst is, however, the one upon which the shelter and repose to which we have alluded are the most remarkable ; and for those who wish to have the freshness of the sea without any of its violence, perhaps this line is unrivalled by any sea-line in the United Kingdom. The sea does no more injury to even the most delicate vege tation than if it were a fresh-water lake of the most pure and limpid character ; and it is without the monotony which is produced by the uniform and unvaried level of the water in such a lake. The chlorine vapour of the sea, has an effect upon the constitution of animals very different from the merely aqueous vapour which arises from an inland or fresh-water lake; and, unless this is driven against trees or other vegetables by the fury of an angry wind, it is by no means hurtful even to them. The miasmata arising from fresh water, when the plants begin to decay, and when the small seasonal animals are putrifying, is always injurious to"], [315, "241 THE NEW FOREST. animal life. But if the ground is flooded or otherwise kept in a humid state by salt water, this deleterous effect is more felt, whatever may be the kind or state of the vegetation- After the sea has been excluded, the salt-marsh no doubt, loses a portion of its salubrity, by forming to a certain ex tent a fresh-water marsh ; for the surface-water when upon such a marsh, is not only fresh, but the water which peru lates from the sea to the roots of the plants is in a great measure filtered from its saline ingredients. Thus, while there is nothing of an unhealthy nature in a tidal beach, to whatever distance the sea may retire from it, the same can not be said of some of the very same portion of beach, after it has once been enclosed and drained, or otherwise re ceived from the sea. It is probable that Romney marsh in Kent, has been formed by the same kind of action which is now constantly encreasing the extent of tidal beach on the Solent coast of the New Forest, and that, while the sea overflowed it at every tide it was perfectly wholesome ; but now, notwithstanding its fertility, as a pasture ground es pecially, it does produce marsh diseases, which extend to some distance over the adjoining parts of the weald. From disease of this kinel the Solent coast of the New Forest is entirely free, notwithstanding the extent and sludginess of its muddy beach. It is a circumstance worthy of attention that, while the de composition of land plants in water always proeluces an un wholesome air, no such result proceeds from the exposing of marine plants to the direct action of the atmosphere. This is true, not only of marine plants, but of the conferv\u00e6 .and others, whose habit it is to grow in running streams, anel to be wholly or chiefly submerged by the current. These ac tually purify the water ; as any one may see upon examining a portion of the course of a small river which flows through a rich and varied district. If at any place such a river is, by slovenly management or otherwise, allowed to stagnate upon the meadows, these, whatever may be the climate, very soon become covered with a stratum of peat, the water gets VOL. II. II"], [316, "242 THE NEW FOREST. a brownish tinge, and the air becomes unwholesome. But if the water is again collected, and runs with even moderate velocity through a bed of conferv\u00e6, it becomes clear as crystal, and the banks are clad with kindly vegetation. These changes may be seen occurring again and again in any of the south-running rivers in Hampshire, where one can pass from the mossy tint to the limpid water, in a very short distance. The Solent has, upon the banks which margin the south east of the New Forest, an action which may be said to be compounded of a fluminal and a tidal action. The current of the tide races in both directions like that of a river, with a po sitive transfer of the water, and not a mere propagated wave ; and then, along with this current, there is an ebbing and flow ing four times in the course of the lunar day, owing to those peculiarities of the coast and tide, which we have endeavour eel to explain in a former chapter. This continual succession of action, prevents any substance from remaining and putre fying upon any part of the surface ; and thus, but for the marine odour, Which is wholesome if not agreeable to every one, the air from these shores is peculiarly refreshing. There is another matter connected with these mud-banks, which is worthy of notice, from the influence which it has on the climate : \u2014 when the tide retires there is more vapour from the mud and sand, with which the surface is covered, than there would be from an equal extent of water; and thus the bank sends a refreshing air toward the land, greater in proportion as the air is stilly and the action of the sum mer sun intense. Then, in winter, the state of things is reversed ; for when rain or sleet falls upon the bank and saturates the surface of it with fresh water, the returning tide produces an elevation of temperature upon it by the salt water mingling with the fresh\u2014 just as takes place at the top of the brackish water in the tidal estuary of a river. This would, if the soil were favourable for depositing the spawn of fishes, be very advantageous to tbe vitality of that. But the constant depositing of new matter prevents fish from"], [317, "243 THE NEW FOREST. resorting to this shore in any considerable numbers, or of any very valuable species ; and the quantity of lime in the silt renders that not the most favourable for molluscous ani mals ; and thus the banks are not so rich in animal life as one would be apt to suppose. But there are circumstances which render these banks peculiarly favourable for dabbling, or flat-billed birds, vast numbers of which resort to these places in the winter ; and the capture of them helps to eke out the scanty livings of the fishermen along the coast. The current in the Channel, and the frequent ebbing and flowing of the tide, with the increase of temperature to which we have alluded, prevent any decided effect of win ter upon these banks, even when the weather is most se vere ; and the consequence is a vast assemblage of wild ducks whenever the cold is intense. The fishermen look upon such times as seasons of harvest to them ; but it is a harvest the reaping of which is very laborious. It is chiefly during the night that the fowling is carried on ; and it would be difficult to imagine a more laborious occupation. The banks cannot be walked over without mud-pattens, or boards fasteneel to the feet something in the same manner as the snow-shoes of the northern nations. Even with the help of these, they do not range over the mud in search of their game, for wild ducks are very wary birds and cannot be successfully approached in this way, The plan is, to bore silently along the creeks or runs in the sludge ; and this is a laborious matter in consequence of the sinuosities of the runs, and the softness of their banks. Owing to the former, the boat is very apt to get aground ; and, owing to the latter, it cannot be pushed off again by oar or boat-hook, as can be done when the banks are firm. Thus, when the boat does ground, there is no alternative but for the boat man to get into the water and push it off. In a cold win ter's night, this is not the most agreeable office ; and thus the boatman pays dearly for his ducks ; \u2014 not only this, for he sometimes takes wrong ground, and then all his labour is in vain. Long duck-guns are the weapons used ; and if ii 2"], [318, "244 THE NEW FOREST. there is only one man in the boat, he must have two or three, in order to have even a tolerable chance of success. None, indeed, can \"enjoy\" this sport but men who have been regularly bred to it ; and it is doubtful whether they could possibly choose a more laborious and less profitable occupation. The situation and the distance of the birds have both to be judged of by the \" clack \" which they make in feeding, and this requires a practised ear in order to be anything like certain of success. When the fowler judges, by the clack, of the direction of the ducks, and the fact of his being within proper distance of them, he discharges one of his guns in the direction of the sound, without expecting to do much more than raise the ducks ; and immediately upon this he fires his other gun in the direction of the sound of the wings. I his second shot is sometimes suc cessful, and sometimes not ; and the fowler has to scramble over the cold sludge in quest of his game, which he some times does not find until daylight, and after the flowing tide has brought it to the shore, or stranded it upon the more elevated parts of the banks, which have again to be exa mined when the tide ebbs during the day ; so that, taking it with all its circumstances, this is one of the most la borious, unpleasant, and unprofitable occupations in which any human being can be engaged ; and would not be fol lowed in any place where there was regular employment for the working people. It has none of the fearful grandeur of the rock fowding which is practised upon the precipitous shores of the northern isles, but it is far more severe ; and the following anecdote, which we quote from Gilpin, an author whose language it would be hazardous to alter, will show that it is not without its horrors. \" Mounted on his mud-pattens, he (the fowler) was traversing one of those mudland plains in quest of ducks ; and being intent only on his game, he suddenly found the water, which had been brought forward with uncommon rapidity by some peculiar circumstance of tide and wind, had made an alarming pro gress around him. Encumbered as his feet were, he could"], [319, "245 THE NEW FOREST. not exert much expeelition ; but to whatever part he ran he found himself completely invested by the tide. In this un comfortable situation, a thought struck him as the only hope of safety. He retired to that part of the plain which seemed the highest, from its being yet uncovered by the water ; and, sticking the barrel of his gun (which for the purpose of shooting wild-fowl was very long) deep into the mud, he resolved to hold fast by it, as a support as well as a security against the waves, and to wait the ebbing of the tide. A common tide, he had reason to believe, would not in that place have reached above his middle ; but as this was a spring-tide, and brought in with so strong a current, he durst hardly expect so favourable a conclusion. In the mean time, the water, making a rapid advance, had now reached him: it covered the ground on which he stood, it rippled over his feet, it gained his knees, \u2014 his waist, button after button was swallowed up, till at length it advanced over his very shoulders. With a palpitating heart he gave himself up for lost. Still however, he held fast by his an chor : his eye was eagerly in search of some boat which might take its course that way ; but none appeared. A solitary head, floating on the water, and that sometimes covered by a wave, was no object to be descried from the shore at the distance of a league ; nor could he exert any sounds of distress that could be heard so far. While he was thus making up his mind, as the exigence would allow, to the terrors of sudden destruction, his attention was called to a new object. He thought he saw the uppermost button of his coat begin to appear. No mariner floating on a wreck could behold a cape at sea with greater transport than he did the uppermost button of his coat. But the fluctuation of the water was such, and the turn of the tide so slow, that it was yet some time before he durst venture to assure himself that the button was fairly above the level of the flood. At length, however, a second button appear ing at intervals, his sensations may rather be conceived than described, and his joy gave him spirits and resolution to"], [320, "246 THE NEW FOREST. support his uneasy situation four or five hours longer, till the waters had fully retired.\" \u2014 Forest Scenery, Vol. II. One ofthe places where aquatic birds are found in great est abundance, is near the entrance of the Beaulieu river, where the banks have considerable depth. This neighbour hood is not only a great winter resort for common wild ducks, and many other members of the Anas family, for numbers of ducks, widgeons, teal, and other species, as well as many of the running and wading birds, frequent the marshy and sedgy margins of the creeks, the pools along the streams and rivers, and those which are inland among the moors. The Beaulieu river itself is a remarkable inlet, both on account of the length to which it penetrates inland, the numerous windings of its course, and the beauty of the woods upon its banks. As a river, we shall speak of it afterwards ; but we may mention as connected with the shore, that, at low-water, the entrance is first straight towards the land about half-a-mile, then westward, bending a little to the north, to Exbury, where the first road crosses. From Exbury, its direction is north-westward for about four miles to Beaulieu; and about half-a-mile above Beaulieu, the banks contract, and it ceases to have tidal beaches of any extent. From Exbury upward, the width varies from a furlong to a quarter of a mile, at high-water, while the channel, at low- water, is not above a hundred yards across ; and thus a considerable extent of mud is laid bare at every ebb-tide. The mud in this, and indeed in all the creeks which receive the streams of the south-east part of the New Forest, is not brought down and deposited by the stream \u2014 for the remote feeders of that have their sources in the cold and hungry patch of crag which occupies the eastern cen tral part of the district ; and therefore, except a small quan tity of sand, with moss, and a solution of oxide of iron, there is little which these streams can bring down. No part of the estuary of the Beaulieu river is within the afforested lands until about a mile and a half to the northward of Beaulieu, where the sterile moors, and the ramifications of"], [321, "247 THE NEW FOREST. the brooks over them begin. Rather more than two miles east of Exbury, a stream of some magnitude enters the So lent. This is called Dark Water, from the deep tinge that its waters receive from the moss and iron of the sterile tract of Beaulieu heath. The lower part of it is tidal for some considerable distance ; and the banks afford cover in sum mer for the nesting places of many aquatic birds, which is also the case with some of the pools on the heath. Between this and Calshot castle, there are several other brooks of smaller dimensions, and all of them have the banks marshy, and tide-ways of some extent or other. The same holds true with the brooks to the westward of the Beaulieu river, though in a less degree, as the shore is in general a little higher. To the westward of Lymington river, the land is still more elevated ; and though the banks are of considerable breadth, there is not such cover for birds inland as upon the shore farther to the east. The tideway of the Lymington river is about two miles and a quarter from the seaward edge of the banks to the harbour ; and the tidal action above this is prevented by an artificial em bankment to be noticed afterwards. Taken in all its characters, this portion of shore from Calshot to Hurst castle may be regarded as the most inte resting in the New Forest district, whether we regard the diversified surface, the blending of land and water, the fine. ness of the climate, or the beauty of much of the scenery. And, an examination of the country within this coast, would alone suffice to refute the vulgar opinion as to the desola tion which the Conqueror and his successor are alleged to have spread over this district of fields, orchards, and churches. Whether we take it as toward the Southampton Water or toward the Solent, all the rich lands, though some are nomi nally within the precincts, are really settled and inhabited, and appear to have been so even before the afforestation ; while the commencement of the forest and of the sterile crag, which is really not worthy or indeed susceptible of culture, is always at the same point; and it will be found"], [322, "248 . THE NEW FOREST. that this, though not invariably, is yet generally, the case upon all sides, \u2014 there is a marking out by nature, in a cha racter of soil which could not have been cultivated in early times when men had no fortunes to expend in the improve ment of waste lands ; and, wdiere there are fertile spots within the forest, they appear to have been too remote in the early times for being inhabiteel, and many of them are now held by private individuals upon various tenures, or in vir tue of their offices in the forest. Of these we shall take some notice when we come to treat of the forest as such, and independently of natural circumstances. SURFACE, SOIL, AND RIVERS. If we leave out of consideration, the diversified margins, and the contrasts of sterile heath, natural wood, glade, and cultivated field, which it presents, and regard the New Fo rest district simply as a portion of the earth's surface, and in its natural features and capabilities as such ; it is one of the most dreary and monotonous which one can meet with, excepting perhaps the sands and barrens of Africa, and the steppes of Siberia. Just imagine the vegetation gone, and there will be nothing but the wind of desolation howling over a dingy expanse of sand, clay, and gravel, with scarcely an acre in which a useful plant could take root. In so far as the surface consists of crag, which it may be said to do, from Hythe to near Lyndhurst, and thence southward to the east of Lymington, with the exception of a border of about a mile and a half along the Southampton Water, and a very irregular one, averaging about three miles, along the Solent, \u2014 in so far as the surface consists of this, it is the most dull and uninteresting of all surfaces ; for, in hardly any place where it occurs, does it attain an elevation de serving to be called a hill, or even a bank with so abrupt a slope as to produce a contrast. In some other places, the surface is more diversified, and the soil a little better, but there is no part which can be re garded as belonging to even the better description of the"], [323, "249 THE NEW FOREST. tertiary formation. Over almost the wdiole of it, the soil is retentive, and often strongly impregnated with iron, so that the heights are naturally naked, and the hollows or bottoms marshy. Whenever mould of a more kindly description occurs, its for mation is to be attributed to the woods and the atmosphere, rather than to the soil. A surface so flat, so retentive, and consequently so much cooled by evaporation, and exposed to the current of the humid air from the Atlantic, naturally brings upon itself a considerable quantity of rain, with a corresponding violence of the winds ; and the consequence is, that the naked heights are scourged, and the debris is carried into the hollows, where it increases the retention of moisture and lays the foundation for those miry formations which occur in the bottoms, and which are as unfavourable to the growth of useful trees, as they are to that of the pasture grasses, or to the health or safety of herds or flocks. The woods, where these exist, form a soil of their own, by the annual shedding of their leaves : and, they not only preserve this, but retain all the soil from the more exposed places, which is blown into them ; and they are thus the only natural means, by which almost any part of the district has been, or can be, covered with a soil at all productive. Even they are, in many places, unable to contend with the deferti lizing nature of the subsoil ; for if there is but little shelter, as there always must be at the margin of a wood, and if at the same time the form and texture of the surface are such as to make the water stagnant, the iron-impregnated water actually eats away the mould which the trees produce, in the same manner as if a caustic were applied to the ground ; and then the trees are the most starveling things that can well be imagined, \u2014 of such there are very many speci mens upon the margins of the moors in this district. In a district of such peculiar character, it is not very easy to trace summit-levels, or to convey or even obtain anything like a clear notion of the inclinations of the various portions. But, with the exception of the valley of the Avon, no part of VOL. II. KK"], [324, "250 THE NEW FOREST. which is within the afforested portion, the greater part may be said to have its principal slope to the south-east, toward the Solent ; for the slopes toward the Southampton Water, and the country to the west of Redbridge, are very narrow ; and the north-west which abuts on Wilts lies high. In order to form some general idea, we shall not be very far wrong, if we begin at Eaglehurst, on the Solent, about a mile and a half west of Calshot castle, and trace along the boundary of the forest, at about the same distance from the Southampton Water, passing Fawley at the end of about two miles, and Dibden, at the end of nearly seven. Then pass ing through Langley wood, at about two miles south of Red bridge, to Lyndhurst, at about three miles from the former, and so by Costic's pond, Minsted lodge, Rufus's stone, and Long-beech, to a point about six miles east-and-by-south of Fordingbridge, we shall have the line of the summit level, along the whole north-east of the forest, nearly on the margin of the afforested lands, till the Lyndhurst road is arrived at, and then through the forest itself to the point to which we have alluded, and which is about a mile and a half to the right of the road in passing to Ringwood, and not above two miles and a half from the boundary of the forest and county, to the eastward of the Bramshaw telagraph. Thence, the summit-level extends north-westward to beyond the boundary of the district, and forms the summit-level be tween the valley of the Test and that of the Avon. From the same point the level extends southward over the dreary heights of Ocknell and Bratley plains, separating the sources of the New Forest rivers and streams from the eastern branches of the Avon, until after a length of about fourteen miles, it meets the sea at High cliff, about two miles to the eastward of the entrance to Christchurch harbour. This summit-level, which in itself is dull and tame, and at many places sterile, surrounds the forest on the north-east and west, in the form an an irregular loop, having its greatest general elevation on the north-west part towards the border of Wilts ; and the finest parts of the forest itself"], [325, "251 THE NEW FOREST. are those toward this quarter. From different parts of the inner curve of this summit-level the small rivers of the dis trict have their sources ; and in dry weather the nut-brown waters creep slowly along between the spurs or hursts which ramify from this summit to near the sea, the general course of all the principal ones being in the direction of south east, \u2014 as if the inbreak of the sea-flood which brought the tertiary formation over the chalk in this part of England had come from that quarter. The fall of all those rivers and streams is very trifling, so that they overflow part of the moors in the rainy season ; and the pools thus formed are in part left to be taken up in evaporation, which greatly increases the cold at those times, while out of the reach of the sea-breeze and the shade of the woods, the heat in the summer drought is very oppressive. The first valley, or bottom, or depression, or whatever else it may be termed, among these ramifications of the heights, is that which contains the stream of Dark water. This stream consists of the waters of several small brooks, which have their sources in the southern part of Beaulieu heath ; but the remotest of them are not above six miles from the confluence of the water with the Solent, a little to the eastward of the Beaulieu river, as already noticed. There are some marshy pools upon the upper rivulets in the heath ; but they are of small dimensions, and have not much inte rest, only in so far as they are the resort of wading or swim ming birds. The character of the creek formed by the lower part of this river has been already noticed. The Beaulieu river, from the length of its course and the beauty of the scenery along its winding estuary, is far more interesting. The total length of its course, exclusive of the minor windings, is about twelve miles ; and it drains the surface-water of the greatest extent of the crag surface, and the margins of the tertiary formation by which that is sur rounded. As is the case with Dark water, the supplies which, in ordinary states of the weather, are sent to the Beaulieu river, are from small marshes, pools, and hollows, kk 2"], [326, "252 THE NEW FOREST. and they tainted by the colouring matters peculiar to the formation ; nor is there, in the crag formation, or indeed in almost any part of the forest district, a spring of clear water, which pours out a quantity meriting the appellation of even a rill. The upper part of the shallow basin which this river drains, is something in the form of a circle, about four miles from the union of the branches above Beaulieu to the northern summit, and about the same, from Dibden on the east to near Lyndhurst on the west. In this upper part, the Beaulieu river has no beauty ; and what it has in the estua ral portion, is chiefly owing to the sea and the woods on the shores. Indeed, it may be said of all tbe inland parts that, in so far as the New Forest is beautiful, it is so because it is a forest ; and were it once disafforested, it would be a most uninteresting and unprofitable district, We shall afterwards see to what extent the forest does, or might, redeem it from this character. The Lymington river, which is sometimes called the Bol dre, from the parish of that name on its banks, is, however, the largest running water which has its rise in the New Forest district. Its most remote source is very near that point to the westward of the place where Rufus was shot, which we have mentioned as being that at which the north eastern and the western lines of general summit-level meet and pass northward to the downs of South Wilts ; and the various brooks drain all the surface-water from the south ward slope of the richly wooded, part of the forest to the north and west of Lyndhurst. This' river crosses the line of road from Lyndhurst to Lymington, about half-a-mile to the north of the village of Brockenhurst ; and quits the affo rested lands about three or four miles above Lymington. Only a small portion of the surface which the river drains is on the crag formation ; and it is accordingly not quite so bare and sterile as that on the upper part of the Beaulieu river, and there are some very pleasant spots within it ; but still many are barren heath or useless marsh or mire \u2014 or alternately the one or the other, according as it is the dry"], [327, "253 THE NEW FOREST. or the rainy time of the year. The water, too, is of the same dingy and tainted character ; quite unfavourable to the breeding of fish ; and, we believe, by no means suited for the wholesome irrigation of water-meadows, even if the banks were well adapted for these in the position of their surface. Some process of this kind was tried immediately above Lymington, and the tide was banked out in order to give scope to the water of the river without any blending of saline mixture, \u2014 the which mixture is the only ingredient wanted to give the deposit of such a stream even a chance of kindly fertility. It is not, of course, the mere water of any river, be that of what purity it may, which nourishes the grass upon water-meadows ; for, if the same water is sent from meadow to meadow, without being turned into the main channels at intervals, those which are lowest derive but little advantage from the process ; and if the water which is spread over the meadow is hnpregnated with salts of iron, the spor\u00e6 of the mosses, and the earth of decomposed peat and heath, it must necessarily act as a bane and not as a bounty ; and if such a bath were given for a very short time to a mea- dow previously covered with valuable grasses, that meadow would soon partake of the souring and unwholesome cha- racter of an incipient marsh. The chalk on the upper parts of the south-flowing rivers of Hampshire, is the earth which is most influential in preventing the formation of bog and the growth of marsh plants ; and though pure silicious sand would partially have the same influence, mere clay has not ; and therefore there is little good to be expected from streams which flow from such grounds as those that give rise to the rivers of the New Forest. Drainage, not irrigation, is what is wanted for the lands by such streams, if they are to be substantially improved. In the valleys of the Itchen, the Test, and the Avon, we find confirmations of what has been now stated ; for, with an equal degree of stagnation, there is always a greater ten dency to the formation of marsh and the growth of marsh plants the farther that the place is removed from the chalk."], [328, "254 THE NEW FOREST. On the banks of the New Forest rivers, above the tideway, there is nothing of a very wholesome nature that the stream can bring down \u2014 except, perhaps, during heavy floods ; and what may be brought then, is only a certain robbing of one part of the surface for the very questionable benefit of another. Warping in the tidal estuaries might have a much more beneficial effect, although they might not, in all proba bility be anything comparable to the results of the same system in the midland counties. The only other river wholly within the New Forest dis trict, which it will be necessary to notice, is the Avon \u2014 not the river which comes from Wilts, and is joined by the Stour at Christchurch ; but a small stream that runs into the So lent, immediately to the eastward of the natural causeway, upon the extremity of which Hurst castle is situated. This stream rises in the south-west part of the Forest, near Holms ley lodge, and flows south-eastward, with a pretty straight course for only about eight or nine miles, to the sea, the lower part passing through the Lymington salterns, which were of no small importance before the rock-salt in Cheshire and Worcestershire was manufactured to the same extent that it is now. This little river may be considered as a single stream, with scarcely one lateral branch, and of small value except in so far as it determines the slope of that portion of the district, across which it flows. Between it and the most southerly of the western or right-hand branches of the Lymington river, there is a considerable extent of furzy moor ; and no part of the land in the neighbourhood is very fertile, nor are almost any spots of the surface to be ad mired for their beauty. The chief inducement which any one can have to reside in this part of the New Forest dis trict which extends southward from the afforested lands to the mud cliffs of Christchurch bay, upon which the sea is making such constant though gradual depredations, is the benefit of the sea-air, and of that they have abundance \u2014 the exposure to the southwest being direct, and the violence of"], [329, "255 THE NEW FOREST. the atmosphere such, that a shelter of any description of timber cannot be obtained without great difficulty. Such are the natural characters of the soil, the surface, and the rivers of the New Forest district ; and the climate is in exact correspondence : for, unless there is shelter by woods or heights, the sea-wind sweeps over and scourges the surface ; and, unless where the distance inland is con siderable, the seaward sides of the woods are beaten into a very stunted and miserable appearance. The bleak heights which occupy the south-west of the district, and the heights which lie north-west and south-east, between the course of the lesser Avon and the most southerly left-hand branch of the Lymington river, take off the severity of the sea-breezes \u2014 or rather the sea-storms, before the latter part of the forest is reached ; and the termination of the same, with the jetting extremities between the sources of the south-east rivers/ afford shelter to the low grounds near the Solent. But the general character which prevails over the whole district, with the exception of the north-eastern and south eastern margins, is one of sterility ; and much of the beauty which has been attributed to some of the scenes, is owing to the contrast of the miserable tracts with which they are in such close juxta-position. We can, of course, have no prejudice against any one part of the district, because, what ever may be its characters, they depend on natural circum stances, in which no human being has any part; and no man in his senses would find fault with nature for having made any district of country in any one state in which we find it. On the contrary, there is always a compensation in every part of creation, whether it be in the sea or the land, or in that which either of them produces ; and this must hold in the case of the New Forest, as well as in that of any other district. And here we may perhaps be allowed to make one pas sing reflection upon the vituperations which have been heaped upon William the Norman, for the supposed deso lating of this tract of country, and desecrating of churches"], [330, "256 \" * THE NEW FOREST. \u2014 which never could have existed, and cemetries \u2014 which never could have contained any bones, save those of warriors on the wild heath, \u2014 whose place of rest no churchman goes to consecrate, even though they fell while contending for the emoluments or the existence of the church. If William had not afforested the central and northern parts of the district, and thus ensured the preservation of the wood upon them, they would, long ere now, have been converted into one dis mal expanse of unbroken heath, across which the storms would have come in all their fury, and extended their deso lation over the greater part of the county of Hants. We do not mean to say that William had any such intention, or even that he had the slightest knowledge of any matter of the kind ; for those who have most to do with the govern ment of states, are usually the most ignorant of the laws and workings of nature, and natural science had no exist ence or name at the time to which we allude. But there is a higher power, the working of which is generally inscru table to us, which turns even the folly and the vice of the men of one generation to the advantage of those who come after, when a more clear and extended light dawns upon the earth. Some other reflections of a physico-moral nature will readily suggest themselves to any reader of ordinary intelligence, or any one who visits this district with powers of observation beyond the most \"brute and vulgar gaze;\" but into these neither our space nor our principal object will allow us to enter. Our proper business is, with the present, anel with such memorials of the past as our very limited room will allow us to glean. In the discharge of this part of our duty, we shall notice the topographical, statistical, and some of the historical details \u2014 first of the districts which form the purlieus of the Forest, anel then the Forest itself. VALLEY OF THE AVON. According to the latest arrangement of the divisions and subdivisions of Hants, the artificial boundaries of this part"], [331, "257 THE NEW FOREST. of the district very nearly correspond with the natural ones, than in any other part of the county. From the mouth of the brook of Chuton, about three miles to the eastward of the town of Christchurch, and only a little to the east of High cliff, which we have mentioned on the commencement of the summit-level, or natural boundary on the' sea-line, the artificial boundary proceeds northward, passing very nearly along the summit-level to near the Bramshaw telegraph, on the borders of Wilts. The average length of the whole of this valley may be about 18 miles, and the average breadth about 8 miles. It contains the following divisions : 1. Breamore liberty, a patch on the middle of the north end, consisting of only the single parish of Breamore, which, though near the high downs, is comparatively rich and populous, \u2014 the yearly valuation being 3126/., and the number of inhabitants 600. 2. Fordingbridge upper half-hundred, which lies on the west, south, and east of the former, but has a projecting tongue of Wilts between it and the west of Breamore liberty. On the right bank of the Avon, it extends to about a mile and a quarter below Fordingbridge ; and, on the left bank, the boundary stretches from that town to near the Bramshaw telegraph. Besides the town of Fordingbridge, which will be noticed afterwards, this division contains the parishes of Rookbourne in the western part, and of Hale in the eastern. Rookbourne, is a large parish; with a population of 517, and a yearly valuation of 2539/. Hale is smaller ; the annual valuation being 796/., and the population 203. Hale lies close on the left branch of the Avon, and the woods about Hale house are beautiful ; but the upper part of the parish is elevated downs. There are also very extensive downs in the north and west of the parish of Rookbourne. 3. Fordingbridge lower half-hundred lies wholly on the left bank of the Avon, along which it extends between four and five miles, and its eastern boundary is about the same length. A considerable portion of the east of this division is included in the afforested grounds, it being here, VOL II. LL"], [332, "258 THE NEW FOREST. in fact, that one of the best parts of the forest is situated. The cultivated surface between the Forest and the river is but narrow ; and though there 'are some villages anel cottages spotted over the greater part of its length, there are only two parishes, the churches of which are both situated near the south-west angle. These parishes are, Ibsley and El lingham. Ibsley has a population of 316, and the yearly valuation is 1551/. Ellingham is valued at 3342/. yearly, anel has a population of 420. 4. Ringwood hundred. This occupies the whole of the middle length of the valley, including a considerable por tion of the afforested lands in the eastern part, and extend ing to the bleak moors on the border of Dorset on the west. It occupies both sides of the Avon for a distance of about five miles from north to south ; and it stretches north, on the west or the right-hand side of the river, for about three miles more. Besides the town of Ringwood, it contains only one parish, that of Harbridge, on the right bank of the Avon, and not very far from the northern boundary of the hundred. Harbridge is an extensive parish, valued at 1931/., yearly, and containing 325 inhabitants ; but much of the surface is of a barren description. This is also the character of much of the eastern part of the hundred, which consists of an as semblage of knolls, destitute of timber, and far from rich in any kind of vegetation These knolls certainly form a con trast with the dull and monotonous heights of some parts of the Forest, but one can hardly call them an improvement. The greater part of the inhabitants of the hundred are in the extensive parish of Ringwood, which will be noticed afterwards, when we come to speak of the town. Christchurch lower half-hundred is a small patch ex tending across the valley, but of very irregular breadth. The only parish which it contains is Sopley, which has a population of 1012, and is valued at 1027/. yearly, which is a very small valuation in proportion to the number of in habitants. The western part of this half-hundred extends southward to the left bank of the Stour, which forms its boundary for about three miles."], [333, "259 THE NEW FOREST. 6. Westover liberty. This occupies a small portion of the extreme south-west of the county ; and about half the surface toward the west is occupied by the most dreary downs and heaths, with hummocks of sand along the shore in some places. At the mouth of the Bourne, a small stream which crosses the western part of it to the sea, there are decoys for the numerous wild fowl which frequent this dreary shore in the winter months. About a mile and a half to the east of the Bourne, is the villa of Bascombe, which is most redolent of sea-air, but in other respects, it is a dwelling in the wilderness. The north-eastern part of the liberty, toward the Stour, is better ; and the church of Hol denhurst, the only one in the liberty, is situated in that quarter. Holdenhurst is valued at 3714/. annually, and it has a population of 733. 7. Christchurch parliamentary liberty occupies the re mainder of the valley, lying on both sides of the river, and the tidal lake which forms Christchurch harbour. Its di mensions are 5| miles from east to west, and 4 from north to south ; but the form of it is irregular. Hinton is the only parish besides that of the borough of Christchurch. This, though it has a church, is only a tything of the parish of Christchurch, and its population is included in the return of that. These seven, hundreds, half-hundreds, and liberties, make up the whole of the western division of the New Forest, the petty sessions being held, and the poll taken at Ring wood, as the most central, and on that account the most convenient, for the whole of the long anel narrow district. This division occupies nearly half the surface of the en tire district of the New Forest ; and certainly as much, if not more, than was actually afforested at any one time. The east and west of it are in many places barren ; but the cen tre of it has the advantage of a river of considerable magni tude flowing along its whole length. In respect of the natural elements of fertility, it is therefore superior to the average of the Forest ; anel yet there are only ten parish ll 2"], [334, "260 THE NEW FOREST. churches in it, the parishes of which include some of the Forest lands. Therefore, we have only to look at this lower valley of the Avon upon the map, to note its physical advan tages, and to count the number of its churches, in order to see how perfectly inconsistent with the physical capabilities of the district, the demolitions laid to the charge of the Nor man Conqueror are. Total ignorance of the nature of the place, is the only excuse that can be set up for them ; and the security of this ignorance \u2014 which is the chief means by which nonsense can be confidently propagated, has pre vented the absurd violation of nature by those fetches to which they so frequently had recourse \u2014 the ascription of the feeding of two-and-sifty congregations to a miracle. If they had thought of this, there is no doubt that manna would have rained from heaven, crucifixes have been or dained to produce beeves, and muttons, and quartern loaves, and an image of the Virgin to weep barrels of ale and butts of metheglin, rather than that the first monarch who dared to thrust in the sickle and reap the harvest which, in the Anglo-Saxon time, had fatted the pious herd, should have gone without the measure of his iniquity being filled to the brim, in order that the consigning of him to endless, perdi tion might be a work pleasing in the sight of heaven. We again repeat, that we have no partiality for William, or for any of the Norman race ; but we do wish that the popular belief should be disabused of the nonsense of these menda cious monks ; for, in consequence of the leaven of their mis representations, which is mingled with the whole early his tory of the country, there is probably not one character or one transaction connected with it, that is seen by us in its proper light. There is no fixed law of human action ; and, on this account, a human action may be misunderstood or misrepresented without voluntary mendacity ; but when the misrepresentation involves a physical impossibility, no such plea can be admitted ; for the man who asserts this, will assert anything that wull answer his purpose. The doting persons who prowl about ruined abbeys, in adoration of"], [335, "261 THE NEW FOREST. fragments of old stones, are seldom possessed of much logi cal acumen ; and therefore they contribute their mite to the misleading of the public. The conduct of the religious themselves, is the best means which we have of judging in such matters. Now, before the Conquest, these religious had carried their ap proaches to the borders of the New Forest, at Redbridge on the north, and at Christchurch on the south ; and they had penetrated into the centre as far up the Lymington or Boldre water as Brokenhurst, which is equidistant from Eling and Hurst castle ; but it does not appear that they had founded any establishment within the bounds of what was made Fo rest, nor had they allocated themselves at Beaulieu, until the frightening of John in a dream made him establish the ab bey there, to appease the anger of Heaven and the abbots ; and from this we may fairly conclude, that the central part of the Forest, that is, the part which lies to the east, west, and north of Brockenhurst was not very tempting in those days, otherwise they would have contrived to get a slice of the best of it. The fact of there being no religious house at Beaulieu until after the Conquest, is of some use in throwing light upon the progressive natural history of that part of the district ; for it shows that the beauty and fertility of the es tuaral banks of the Beaulieu are owing to the sea, which has brought deposits to the shores, and not to the river, which has its course over the hungry crags, and could never be the means of fertilising any district. The soil over which the Lymington river flows is better, and so is that on the Avon. Thus, all the points which bear upon it tend to es tablish one character for the Forest part of the district, both before the afforestation and since. THE RIVER AVON. Although the Avon is not a Hampshire river, yet, as it is the largest that flows through any part of the county, and has a course within it not much shorter than that of the Itchen, and is a river of considerable magnitude when it"], [336, "262 THE NEW FOREST. enters, it is too important a natural feature for being over looked. The Avon is the largest river that has its source in the chalk districts of the south of England ; and, like the other rivers of these districts, it receives the chief supply of its water from these, \u2014 the branches from the tertiary forma tion, whether in the New Forest district, or between that and Salisbury, being small in comparison. Its waters thus partake of the purity usual in such rivers, although not quite so much down near the tide-wray, in consequence of the branches from the tertiary formation. In consequence of this, marsh plants are more apt to form upon its banks, than upon those of the rivers which receive no branches but from the chalk, and the gravel and soil which cap the heights of that formation. Though the general direction of the Avon is nearly a straight line, all the way from Salisbury to the harbour of Christchurch, its channel is very irregular, forming nume rous branches, which, in some places, stream the meadows with an intricacy that can hardly be described. The course is also sluggish, and thus the banks are the resort of great numbers of aquatic and littoral birds, not only in the winter, but in the breeding time, \u2014 there being very few summer or winter visitant or resident birds, that live and breed on the margin of such waters in England, which are not to be met with in some part of the valley of the Avon ; it is thus an excellent locality for those who may wish to study this highly interesting department of British Orni thology in the only school where it can be studied to advantage. As the numerous branches of the Avon may be said to receive all the waters given out by an area of about 900 square miles ; as many parts of this are high down or plain, upon which a good deal of rain falls ; and as much of the surface is well cultivated for throwing the rain speedily into the water-courses ; this river is very subject to floods, which, though they are not so violent as to tear up much of the banks, are yet sufficiently so for rendering the stream"], [337, "263 THE NEW FOREST. very unfit for navigation. There is abundance of water for making this river the means of an inland navigation, ramified along most of the valleys of south Wilts : but both the main channel of the river, and also the harbour of Christchurch are unfavourable for this purpose. The great earl of Clarendon, to whom Christchurch belonged in the reign of Charles II, saw the advantage that would result from a regular navigation between the bay of Christchurch and the city of Salisbury ; he accordingly had both river and harbour surveyed, by Yarrington and others, and they reported more favourably than seemly, upon both. The river was made navigable in consequence ; but their works were soon destroyed by a flood, and no subsequent attempt has been made to restore the navigation, There is no doubt that a canal could be made, though the soil in some places is not the best for canal cutting and embanking; but it is very questionable whether any skill and labour of man could make the harbour of Christchurch anything better than a sloop harbour in fine weather ; and this would be small inducement for the constructing of a canal. Salisbury appears to be particularly unfortunate in the matter of canals ; for the one from Southampton, which was attempted in the early part of the present century, was a complete failure. It is unfortunate that the harbour cannot be made to answer, for a canal there would be the means of great local improvements, to say nothing of any branch of trade which might result from it. \u2014 The Avon is a very good fishing river, \u2014 eels especially are very plentiful, and of ex cellent flavour. TOWNS UPON THE AVON. The towns, which we observed in speaking of the parishes and other particulars are, Fordingbridge, Reelbridge, and Christchurch, which we shall notice in their order from north to south. As each of these towns gives name to a hundred, we may conclude that they were places of some importance in the early times. The superiority of harbours"], [338, "264 THE NEW FOREST. was of much less consequence in those times than it is now as the boats put to sea only in the fine weather, and made their landing at almost any part of the shore, just as one would do with pleasure boats on a fine calm day. The selection of shores necessary for modern navigation has had far more influence upon the relative prosperity of various parts of the country than one would be apt to suppose. Fordingbridge is on the right bank of the river, imme diately below where it takes a remarkable flexure to the right, of about a mile in length, and only about a mile further up, there is a similar flexure to the left; the flat meadow here being about a mile in breadth, which is the average breadth of meadow all the way up to the boundary of the county, which is about seven miles above Fording bridge. In these meadows the river winds very much ; and it is probable that, anciently, the greater part of these broad meadows was an impassable marsh. Below the town, the meadows shift to the westward, so that the line measured hence, a little above the town on the east, to a little below it on the west, extends to nearly two miles. This hitch or shift, brings the firm banks of the river near to each other ; and this is the place of the modern \" bridge,\" and of the ancient \" ford;\" hence the names of which that of the town has obviously been compounded. There is no great thoroughfare from east to west across by this bridge in modern times ; and the road from Salisbury to Ringwood and Christchurch, which line shifts from the right to the left bank of the river, is' the principal one in any direc tion ; but there is no doubt that, in former times, this was a passage of some importance ; and the town was then larger than it is now. In summer it is a pleasant place, but the humid meadows render it rather cold in the winter. The principal street is a crooked one, which lies east and west, and there is a shorter one to the north. Besides the Avon, there are two brooks, from the downs to the north-west, which join each other and the river in Fordingbridge. The town has a weekly market on Saturday, and an annual fair"], [339, ": \" R D I n <\". iQBO ID (SE \u00a9MM \u00a9CHI \u25a0 JfincAarter si, /'./,. /..-, i /.-t //,, traf.ri.ct ..

The yearly valuation is 9452/., anel the 'population in 1831 was 2671, being only nine more than by the former census. This population includes that of the parish and the tithing of Godshill. This is an elevation about a mile and a half north-east of the town ; anel though it is now covered with trees, it was once here defended on one side by a double rampart and ditch, the natural escarpment on the other sides being sufficient for the ancient purposes of defence. -It has been conjectured that this might have been one of the entrenched camps of Cerelic, when he was working his way to Winchester, during twice the time of the siege of Ilicum ; but this of course is merely conjecture, though Cerdford, now Chardford, a little to the north, renders the conjecture not improbable. Ford ingbrielge is mentioned as having a church, two mills, anel thirty acres of meadow, at the time of the Doomsday Survey ; and this small number of acres, compared with the present extent of meadows, gives at least some probability to what we have stated respecting the ancient marsh. Other than the parish church, it does not appear that there ever was any sacerdotal establishment at Fordingbridge. Ringwood is about six miles below Fordingbridge, and on the left or opposite bank of the river, which is still more divided into channels among the meadows here, so that the roael westward leads to a succession of small bridges. The same road along the valley passes through both towns ; anel in addition to this, there is, through Ringwood, the main thoroughfare across the New Forest to Poole; and it is aline of considerable traffic. It was a place of some note in the time ofthe Romans, and is termed Regnum in the Itinerary of Antoninus. Rincevede, or Rinceivede, was the name at the time of the Conquest; and it is described as being a royal demesne in the time of King Edward. 'Ihe name implies that it was the king's wood, and the number of hogs for which it is slated as affording pannage, is a con firmation of the fact to which we have so often alluded, and upon which every thing connected with the New Forest VOL. II < MM"], [344, "266 the new forest. bears so forcibly, as to show pretty clearly that the said forest has not undergone any change, save that of the felling of timber, and the close influence of time, to which all countries and districts are subject, since a period anterior to even the arrival of the Romans. It has been said that this was called Regnum by Antoninus, from its being a station belonging to the Regni ; but \" Regni \" is certainly not very like a British word, although its etymology in the other way, is apparent enough. \" Ring,\" is still the pro nunciation of the word \" reign \" in those parts of the country where the Anglo-Saxon has been mixed more with the original Norse than with the Norman Frankish ; and although we have no very implicit faith in etymologies, we are very much inclined to hold to that which is nearest to the original. \u2014 Mais, chacun a son gout. From the thoroughfare, the courts baron and leet, the petty sessions, and the pollings, which are held at Ring wood, the town has a sort of metropolitan air about it, and it is more lively and bustling than Fordingbridge. It is also more populous, anel proportionally higher in annual value, \u2014 \u25a0 the population being 4832, and the yearly valuation, 15,772/. The increase of the population in the thirty years preceding 1831, was more than 1000. Ringwood has a weekly market on Wednesdays, and fairs on the 10th of July and the 11th of December. There are no historical events of much importance connected with the history of this town, which, as a story to be told, is more old than interesting. Besides the parish church, the vicarage of which is in the gift of King's college, Cambridge, there are chapels for more than one class of dissenters at Ringwood, and there is an endowed free-school in the town, Christchurch is, on several accounts, the most inte resting of the three towns in the Hampshire portion of the valk y of the Avon. It is a parliamentary borough, and a seaport; and there is some history connected with its castle, and a great deal with the church, and former priory, to which that church was the chapel.

Even there it cannot be very great, as the land is by no means of the richest quality ; but of course the sum given is only a very small portion of the actual amount. Christchurch is a very ancient borough, being noticed as such in Doomsday Book. It does not appear that the Romans had any post or station here, and there is some reason to suppose that, in those times, the valley of the Avon was so covered with mud and marsh, as not to be passable. The principal intercourse with it then appears to have been across the moors to the west ; and that there have been con tests there, in the early times, is indicated by the barrows which are spotted about on these wilds. Hengistbury head has at one time been an encampment, but when and by whom cannot now be made out. The same surveyor who planned the short-lived navigation of the Avon for Lord Clarendon, suggested the transfer of the king's shipping from Portsmouth to Christchurch ; and the strong encamp ment that might be formed at Hengistbury head, was one of the inducements. Twynen, Twinham, and Thuinam, the different ortho graphies of the Saxon name, seem to imply that the original town, or collection of dwellings, whatever they might be, stood upon \" two islands ; \" and such may have been the case ; for there are many small islands about, and some parts ofthe town are insular. Defence was the grand object in former times; and. next to the steep escarpment of a hill, the best defence was water. It is true that the present islands, whether in the Avon or the Stour, or after they have joined, are small, but when we consider the action of the sea and of two flooding rivers for a thousand years, we cannot be very confident, as to what may at one time, have been the condition of the place. We must not confound the mm 2"], [350, "268 THE NEW FOREST. ancient towns or boroughs with our notions of modern ones. The number of messuages as stated in Doomsday, is 31 in Thuinam. The present town, of which the principal part is on the east side of the tongue of land formed by the junction of the Avon and Stour, has been of course in a great part collected by the castle and the priory. Before the Conquest, and till the reign of Henry I, both town and castle \u2014 if castle there then was \u2014 were the property of the king. .Henry granted them to Redvers, a powerful baron, and a branch of the royal house ; and it is probable that he built and fortified the castle. This castle was never the principal residence of any very powerful baron ; for Redvers held Exeter and Caris brook along with this. Baldwin, the second earl, joined the party of Maude, and was defeated anel obliged to go abroad ; but when the quarrel was made up, he returned to his pos sessions, and lived to see the humiliation of the tyrant at Runnymede. Edward I became possessor of it, and by him it was made a parliamentary borough ; but did not send members for a long time, on account of the expense. It must be borne in mind that, elown to a comparatively late period, the parliament of England partook as much of the nature of a cloak as that of a, council. The lords were courtiers, and opposed the king- only when they were not satisfied with their share of the praise and the plunder: and the commons were mere assenters until the time of Elizabeth, when commercial wealth began to rival the wealth of the nobility. Some of the Saxon kings saw the advantages that would accrue from this balance, anel attempted to encourage trade. Athelstan, for instance, decreed, that three long voyages shoulel elevate him who made them to the rank of Thane. This Avas of course all that a king could do ; but a title, or anything that a monarch can confer, is of no value in commerce. Wealth, and the means of actually increasing it, by skill not by craft, by mutual benefit not by fraud and over-reaching, by liberality and not by the narrow parsi mony of a mere huckster, are the sinewTs of war in the"], [351, ""], [352, "7 TIME A IBB . .

Attendance in the House occupied the time of the representative bur- gesses, and there was no gain or glory which they could reap, and, therefore, they had to be paid by their consti- tuents, who had no representative when they were not able wt<^pay him. It must be admitted that the balance swung mightily to the other side, when the boroughs became pro- perty, which the owner used for his own gain or glory ; but the question is, in itself, a fluctuating one, and no man or system can long hold an even balance in it. From the time of Elizabeth to the \" Alteration of Elections' Act,\" two members wrent to parliament for Christchurch, and since then there goes one. The town is very pleasant in summer, and the high cliffs in the neighbourhood afford very delightful views. The weekly market is held on Monday ; and there are annual fairs on the 13th of June and the 17th of October. The road from Lymington to Poole, that along the Avon, and one from the centre of the forest, all meet at Christchurch, which is \" the town \" to its own district ; but that district is neither very extensive nor very rich. Christchurch Priory was an establishment of some im portance. At what period of the Saxon sway it was founded there are no means of ascertaining; but in the reign of Edward the Confessor, it was in possession of considerable lands and tithes here, and of some lands in the Isle of Wight. It was then dedicated to the Holy Trinity; and the fraternity consisted of a dean and twenty-four canons, the appointment of whom was immediately in the king. At that time, the church and other buildings were, probably, of very humble character, as appears to have been the case Avith most of the Saxon edifices. Here we may remark"], [354, "270 THE NEW FOREST. that, while the Saxon monarchs, appear to have striven who should bestow the largest grants of land upon the clergy, the early Normans were equally attentive to the giving of some splendour to the sacred architecture of the country. They probably, in some instances, made the church fine at the expense of the priest, and occasionally at that of the people ; but, although they supplanted the Saxon thanes, they did more, both for the country and the people, than the said thanes showed any disposition to do. There is no denying that the Saxons were gross and sensual in their tastes, and wanted the fire and elevation of the Norman character. Splendid buildings tend much to the elevation of the human character ; and there seems little reason to doubt that the churches built by the Normans did far more for the cause of religion among the people, than the grants made to the clergy by the Saxons. They also gave scope for talent upon one subject at least ; and if you give talent one subject, it will find others. The setting of talent above mere brute force is among the first steps of vital civilisation ; and though talent is not always associated with virtue, it is, upon the whole, less mean in its vices than the opposite. One may be horrified at the conduct of a man of talent, but never disgusted. Ralph Flambard, by whom the priory of Christchurch was begun to be built in an elegant style, was an instance of this. He was of humble origin, but of great talents, and fascinating manners, and certainly not before his age in sanctity, or the assumption of it. He had rendered himself agreeable and useful to Rufus, with whom he was an es pecial favourite. He was dean here, and then dean of St. Paul's, and collector of the king's revenue ; and afterwards bishop of Durham. The Chroniclers of the time are pretty severe upon the vices both of him and his royal patron ; but perhaps we ought to discount a good deal, on account of dislike of the Normans, and envy at the success of Flam bard. Whatever we may think of his motive, Ave must ad mit that he was very clever. He had been long accused of"], [355, "271 THE NEW FOREST. one of the more deadly sins, and summoned by the pope or his legate, to appear and explain, or suffer for the same. He always pleaded excuses, but at last John de Crema, the legate, Avent to Durham, to rebuke the bishop in his own palace. Flambard prepared a most sumptuous entertain ment for the legate, and regaled him with the choicest wines and the most captivating conversation, until the papal func tionary was greatly elevated. Then he introduced to the company a niece of his own, a young lady of great beauty, and one whom he had trained to play her part. Beauty finished what wine had begun ; and the legate actually made an assignation with the niece of the man he had come to rebuke. The niece was true to her part ; she went to the chamber of the holy man at the appointed hour ; gained admission, and the door was bolted; but, in an instant, crash went the door, and in marched Flambard, with the whole posse of his chaplains bearing torches. There was no actual transgression in the case; but who was the ac cused now ? Flambard affected to look with Christian pity and forbearance on the frailty of a brother; the legate sneaked off; and the bishop heard no more about that spe cies of accusation. The life of Flambard was altogether a most eventful one ; but he at last died in peace, in his pa lace at Durham, having bequeathed a large portion of his property to the church. Notwithstanding the charges of immorality that have been made against Flambard, he appears to have been a splendid character ; and he had no sooner obtained the deanery of Tuinam, than he began to re-build the church and other erections at his own expense, just as Walkelyn had done at Winchester. He was also preparing to sub stitute monks for the secular canons ; but, getting into disgrace with Henry I, he was deprived of all his livings and property, and made a captive, It is doubtful whether he lived to complete the buildings which he had planned or in part executed ; and the parts which remain have cer tainly been erected at different dates ; but there is no"], [356, "272 THE NEW FOREST. question that a considerable portion is the original work of Flambard. After the time of Flambard, the priory appears to have had considerable acquisitions to its endowments, by grants from the De Redvers and others ; and early in the twelfth century, the secular canons were replaced by regulars of the Augustine order, and they continued, with variations of number, till the abolition. It may not be irrelevent to mention, as throwing a little light upon the feelings of the age, that the regulars were a sort of aristocratic exclusives in the church. The secular canons mingled with the people, anel were a part of them ; and would have preferred enjoying a potation with a living ploughman, to saying mass for the soul of a defunct peer ; and thus they had become unequal to the discharge of their proper functions, The principle upon which this function proceeded, was general, although many persons of the present day, would in their speech find fault with it. It was simply this : that a man coulel Avith perfect confidence, commit as much of Avhatever sin likeel him, as he chose, all the time he lived in this world, pro vided he could procure the necessary number of masses to be sure for his soul, after he was dead. This was a doctrine said to be popular ; and it is to this that the wealth which the church had in the middle ages, was mainly owing. It gave full licence to a man as long as he could have any en joyments, and the fragments which he left upon the table of sin, bought him a crown of peace and glory \u2014 made him a saint to the exact value of his bequest. The secular canons Avere apt to neglect these matters ; in short, though a man Avho had been wicked all his life, left the whole of his heri tage to the church at the end of it, he had no security that it Avould prove better with him than with the profane anel hardened Avicked who gave the church nothing ; anel to prevent this, the regular monks, who were debarred from having anything to do with the living Avorld, were invented. The success of the regulars in this way was their ruin in England ; for if the establishments had been as poor as they"], [357, "THE NEW FOREST. 273 Avere rich, they would have escaped the rapacity of Henry. A short extract from a letter to Henry, by the commis- sioners appointed to take the surrender of this priory, will show the intention and spirit of the whole. \" We found the Prior a very honest comfortable person, and the house well furnyshed with juellys and plate, whereof some be mete for the king's Majesty's use \u2014 as a letele chalys of golde; a goodly lardge crosse, doble gylt, with the foot garnyshed with stone and perle ; two goodly basons, doble gylt, having the king's armys well enamyled ; a goodly great pyxe, for the sacrament, double gylt. And there be also other things, of sylver, right honest and of goodvalew ; as well for the churche use as for the table, resyrved and kept to the King's use. In the church, we found a chaple and monument, curiously made of Cane (Caen) stone, pre- pared by the mother of Reynolel Pole, for herre bureall, Avhieh we caused to be defacyd, and all the armys and badgis clerely to be delete.\" Such is a short specimen of reformation by old Harry ; and one knows not which is more disgusting ; the gross cupidity, the Avanton devastation, or the shameful prostitution of language. According to these commissioners, a man was \" honest,\" exactly in the amount that they could play the thief upon him ; and stolen goods were \" honest \" in the ratio of their value ! And yet the monks were in a great measure to blame ; for if they had been half as zealous in the promotion of religion and knoAvledge, as they Avere in the accumulation of '* juellys and plate,\" no tyrant would have*, dared to plan, and no man would have been found to execute, so monstrous an injustice. The regular monks seem to have been particularly hostile to the diffusion of any kind of instruction among the people ; and the effect upon the monks themselves appears to have been a dull indolence, closely allied either to dementation or fatuity. Tradition says, that the common name by which the town's people designated the holy brethren, Avas the \" Abbey lubbers ; \" and as it is probable that the feeling inelicated by this epithet, was pretty general all over the VOL. II. NN"], [358, "274 THE NEW FOREST. country, Henry must have found the people more disposed to applaud than to hinder his spoliations. The regulars had great dislike to the mendicant friars, Avho went among the people, communicating such know ledge as it might be \u2014 and the kind was not a matter of first-rate importance, considering that the people had no mental resource or excitement, nothing to fall back upon in the hours of labour or occupation ; save the mere gratifi cation of their bodily appetites. There are evidences of this jealousy having actuated the canons of Christchurch ; for the carvings which are or were upon the stalls in the chapel, are all satires on the friars. One, figured as a fox, with a cock to say amen, preaches to a flock of geese ; another, in the form of a rat, is eating up the mess of pottage, upon AA'hich John Bull, in the character of a zany, has just turned his back; and, as in a variety of other devices, some often appear to be a little two-edged ; for in one place, there is a baboon of huge rotundity lolling upon a pilloAV, which, al though habited in the costume of a friar, has far more the appearance of a monk. These are of course in the chancel, where there are other ancient carvings ; among the rest is an altar-piece, with a genealogical tree, from \" the root of Jesse,\" the idea of which appears to have been copied by Hogarth, in his \" Marriage a la Mode.\" Near the altar are the mangled remains of the very beautiful chapel, which had been built by Margaret, the venerable countess of Salisbury, as a resting-place for her bones ; and which was so wantonly destroyed by Henry's itinerant plunderers. It is not difficult to understand the reason why Henry set his bandogs so mercilessly upon this beautiful and unoccupied tomb. The illustrious lady who had erected it was grand daughter to Warwick the king-maker, and daughter to Clarence, brother to Edward IV; and she was mother to Cardinal Pole and Lord Montague. But this, though it xplains, does not palliate, the atrocity of destroying this ieautiful monument. This was the lady Avho, when con iemned and brought to the block for high-treason, in the"], [359, "275 THE NEAV FOREST. seventieth year of her age, replied, when they asked her to lay her head on the fatal pilloAV : \" No, such is the custom of traitors ; but Margaret is no traitor. If my head must be taken off, it shall never be said that I stooped to have it done.\" Her two sons met with the same fate, and Avere no more guilty than herself. All the remains which are to be found in this sequestered spot would, however, require a volume for their simple enumeration, and we can afford little more than a page. The original plan appears to have been in the form of a cross, with a tower over the intersection ; but whether this was ever completed we cannot say. The architecture of the part that remains, has square pillars, with demi-columns sup- porting semicircular arches, enriched by zig-zag mouldings, \u2014 which style appears to have been introduced the next age after the tenth century ; and as the same style is found in most of the old Norman churches in Hants, it must be referred to the enel of the eleventh, or early part of the twelfth century \u2014 as the style began to be altered in character after the Crusades, which are said to have introduced a little of the Saracenic taste. The several parts of the ruin \u2014 for taken as a whole, it is nothing else, present many styles of architecture, and form altogether a rather heterogeneous assemblage ; which, however, is rather imposing in its general effect. The square tower at the west enel belongs to the fourteenth cen- tury, and was built by the Montacutes, then earls of Salis- bury ; as the arms of that family are on the shields at the sides of the eloorway. Over the doorway there is a large and handsome window, surmounted by a niche containing a figure of Christ, to whom the priory was dedicated after the introduction of the regular canons. The tower is 120 feet high, and contains a peal of eight bells, rather remarkable for the inscriptions upon them. These legends are in the church text, and in monkish rhyme with abbreviations ; but that on the fifth means something like this, \u2014 O bell of fame, Touzunes by name, Thy power can charm, us from all harm. NN 2"], [360, "276 THE NEW FOREST. The sixth is a little more impudent, or rather we should say impious. It is not so easily rendered; but it runs something as follows \u2014 the party abjurgated, meaning devils of all denominations : Tlie lamb first made, the fiend afraid ; Augustine next, the demon vexed \u2022 Now this great bell, sends him to hell. This is not literal, for the jargon cannot be rendered into any sort of language ; but this is the meaning ; and it will be\" perceived that there is a climax in it, and in this consists the impious blasphemy : \u2014 Saint Augustine is more efficient against the devil than the \" Lamb of God ; \" and the great bell at Christchurch is more efficient than both together ! The nave of the chapel is now used as the parish church ; but, from the marks of dilapidation upon it, it has not a pleasant appearance. There is an incongruity between these old chapels, which were intended only for procession and prayer, and a modern place of worship, in which people sit in pews to be instructed; and this incongruity is offensive, \u2014 a feeling which ought never to be excited by anything in a place set apart for the service of God. There has been an intention of forming an arched roof to the nave of this chapel, but it is doubtful whether this ever was completed. It has however been ceiled, and orna mented according to the taste ofthe times. The church has a vaulted ceiling, the ribs of which intersect each other in a very graceful manner ; and the bosses are ornamented by painted busts. The ascent to the high altar is by four steps ; and in the uppermost there is a large stone inscribed with the name of \" Baldwin\" son of William, earl of Devon. He died on the 1st of September, 1216; but the date is not mentioned on the stone. Below this there is a crypt, where masses appear to have been said for the souls of the illus trious dead. St Mary's, or the Lady chapel, forms the eastern portion of the assemblage. This was built about the end of the four teenth and beginning of the fifteenth centuries. It is in the"], [361, "277 THE NEAV FOREST. loft over this chapel that the free-school is taught ; and the old ambulatory of the monks is the the play-ground for the scholars. With the exception of the cloister, the whole of the precinct of this foundation is now private property, anel not many parts of the buildings remain. Vestiges of the fish-ponds, gardens, and other means of providing the larder, may be traced by those who are cunning in such matters ; and some time ago a very curious deposite was found under a stone in the floor of an inner apartment of the refectory. This was about half-a-bushel of the tarsi and toes of birds \u2014 chiefly poultry ; and herons, bitterns, and other echassiers, which were held in high respect by the gourmands of former times. There was, at the time, a good deal of anti quarian conjecture as to the cause of this curious interment \u2014 some supposing that there may have been a Roman temple on the site, for the worship of Mars, or Apollo, or some other deity, to Avhieh the cock was sacred; but the legs of herons and bitterns are rather against the hypothesis, as they have not much to elo with Mars, and they have still less to do with Apollo. Why the feet were hidden there it is not very easy to say ; but there can be no doubt as to what be came of the bodies of the birds. Nearly two miles to the eastward of the priory, and on the right-hand of the road to Lymington, is Somerford grange, once the farm-house to the establishment. This house, with the manor, Avas given to John Draper, the prior \u2014 most likely because Henry's commissioners found him to be \" a very honest comfortable person.\" The house is not a very ancient one, having evidently been con structed long after the dissolution. To the east of it there is appended a chapel, Avhieh, as it bears the initials of John Draper, was probably built by him for devotional purposes, after the demolition of the priory. At this place, there are indications of fish-ponds and fatting-stews, matters which were of great use to the brethren when they were compelled to fast upon fish ; in which case they were careful that the fish themselves should not have got the better of them by fasting first."], [362, "278 THE NEW FOREST. There appears to have been, at some time or other, a good deal of fighting in this part of the country ; for besides the entrenchments on Hengistbury or Christchurch head, to which we have already alluded, there is a camp on St. Catherine's hill, about a mile north of the town ; and in other places there are vestiges of entrenchments. We omitted to notice, in the proper place, a very curious legend connected with the building of the priory chapel, and which is alleged, by the monkish authorities, as the reason why the patronage of the renovated structure was confined to one person of the Trinity. While they were busied in building the church there was a strange workman, who was always diligent when they were at labour, but who never appeared at refreshment ; and, in consequence of his presence of course, not an accident occurred during the work. When it was nearly completed, an important beam, for which they had no substitute, was found too short ; and the men, not knowing what to do, retired to their habita- tions, to puzzle themselves for the night. Whether any of them hit upon a remedy did not need to be ascertained ; for when they went to see the work in the morning, the beam was in its place, and not only of the requisite length, but a foot more ; \u2014 so that there could be no doubt as to who had finished the work, and consequently deserved the patronage of an edifice, at the building of which he had laboured so diligently. There are persons at the present day who can point out the very beam, and it may be, who believe the legend ; but we understand that doubts exist as to whether the supernatural elongation took place at the but or the crop end of the tree. That, however, is a matter of minor importance, as it would be equally a miracle both ways. That such legends as this, which are equally abusive of the common sense of men, and calculated to injure, in as far as can be injured by human impudence, the majesty of heaven, in the estimation of rational beings, gives a very mournful picture of the state of the monastic mind. To say that He, by whom all worlds and all their inhabitants are created, should"], [363, "279 THE NEW FOREST. come down from heaven, and work as a common labourer at the building of a chapel in an obscure village, to say nothing of the miraculous lengthening of the beam, shows that the parties inventing the absurdity, could have hael no correct notions whatever of that Being in whose service they professed to drawl out their lives. LYMINGTON DIVISION. This portion of the New Forest district, occupies the central part of the south side, extending about ten miles along the coast and nine into the interior, reckoning from the point at Hurst castle, which is its extreme south, and about the mieldle of the sea coast. The western boundary commences at Chewton brook, in the bay of Christchurch, and about four miles to the eastward of that town ; and it extends northward and a little to the east for about eight miles, till it touches on the Boldre water, or Lymington river, in the Forest, and not many miles from its source. The northern boundary lies directly east and west, the western termination being rather more than two miles north-west of Beaulieu church ; and from this point the eastern bounelary extends southward, and meets the sea rather more than three miles to the eastward of the Ly mington river. This is rather an interesting section of the New Forest, both from its natural characters and from its history. A good deal of the upper part, towards the forest, consists of sandy heights covered with furze, and incapable of profitable cultivation ; but along the Lymington river, and also along the Avon which flows through the southern part of the section, much of the scenery is beautiful ; and the land is fertile, though no part of it can be considered as rich. The south-west coast presents towards the sea a succession of mud cliffs of considerable height, which are in a state of disintegration by the action of the weather and the tide ; and within Hurst castle, on the south-east, the shores are receiving continual aelditions by shingle, immediately north"], [364, "280 THE NEAV FOREST. of the castle ; and silt further to the eastAvard, which in process of time threatens to silt-up all the creeks, and render them unserviceable for navigation. This division is composed of three sub-divisions,\u2014 the upper half-hundred of Christchurch, in the south-west ; the parliamentary liberty of the borough of Lymington, in the the south-east ; and the upper half-hundred of the New Forest, in the north, but extending southAvard in a narrow tongue between the two former, to the sea coast on the left bank of the Avon. The upper half-hundred of Chrischurch is about five miles in its extreme dimensions both ways ; but its whole surface does not exceed a square of four miles in the side. The north part of it is rather high anel bleak, with not many inhabitants ; but the south, though by no means a rich country, is more thickly inhabited. The greater portion of it lies between the liberty of the borough of Christchurch, as already described, and the Avon Avater ; but toward the north, there is a portion on the north-east or left bank of that stream. It contains three parishes, the churches and villages of which are all situated at no great distance from the sea. These parishes are Milton, Hordle, and Milford, lying successively to the south-east of each other. Milton is about six miles to the Avestward of Lymington, on the right-hand side of the road to Christchurch. Though the living is only a curacy subordinate to the A'icarage of Milford, the parish is of considerable extent and value ; the population being 956, and the annual value, by the returns, 4875/. Though there are no manufactures, the population of this parish has increased nearly 200 since the preA7ious return, which indicates a thriving state of an agricultural parish ; and perhaps this may be in part attributed to the comparative suppression of smuggling, by Avhieh the inha- bitants of this part of the coast used to be sadly demoralised. The improved morals of the district have attracted several visitors to the coast in summer ; and those who wish to en joy the full sweets of the sea air, and the most extensive and"], [365, ""], [366, "JSIoir, i-J,\u201eV,\\ \", \" \" M ILF\u00a9IJS D S HUB CM.

Hordle is the next parish south-eastward of Milton. This parish is neither so large nor so populous as Milton, \u2014 the population being about 700, and the yearly valuation 1932/. The surface is, generally speaking, rather more elevated than that of, the former parish ; and Hordle cliff is among the tallest upon this part of the coast, and perhaps it suffers more than any other from the action of the weather. In proof of the ravages which the sea has committed here, it may be mentioned that Hordle possessed Salterns at the time of the Conquest ; and that the keen eye of a believing anti quary may still trace the remains of them, at or near the low water mark, at very low spring-tides. Hordle cliff forms a down of considerable beauty, though, from the cause just mentioned, it is gradually diminishing in extent. The summit of it is covered with fine short grass, and makes a delightful promenade. In particular, it commands a very fine view of the Needles, which, raising their jagged masses of chalk above the water, bear no inconsiderable likeness to shark's teeth on a gigantic scale. - When seen near, those lumps of chalk, and the chalky promontory of the Isle of Wight which forms the south side of Alum bay, have very little beauty ; but, seen from Hordle cliff, they are much im proved, especially in an evening light ; and, as fogs frequently form at this place, the refraction produced by these often causes the Needles and the cliffs to loom out in the most grotesque shapes. The cliff at Hordle is composed of various beds of clay, sand, and gravel ; and the clay, which is of a bluish tint, contains a number of shells. This peculiar stratum of clay runs northward into the Forest, anel, as far as it extends, there are shells in it. In some places it is covered with gravel, and sand, and marl, to the depth of about twenty feet, and in others it comes nearly to the surface. It seems a totally different formation from those matters which are superposed VOL II. OO"], [370, "282 THE NEW FOREST. upon it ; and would indicate that the tertiary formation has been a Avork of many ages, and not the result of any one grand catastrophe. This clay is the main cause of the dis integration of the cliff. Ihe land-springs get doAvn to it through the sand and gravel ; and as it absorbs the water, the frosts tear it in pieces. There is also another kind of action, which is of some use in explaining the land-slips that take place in some of the clayey and marly formations in this county. The action of the weather, forms a sort of crust upon the clay or marie which confines the water, up to a certain amount ; but then, when the rains come, and the springs pour in an additional quantity of water, the clay or marl is reduced to sludge, the hydrostatical pressure of which bursts the hardened crust toward the sea, and down goes the cliff in a mass of ruin. Milford is the richest and most populous parish in the half-hundred, \u2014 the yearly valuation being 6936/., and the population 1533 ; which is an increase of 200 since 1821. Through this parish, and partially also through that of Hordle, there runs a pleasant little stream, which rises in the Forest, near the Rising Sun public-house, and after a course of about seven miles, one of which is over the mud and flattened shingle banks at low water, falls into the Solent immediately to the northward of Hurst castle. The country on both sides of this little stream, but more especially on the north side, between it and the Avon, is very pleasant, consisting of enclosed grounds, interspersed with clumps of plantations and pleasant villages. The chief village, which contains a considerable number of houses, is close by the left bank of the stream, and the church about a furlong distant on the same side. This stream flows immediately behind the cliff at Hordle ; and approaches close to the bank of shingle, where it meets the high-water mark to the westward of Hurst castle. About half-a-mile north-east of this point, there are the tAvo pleasant villages of Key-haven and Vidley bar \u2014 close adjoining to each other; and with these the half hundred may be said to terminate."], [371, ""], [372, "FROM THE ISLE OF WIGHT.

At this place the shore is rather low ; and the most remark able feature of it is the shingle bank, at the extremity of which Hurst castle is situated. The whole length of this bank, from the land to the beach beyond the castle, is nearly two miles, \u2014 the first part of the length extending south-east warel for about a mile and a quarter, the remainder extend ing direct east for more than half-a-mile, and the point turn ing north-Avest for nearly the same distance. The whole of the southern or seaward side of this very curious point, is composed of shingle, which is drifted from the westward, and the sea is stormy and dangerous upon this side ; but upon the landward or north-east side, the point forms a safe and sheltered roadstead. The castle upon the point of this road was built by Henry VIII, it consists of a round-tower with semicircular bastions, and from its small elevation above the surface of the water, and the narrowness of the strait be tween it and the Isle of Wight, which is not much more than a mile across, it would, in case of necessity, completely com mand this entrance into the narrow seas. Such command Avas of importance at the time when the castle was construct ed ; but while England retains the command of the sea, these guard forts will be of little importance. Hurst castle has acquired some note in history, from being one of the places where Charles the First Avas kept in confinement. He was brought hither from Newport, on the first of September 1648, and remained here until the twenty-third day of the same month, when he was carried to Windsor under a strong escort. Charles is not the only prisoner who has been im mured in this castle, for Potil Atkinson, a Catholic priest, a native of Yorkshire, having been betrayed by a worthless maid servant, whom he rescued from misery and charitably maintained in his house, was doomed to imprisonment for life here, though guilty of no offence save worshipping his God according to the dictates of his conscience. Death re lieved him from this unjust and cruel imprisonment in 1729, and his body was interred at Winchester. No memorial of this persecuted priest remains in the castle ; but there is, or oo 2"], [374, "284 THE NEW FOREST. was, in the wretched apartments in which Charles was mewed up, a copy of what are called the Golden Rules of that talent ed, but misguided and unfortunate, monarch. No man who loves the weal of England can advocate the principles upon which Charles attempted to govern the country ; but the heart of a man is not in him who does not feel for the Royal Sufferer. The Borough of Lymington. Lymington is a very ele lightful little town. The greater part of it is upon an ele vated ground, which is remarkably dry and airy ; and the prin cipal street, which is spacious and well-built, and lies in the direction of east and west, has so much descent eastward to the river as keeps it very clean. When the tide is in, the river is a fine expanse of water, and contrasts beautifully with the land, the building, and the trees ; but when the tide is back the banks are sludgy and disagreeable. Small vessels can still come up to the quays at the lower part of the town ; but, it is understood, that the silting up of the es tuary has been greatly increased by a weir, which has been most injudiciously thrown across the river a little to the north. Lymington has a weekly market-day on Saturdays, and an nual fairs on May 12, and October 2, It sends two members to parliament ; and it may be regarded as both the port and the metropolis of that portion of the New Forest which abuts on the Solent. Besides this, the extreme healthiness of its situation, the beauty of the surrounding scenery, the delight ful drive from Redbridge through the forest, and the easy com munication with the Isle of Wight, either by sailing boats, or by the regular steam-boat across to Yarmouth, which is not above four miles from the town, or above half that dis tance in the main channel clear of the river, it is one of the sweetest spots in England for summer residence. For the accommodation of. the public, very commodious baths have been erected at a short distance below the harbour; and, taking it altogether, it is difficult to imagine a place where those who can afford it may enjoy more, both of the land and"], [375, "FROM MO/ 'A s PLEASANT. /Jy /'./\u25a0 .

The enclosed part of it is about fourteen miles long, anel this is on the average of about two miles wide, without bank or other interruption ; and then in fine weather, eight miles more may be obtained by doubling the Needles, and proceeding as far as Freshwater, in the Isle of Wight where fresh-water sailors will find a very pleasant rest and be thankful. As the district of country to which Lymington forms the port and capital, though extremely beautiful, is neither very large nor very populous ; the town can never become a place of very great trade, though its river is by no means badly adapted for navigation by small vessels. The population of the borough is 3361, which is an increase of 200, since the census in 1821 ; but since 1831, when the last census was published, it probably has increased a good deal more \u2014 as it is a spirited and bustling little place. There is no building of much importance in Lymington, for the parish church, which is only a chapelry in the parish of Boldre, situated farther up the river, is anything but handsome. This place once derived great importance from its salt works, which were the most valuable in the kingdom, and were understood at one time to yield a large sum to Govern ment in the tax upon culinary salt. Besides muriate of soda, the sulphates of soda and magnesia, which are used as aperients, under the names of Glauber's and Epsom salts, were made in considerable quantity at these works. As it comes more directly from the Atlantic, the water of the Channel is more impregnated with saline ingredients than that of the other coasts, especially the east coast of Britain ; and during the heat of summer, the water, being inclosed in shallow square tanks, was considerably concentrated by evaporation before it was carried to the pans to be boiled down. This boiling, at a place where coal had to be carried half-way round England, rendered the salt expensive ; and it has of course been driven out of the market by that obtained"], [380, "286 THE NEW FOREST. from the Midland counties, the procuring of which is much less expensive. The early history of Lymington is involved in consi- derable obscurity. There is no doubt that the Romans had a camp here, though whether it was one of habitual resort, or whether there was any town here in their time, are doubtful points. Where the Romans had a permanent station, whether port or otherwise, they always connected it with some adjoining place, by means of a road; and there is no trace of a Roman road leading from Lymington to any other part of the country. There are indeed the vestiges of a Roman camp, though not a very large one, about a mile north of Lymington ; these vestiges are on the right or west bank of the river, immediately opposite Vicar's hill on the eastern side. This camp is rectangular, with a double mound and ditch, about 200 yards in length from east to west, and rather less in breadth from north to south. Anti- quaries suppose that this camp was constructed by Vespasi- an, as a place of safety for his troops and galleys, during the intervals of those excursions which he made for the conquest of the Isle of Wight ; and they point out a sort of trench, leaeling from the river to the camp, in which they suppose the Roman galleys were draAvn up for safety. This of course is little better than conjecture ; but the form of the camp leaves little doubt of its being Roman ; there are also many barrows in the neighbourhood, which show that there has been a good deal of fighting here ; and Roman coins and urns have been found at or near the site of the present town. Some of the authorities will indeed have it, that Lymington was a town and port of some note before the Roman inva- sion, \u2014 that it was a sort of entrepot in the conveyance of tin from the mines of Cornwall to the Isle of Wight, from which isle it was taken, in exchange for other commodities, by the Ph\u0153nicians and other traders from the Mediterranean. But this story appears to be not merely improbable, but impossi ble. The Isle of Wight, especially the back of the isle toward the main Channel, is one of the very worst coasts in"], [381, "287 THE NEW FOREST. all England for the resort of shipping ; and to have carried tin eastward, through Lymington to the Isle of Wight, for the supply of ships wrhich must have passed the Cornish coast, both inward and outward, is very like \" carrying coals to Newcastle.\" We must therefore discard this notion of the antiquity and importance of Lymington, both as a town and a port ; though it may have been of more consequence in the time of the Saxons, and even in those of the Britons before them, than it was at the time of the Conquest ; for it is understood that this portion of the country, separated as it was from the rest of England by the woods and wilds in the central parts of the forest, must have suffered sadly from the destructive inroads of the Danes. In Doomsday Book the only mention made of Lymington (under the name of Lentune) is, that Earl Roger held a hide of land there, of which one half, consisting of woods, was taken into the fo rest ; the remainder, consisted of two plough-lands and four acres of meadow, with a villager, two serviles, and three bor derers, holding one plough-land together with the meadows. This does not say much for the value of the place in those days ; and it is not very probable that a town existed, otherwise it would have been named in the record. This Earl Roger, was Roger de Yvery, one of the chosen followers of the Conquerer, and the sworn friend of another Norman, Robert D'Oyley. These two_ had agreed to divide equally between them, whatever lands they might win by their swords, or by the favour of their royal master. The chivalrous spirit of Robert carried him further than this, however ; for, after the conflict was over, he succeeded in conquering the affections of a fair Saxon, of vast fortune, Alditha, daughter of Wigod, of Wallingford; and Robert shared her ample fortune with his friend Earl Roger. Earl Roger continued faithful to the Conqueror; but he took part against Rufus, in which he failed, and had his lands forfeited to the crown. This manor, with all the land westward to Christchurch, and eastward to Beaulieu, re mained under the royal possession until the reign of Henry I,"], [382, "288 THE NEW FOREST. who bestowed it, together with the lordship of the Isle of Wight, upon Richard de Redvers, of whom we have already taken notice, when mentioning Christchurch. It is under stood that, from the power of this baron, the convenience of its port, and the value of its salt-works, Lymington became a place of considerable importance as early as the twelfth century. The Redvers' family dilapidated their estates by donations to monasteries \u2014 which was the usual way of aton ing for sin in those days ; and they ultimately died out, in the end of the thirteenth century, in the person of an old lady, who, upon her death-bed, made over the whole to Ed ward III ; but he appears to have been satisfied with the lordship of the Isle of Wight, and to have returned the barony of Lymington to the heir at law, Courtnay, baron of Oakhampton. It was in the reign of this same Edward, that Lymington appears first to have been considered as a borough, and was summoned to send members to parliament ; but it did not avail itself of the privelege until the twenty-seventh of Elizabeth. The name of Dore is of some note in the domestic history of Lymington. During the times when these coasts were plun dered by the French, a party of these marauders landed ; and the leader, being very hungry, was resolved to feast before he began to plunder. The mansion of Madam Dore promised to have the best larder, and thither the gallant marauder wended to have his refection. The lady set before him the very best that her house afforded, and kept him company with such good humour that he thanked her, made his bow, and embarked without doing the smallest injury. Colonel Thomas Dore was one of those upon whom Monmouth mainly depended in his rebellion against James II ; but, as the colonel had only meditated, not actually joined the rebellion, he was pardoned. There is another instance of female strategy mentioned in this case. The conspirators, who were planning how the town might most efficiently second the designs of Monmouth, met at the house of Mrs. Knapton, were they assisted them-"], [383, "289 THE NEW FOREST. selves in their cogitations with pipes and ale. During one of their meetings they got intelligence that a party to appre hend them had entered the town. Upon this, Mrs. Knapton despatched them by the back windows, removed the pipes and drinking vessels, and, in order to cloak the real cause of the hugue of tobacco in the room, muffled up her jaws in flannel ; so that when the party entered, they found nothing but an old woman to all appearance grievously afflicted with the tooth ache, aud puffing at a tobacco pipe with all her might as means of relief. The politics of this borough, or at all events those of the Dores, appear to have changed greatly between the reign of Charles I and that of James II. In the former, they did all they could to assist Prince Charles in his attempts to rescue his father from his imprisonment in Carisbrook castle ; but in the latter, the colonel already alluded to, not only took part with Monmouth, but was very zealous in bringing about the revolution. Subsequently, Lymington had much the character of a property or nomination borough, the number of voters not having exceeded seventy, and the influence of the borough being in the possession of the Neale family. At present, the parliamentary boundaries extend over a conside rable, but very irregularly shaped, district on the sea-coast, It extends about four miles on the straight line, from the mid dle of the salt works westward to near Sowley on the east, and one point of it extends three miles up the east side of the Lymington water to Boldre ; but, on the west side of the river, it extends only about a mile and a half from the sea. The environs of the town are very beautiful, especially on the east or opposite side of the river, for the surface there is much diversified with swellings and dales, and it is well wooded. When however, a well-wooded district is mentioned in this part of Hampshire, it must not be considered as con taining such majestic trees as occur in the rich soils in the midland parts of England. In most places here, the trees are gnarly and-stunted, and never attain any very great height, VOL. II. PP"], [384, "290 THE NEW FOREST though their timber is probably more durable than that of trees of larger anel more rapid growth. The upper half-hundred of the New Forest, which forms the remainder of the Lymington division, contains only two parishes, those of Boldre and Brokenhurst ; and the unaf forested land contained in them lies in very irregular patches, spotted about among the woods and naked moors, \u2014 the wooels being mostly on the slopes, the naked moors on the heights, and meadow or marsh in the bottoms, though to this there are local exceptions, depending on the nature of the soil, which is very variable. Boldre is an extensive parish ; and it is also one of considerable value. The annual valuation was indeed higher than that of the borough of Lymington, being 7780/., and the population by the census in 1831, was 2111, which was less than it had been ten years previous. Some of the inhabitants of the outskirts of this parish are very poor persons who have obtained their huts by trespass on the forest ; and therefore the annual value is not so high, in proportion to the population, as it is in some of the parishes farther to the south. Boldre is the original parish church and village, and in Domesday Book it is named Bovreford, which means the place for the passage of cattle. The situ ation of the church is very beautiful ; though the building itself has little to recommend it, being a compound of different styles of architecture. The parsonage, situated on Vicar's hill southward of the church, is also very finely exposed ; and not very long ago, the parish had the happiness of pos sessing a vicar, who was equally an honor to his sacred calling anel to human nature, this was the Reverend William Gilpin, so well known for his exquisite taste in the feeling and delineation of natural beauties, more especially those of forest scenery.

Wm. Gilpin, A. M.\" is not more true to the character of the man than aught which Thorwaldsen himself could chisel. It is a high honour for Hampshire to have possessed such a man ; and the only one whom we can bring into any sort of comparison with him is the gentle historian of Selborne, the Reverend Gilbert White. Both were men not to be repeated in a century ; but they had their different walks, \u2014 White delineated the substance of nature with admirable simplicity and truth ; but Gilpin conjured up the spirit, and gave that, which all feel by touches, but which few can appreciate, \" a local habitation and a name ;\" so that, if one but opens his enchanted and enchanting book in the veriest wild of nature, that wild forthwith becomes an Eden in primeval bloom. Gilpin established, at Boldre, schools for the education of twenty boys and an equal number of girls ; and he devoted to the endowment of those schools the whole of his drawings anel sketches ; which, when sold in London, netted more money than had been anticipated. He was in fact a model of men and of vicars ; and one knows not whether most to admire his natural or his professional character. Brockenhurst, the next parish north of Boldre, and the only other one in this division of the county, is a place of considerable antiquity, and very beautifully situated. The name literally means, the \" hurst,\" \" hirst.\" or height of the yew-trees, \"Brocken\" being the genitive of the name of a yew-tree in the Anglo-Saxon language ; and \" hurst \" has, of course, its ordinary signification, \u2014 that of a dry elevation. This is literally the character of the place. It stands upon an elevation, from which a pleasant view of a considerable part of the forest, which is very beautiful as seen from the heights here, is obtained. Though Brockenhurst is more immediately Avithin the limits of the New Forest than any other place, excepting Lyndhurst, it does not appear to have been afforested by pp 2"], [388, "292 THE NEW FOREST. William, or even by those of his successors, who certainly extended the forest much farther than he had done. The church must have existed before the Conquest, as it is men tioned in the Domesday Survey ; and if the building is not Saxon, it is at least of the earliest Norman. The land is in some places a strong clay loam ; and the trees upon it are of larger size than in most of the adjoining parts. Of these, an oak and a yew in the church-yard are among the most mag nificent, though the latter has been lopped of some of its branches. The parish contains more than 800 inhabitants, and the yearly valuation was 3119/. The Boldre or Lyming ton river passes by the north end of the village. In winter it is a considerable stream ; but in the dry season it contains little water ; and what it does contain is very deeply tinged with oxide of iron and peat. The village is straggling, but very rural ; and the situation of the park and manor-house is fine. DIBDEN LIBERTY. This occupies the eastern part of the New Forest district ; and its form resembles that of a triangle, having its two sea ward sides about eight miles in length each, and its landward side about nine miles. Some parts of the interior are very bare, being upon the worst portion of the crag sand ; but the coasts are very beautiful \u2014 more so perhaps than those of any other part of the district. In this liberty there are the four parishes of Dibden, Fawley, Exberry, and Beaulieu. Dibden, which was an ciently written Depedene \u2014 which means a dell of thick wood, was a place of some note at the time of the Conquest ; but three-fifths of its extent Avere taken into the forest, al though it is probable that they were the uninhabited parts. This part of the district is exceedingly beautiful ; and it is remarkably accessible, for Hythe, the ferry across to South ampton, is near the middle of the most beautiful portion ; and when the Southampton Railway is completed, it will be no great effort of abstinence, for a man to sleep in London,"], [389, ""], [390, "i' Miulujter, Published foi ih, Proprieties, Ja/RobbinJ, College Street"], [391, ""], [392, "\u00a3\u00a3AULJ\u00a3U CHIUIBCM, WSW FOREST FAWfLBY CIJJJHO;. ihsirhf.ltl. -"], [393, "293 THE NEW FOREST. and breakfast here. The value of the parish was returned at 2366/., and the population is upwards of 500. The church is an ancient structure, but has little to recommend it, save the remains of a most venerable yew-tree in the church-yard. A considerable portion of mud-bank has been enclosed and recovered at Dibden ; and it were well if the example were followed in other parts on this side the Southampton Water. This is the sheltered side ; and the land along the shore is richer and the scenery more beautiful than on the opposite side, where the foliage of the trees is much injured by the sea air. The freehold land here consists principally of grants from the crown ; and some of the tenures are a little whimsical. That of Burr farm, a few miles north of the village of Dibden, is held upon the obligation of presenting two white greyhounds to the king, when he enters the New Forest ; and we believe the lord of the manor preserves a white breed, in case of emergency, though they have not been exacted of him since 1789, when a pair were presented to George III. Fawley, which occupies the south-eastern angle of the district, is a more populous parish than Dibden, though less valuable according to the returns. Its population is 1839, and the annual value only 1539/. Calshot castle is in this parish; and it is one of the memorials of Henry VIII, who is said to have set the example to Cromwell, of building forts out of the ruins of abbeys. This was, of course, quite in character ; for, as Henry had declared himself head of the church in his legal capacity, which is, of course, always more or less, a military one, forts and guns were far more appropriate insignia of his sacerdotal authority than monks and bells. Cadland park, situated a little to the north of the parish church and village of Fawley, is one of the most beautiful residences in the New Forest ; whether we con sider its own grounds, or the land and water by which it is surrounded. The house is on a gentle eminence, surrounded by a judicious admixture of lawn and wood ; and it takes in a large extent both of sea and land ; as if they were its"], [394, "294 THE NEW FOREST. appendages. The three forks of the sea, toward Southamp ton, toward Spithead, and toward the Needles, are all visi ble ; two of them are land-locked, and a very little imagina tion will give that character to the other, and they then appear as one gigantic lake. The village of Fawley is one of the largest in the New Forest. There are many very fine trees in this part of the country ; and the bottoms upon the small streams within the forest are favourite grazing ground for deer. Exberry, to which Leap is attached, lies on the left bank of the Beaulieu river ; and the surface around is very beau tifully wooded. These woods are chiefly of oak of natural growth, though they are private property. The population of this parish is 325, and the valued rental 1906/. There is some reason to believe that the church of Exberry is the oldest upon the river ; because the original name of the river is the Ex, though the importance of the abbey during the middle ages occasioned it to be called the Beaulieu river. Beaulieu is the last parish in this part of the district. Like the last-mentioned one it is very finely wooded, espe cially in the vicinity of the river ; and, in some places, the woods melt off very finely into the open moors of the New Forest. The population of this parish is 1298, and the yearly valuation 5299/. While the abbey existed it held the tithes of the parish, and the consequence is that it is now only a curacy. Beaulieu abbey is situated, that is, was situated, to the north-east of the village, on the left or opposite bank of the river, across which there is here a bridge. Small vessels can come up to the bridge ; and many spots on the beauti ful reaches below are well adapted for ship building. Of the abbey few remains are left, nor are those which do exist of much interest. This abbey was founded and endowed by King John, in the year 1204 ; and there is a ridiculous legend of his being induced to this holy act, in consequence of a dream, that the Cistercian abbots were flogging his royal body, in presence and by order of a judge. According"], [395, "295 THE NEW FOREST. to the legend, John had summoned the Cistercian abbots to Lincoln, where he ordered his retinue to trample them to death under the feet of their horses ; but, the attendants refusing, the abbots scampered off; the following night John dreamed as beforesaid, and the result was, especial favour bestowed on the Cistercians, including the establishment of Beaulieu abbey among the rest. John endowed it very richly, and granted a sum of money toAvard the building of it ; but it was so splendid that 4000 marks remained unli quidated, for which a grant was made of the impropriation of Cokewell in Berks. Henry III confirmed all the grants, and added free warren, and the privilege of markets within the manor of Farendon ; and Edward III added a tun of wine annually for the celebration of mass. Pope Innocent invested the abbey precincts with the privilege of sanctuary, and exempted it from tithes and imposts. All these privileges remained till the dissolution by Henry VIII, who confer red the manor upon the earl of Southampton. This abbey was twice used as a sanctuary in cases of some importance, during the time that it retained its privilege. One of these was by Margaret of Anjou, queen of Henry III, when, on returning from the continent, she found that the army was destroyed, the earl of Warwick killed, her husband a pri soner, and Edward IV on the throne. Margaret received this disastrous intelligence upon her landing at Weymouth ; the shock subdued even her bold spirit ; she fled to the sanctuary with her young son, where, however, her courage and some of her friends again rallied. The other case was that of Perkin Warbeck, who fled hither when worsted before Exeter. The sanctuary was however invested by Lord Daubeney, with 300 men. The promises of Henry VII drew Warbeck from his place of safety; and in a manner, the right and wrong of which would not be easily settled, he was committed to the Tower, and afterwards was executed at Tyburn, in 1449. It is understood that the sanctuary extended to the whole precinct of the abbey, but not to the manor which is more"], [396, "296 THE NEW FOREST. than twenty-five miles in circuit. That of the precinct has been about a mile and a half, and some portions of the wall, in which there appears to have been only one gate, still remain. The abbot's lodging, the dormitory, and the kitchen, can still be traced ; and the present parish church of Beaulieu is understood to have been the refectory. This is a strong but plain building, with a curious oak roof, having the intersections of the beams ornamented with various rude sculptures. There is no ancient monument within this church, as it was not a place of worship till after the suppression, at which time, or soon afterwards, the abbey church appears to have been completely dismantled, and now there is not a vestige of it left. Against the west wall of the church, there is a demi-octagonal rostrum or pulpit, from which the reader used to edify the monks during the time they were at their meals. The following quotation will ex plain in what manner this was done. \" Let the reader of the refectory, after prayers, carry the proper books into that apartment. Let him stand before his book with his face turned toward the east. When the brethren bow at the Gloria Patri and the Lord's Prayer, let the reader also in cline himself, turning his face toward the assembly. The reader should not seat himself till the head of the convent is seated. Let him read historical books with a sonorous voice, but sermons and homilies with a more gentle and en gaging one.\" We add also a little more to show how the brethren were to demean themselves : \u2014 \" When we enter the refectory, let us uncover our heads; and approaching our seats, let us incline our bodies to the cross. So also in the refectory, we should not behave idly, but demean our selves with propriety, lest we be an offence to any of our brethren. It behoves us, likewise, to keep our eyes fixed when we are in this apartment, lest any occasion of mur muring, quarrelling, or laughing, be given; according to the saying of the blessed Hugh of Lincoln : \u2014 ' Let us have our hands and eyes upon the table, our ears with the reader, and our hearts with God.'"], [397, "297 THE NEAV FOREST. When we drink let us hold the cup with both our hands. It is improper for us to cleanse our mouths, or our hands, with the napkin, in the refectory. We should not put our platters from us, till the president has put away his; nor let us roll up our napkins, until the prior, or abbot, has rolled up his.\" This extract, which is literally translated from the original, shows what kind of discipline was carried on in those mo nastic establishments, which once possessed so large a share both of property and of power in England. No system could be better calculated for destroying all the energies of the human character, and rendering the monk the mere slave of his superiors; and this seems to have been the grandest object of these establishments. Still, the monks at Beaulieu appear to have had sufficient regard to the good things of this world. From the few fragments that yet exist, we must conclude that their build ings had been very splendid ; and there are remains of fish ponds and stews, as well as of canals and pipes for the supply of purer water than that of the river. It is probable also that the monks manufactured their own wine from grapes grown on ground a little to the northward of the abbey, which ground is still called \" the vineyards ;\" this term is applied to fields adjoining other places in the south of England where there have been religious houses, as at Winchester for instance ; and they are generally southward sloping banks, which would answer well for vine culture. It has sometimes been said that superstition is prone to linger about the ruins of abbeys; and we may mention a single instance in the case of this one, \u2014 that of Mary Dore, the witch of Beaulieu. Like the rest of her craft, this delegate of the dark power, was an old woman in humble life ; and she was never known to be mischievous, or to cast her spells upon any one ; but she had no inconsiderable control over her own form and dimensions. Being some what addicted to the pilfering of sticks in the adjoining woods, she would, instantly upon being discovered, trans- VOL. II.

Among those who believed in, and even respected, this self-changing female, John, second duke of Montague, to whom the manor belonged, and who was most zealous in clearing the rubbish from the few remains of the abbey, is said to have been inclueled. At all events, he erecteel a tomb to her memory ; but that has now perished, and it does not appear that the enchantress has had any successor. Beaulieu has noAV little attraction, save for the exquisite beauty of the scenery along the river, which, though it has not a single element of grandeur, is not, of its kind, ex celled by any in England. It is however, simply, a beauti ful place, and the confined district in which it lies will prevent it from ever acquiring any general importance. The principal grange belonging to Beaulieu abbey was at St. Leonard's, about two miles and a half to the south ; and vKtt quite a mile south-west of this was another grange \u2014 Park farm. These granges had chapels attached to them, in which certain parts of the service were occasionally per formed. There are some remains of these chapels which show that they were neatly constructed ; but the fragments of them have been devoted to the most common farming purposes. The barn at St. Leonard's shows upon how magnificent a scale these monks carried on their farming operations. It has been more than 225 feet long, 77 wide, and upwards of 60 in height. \u2014 Such are a few remini scences of the once stately abbey of Beaulieu, which appears to have been one of the richest in this part of England; but, of the sayings or the doings of its monastic inhabitants, we believe there is no memorial. Rather more than a mile to the westward of Park farm, the village of Sowley is situated, where there is a pretty large sheet of water, known by the name of Sowley pond. This served to turn the machinery at the Sowley forges, Avhere iron of very superior quality was made, and which"], [399, "299 THE NEW FOREST. Was formerly of great importance, though that, of course, has diminished in latter times. This used formerly to be called Freshwater, and it formed the boundary of the abbey lands in this direction. It is in part retained by an en bankment; and in some places it is very deep. About a mile and a half to the westward of SoAvley, at Baeldesley, there was a preceptory of Knights Templar. Many years ago, when people were a little more prone to superstition than they are now, \" the groaning tree of Baddesley,\" was a subject of much conversation and some alarm in this part of the country. It was first heard by the wife of a cot tager, who Avas greatly alarmed ; but others soon heard it also ; the groans were ascertained to proceeel from an elm, an apparently healthy tree, which greAV at the bottom of a garden, and which soon attracteel the inhabitants of the neigh bourhood, rapidly extended in celebrity, was a subject of visitation, and had a guide book, describing the tone and manner of its lamentations. How long it might have con tinued to be thus attractive there are no data for determi ning. It did mourn away for about a year and a half, and attracted royal visitors among others; but the proprietor, by way of making one experiment for finding the cause, bored a hole in the trunk, upon which the tree became silent ; as a second experiment he had it grubbed up ; but this left him just as much in the dark as ever, and prevented any one else from assisting him in solving the mystery. There is no doubt that many of the noises that are heard in woods, in houses, and sometimes in holloAv and cavernous places of the earth, which alarm the timorous in all ages, and which were attributed to certain divinities by the' ancients, and to spirits pegged up by enchanters \u2014 as Pros pero found his Ariel, in the more fanciful superstitions ; \u2014 there is no doubt that these sounds are, in many instances, produced by musical instruments of Nature's making, and of which we are perfectly ignorant. Let but the wind howl through a leafless clump in the winter, and there are not only as many elistinct tones as twigs, but very generally QQ 2"], [400, "300 THE NEW FOREST. some one bole or branch, for no reason one can discover, gives \" one groan more \" after the fury of the blast has dashed by. We know but little of the power and compass of so mighty an instrument as the earth ; and we know as little of the kind and degree of action that can bring out its sound, in every particular case. We do know that when one of the small beetles, or their larv\u00e6, which subsist in the interior of timber, gnaws asunder a certain portion of the growth, a crack, as loud as the report of a small pistol, is sometimes given, although the primary cause of the con cussion is a mere nothing. The parting of a tack of glue will produce a similar sound ; and if the wood of a tree contains internal shades, even though these are subse quently covered by entire rings of wood, such a tree will scarcely ever keep quiet, if there is the lightest air stirring, \u2014 and there are many states of the weather in which the moving air will lay hold of the top of a tree when not a breath is felt by one standing by the root. That the groan ing of the Baddesley tree was produced by a cause of this description there seems no reason to doubt, for all agreed that there was no imposture in it ; but what the specific mode of action was, cannot of course be known, any more than one can account for some of the noises that procure houses the name of being haunted. A good many years ago a church in the north groaned most dismally for two Sun days, and upon examination it was found that a slate had slipped doAvn and imprisoned a pigeon, which was thus calling for deliverance, and which had kept itself alive by eating great part of the materials of a nest. Estimated along the windings, the unafforested lands penetrate into the interior to between six and seven miles along the Boldre or Lymington water, and between five and six along the Ex or Beaulieu river. Between the rivers, the projection of the forest approaches within one mile of the sea, near Sowley pond; and on the east of the Beaulieu river, it approaches within a mile and a half. The bounda ries are, however so irregular, that no idea can be formed of them, except by means of a large plan."], [401, "301 THE NEW FOREST. NORTHERN PURLIEUS. From Dibden, the quantity of unafforested land, between the forest property so calleel, and what we have described as the natural boundaries of the district, is much smaller than on the other side. At Dibden, the forest boundary is between two and three miles from the Southampton Water, and it extends thence north-west, for about six miles, to Cadnam bridge, from whence westward it is conterminous with the county all the way to DoAvnton common, within a short distance of the Avon, with the exception of a few patches at Bramshaw. The only parishes here, are Eling and Bramshaw, and the greater part of the latter is in the county of Wilts. Eling is a wealthy and populous parish, the annual value being returned at 13,161/., and the popu lation at 4632. The appearance of Eling village is quite that of a little town; and the ships in the creek, in the middle of a grove of tall trees, have a very singular appear ance, \u2014 the more so, that no part of the creek in Avhieh they lie can be seen till one comes close upon it. The adjoining villages of Totton and Rumbridge also contain a considera ble population ; and there are a good many straggling houses along the road to Lyndhurst. The lower portion of this part is in general rich soil, with a subsoil of strong clay ; but, toward the New Forest, its character changes, and it may be said to crop out upon a dreary heath. In general it is well wooded, and from the abundance of timber in the surrounding country, it is admirably situated for the building of small vessels. More attention has been paid to the planting of timber in Eling, and some of the neigh bouring parishes, than in almost any other part of Hamp shire, or indeed than in the royal forests themselves. Bramshaw can scarcely be described as a Hampshire parish, as there is only a small stripe along the west side of it contained in the county ; but the church and a good many of the cottages along the road, are within the boun dary. The living is in the diocese of Salisbury, and the"], [402, "302 THE NEW FOREST. patronage belongs to the Dean and Chapter there. The an nual value was returned at 2347/., and the population is about 800. MANORS AND OTHER HOLDINGS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE FOREST. These are so spotted about, and so irregular in their forms, that we can attempt little more than a rude indi cation of their positions, with regard to each other, and to the Forest. The principal ones are the manors of Lynd hurst and Minstead, lying contigious to each other \u2014 and Minstead, which is situated north-west of Lyndhurst, ap proaches within a mile of the northern boundary of the Forest at Wittenford bridge, on the confines of Wilts. This manor is an irregular oval, about three miles in length, and a mile and half in breadth. It contains the church of Minstead, a parish which was valued at 2145/., and has a population of 1074. The living is a rectory, and the patronage in private hands. The church stanels about three miles north-north-west of the town of Lyndhurst ; and it is within this parish, though not on the manor but in the Forest, that the spot is pointed out where William Rufus fell by the arrow of Tyrrel. This spot is about a mile north west of the church of Minstead, and rather more than a furlong to the right of the road from Romsey to Ringwood, at a mile or a little more on the Ringwood side of Cadnam bridge. The legend connected with this spot will be men tioned afterwards. Lyndhurst manor is of smaller extent and less regular form than Minstead ; and it occupies very nearly the centre of the Forest. The figure which it most nearly approximates is an equilateral triangle, of a mile and three-quarters in the side ; and perhaps the area does not differ greatly from that of such a triangle, only the sides are very irregular. The directions of these sides are north-east, south-east, and west. A considerable portion of the manor, especially of the west"], [403, ""], [404, ".' W / ///.

These mansions, or villas, are pleasantly situated ; and the surfaces of their grounds are varied, and well broken by lawn and wood. It appears from Doomsday Book, that three hides of this manor \u2014 which hides were probably in great part covered with wood, were taken into the Forest. The remainder continued to be held by the descenelants of the same Saxon who had held it in the days of Edward the Confessor. At the same time Lyndhurst was a royal manor valued at two hides, of which one hide and three-quarters were taken into the Fo rest, and the remaining yardland, or quarter of a hide, was held by the royal forester. Lyndhurst is the metropolis of the Forest, and has been so from the time of its first afforestation. In former times it was, of course, of much more importance than it is now, \u2014 as all the ancient sanguinary laws of the forest, have ceased since the Revolution of 1688. As it is in what may be regarded as the principal thoroughfare of the Forest \u2014 that Avhieh leads from the north to Lymington, it has some way faring trade, especially in the summer months ; but while the environs continue forest, with very few inhabitants, it never can become a place of much importance. The annual value was returned at 3285/., and the population in 1831 was 1236, which was an increase of about 66 eluring the previous ten years, The principal street of the village, lies in the direction of east and west, from the Redbridge road to the King's house, which last is situated near the church, on the height of the ridge. Another street branches north from this along the Romsey and Salisbury roads, which con tinue the same till one arrives at Cadnam, on the borders of the Forest. Two other roads lead southward, and meet at the south part of the grounds at the King's house, whence the single line of road proceeds onward, by Brockenhurst to Lymington. There are very many other roads which ramify"], [406, "304 THE NEW FOREST. from Lyndhurst in different directions; but as they are Forest roads only, they can be noticed with more advantage when we come to take a glance at the Forest itself, without reference to towns, or any species of human structures. Lyndhurst is a pretty village, certainly ; but the greater part of the vicinity is poor, and it looks a place out of the world ; the church is in a commaneling situation, but it has not much claim to attention in respect of its architecture. The King's house is but a homely structure, though it is occupied by the Lord Warden when he visits the forest, and occa sionally, though of late years rarely, received a passing call from Majesty. The only curiosity about it, if curiosity it can be called, is the hall of Rufus, a very plain apartment, and certainly not of the same antiquity as the days of that monarch. In this hall are shown, an ancient stirrup, which is said to have belonged to Rufus, together with a table and chair, of very strong but very clumsy workmanship, to which similar antiquity is assigned. Other than this, there is little to be seen at Lyndhurst, save the Forest views which surround it; but, notwithstanding this, if one wishes tho roughly to examine the Forest, Lyndhurst is unquestionably the head-quarters to be chosen ; and from it, each day sur veying a section, and the perambulating of these sections, will furnish a very complete knowledge of the Forest. The remaining manors and holdings included within the perambulation of the Forest, are small as compared with those now stated. The chief of them are as follows : Burley manor, within less than a mile of the south-west corner of the Forest ; Wootten enclosures, on the south bor der, nearly three miles south-east of Burley ; Henshersley farm, a small patch to the westward of Brockenhurst ; and the bishop of Winchester's purlieu, about two miles north west of Beaulieu ; Culverley farm, a little to the eastward of that of Ipsley farm, on the border of the Forest near Dibden ; Bartley, a little south-west of Cadnam ; Fritham, another little patch to the north-west of Minstead; and there are also some little pieces along the extreme west of the Forest ; but"], [407, "BID KOMC'S MOUSE, LVKIDMI! n, \u201e, /\u201e,!,, nil,/. .,,,, / /,., ii,. i:. ,\u201e,,/,, /\u201e'/:\u201e/./\u201e\u201e, til/,,/, .to,,, l:, HI i:,l\u201e\u201e,\u201e.n,l,l\u201eJ.;i.\u201e\u201e,Jl\u201e,l, Sine."], [408, ""], [409, "THE NEW FOREST. 305 the principal part of them are commons, rather than culti- vated grounds. But, besides what we have enumerated, there are many hovels, with minute patches of ground, which have been taken possession of owing to the indifference of the keepers, and are now held by prescription. These encroachers are, generally speaking, persons of very questionable character, who live most wretched and abandoned lives, and procure much of their miserable subsistence by plunder ; while they are ready to enter with eagerness upon any smuggling or plun- dering expedition to which there may be the slightest temp- tation. In former times, we believe that this description of population was much more abundant than itis now. One cause of this is the check that has been given to smuggling ; another is perhaps the greater vigilance of the keepers ; and, we wish we could confidently add that a third cause is the encreased morality of the humbler classes of the population. We sincerely wish, and in part believe this ; but it is a point upon which it is difficult to come to a firmly estab- lished opinion. According to former reports, persons, not in a state of absolutely pecuniary destitution, were in the habit of stealing localities in the forest, which they did by means of hovels, the parts of which were prepared in other places, and brought to the forest and erected in the course of a single night. When once the hovel was erected, and a fire kindled, the keepers could not eject the tenant without the formality of a legal process ; and both his ease and his safety were against his having recourse to that. It was a trouble for which he realised no particular advantage ; and, as the persons who trespassed upon the forest in this illegal manner, were as ready to become murderers as thieves, he was not safe if he interfered with them. This was a wretched state of things, certainly, but that it was the state of things is but too well known. It seems a general law of human nature, that if man either remains in the wild forest, or re turns to it, there is no alternative to his being or becoming a ferocious savage. We quote an anecdote from the faithful VOL II. RR"], [410, "306 THE NEW FOREST. and graphic pen of Gilpin, in which the character of an abode and family of these forest outcasts is depicted with a force which no mere writer could impart to a fiction. Gil pin and a friend had been taking an evening ramble, not in the royal Forest, but in the delightful woods at Exbury, the seat of Colonel Mitford. \"Among these unknown woods,\" says he, \"our way became at length perplexed, and the sun was now set. Having no time, therefore, to lose, we enquired at a lonely cottage which we found in a shel tered glade. Nothing could indicate peace and happiness more than this little sequestered spot, and we expected to find a neat, peaceful, contented family within. But we found that a happy scene will not always make happy in habitants. At the door stood two or three squalid children, with eager famished countenances staring through matted hair. On entering the hovel, it was so dark, that we could at first see nothing. By degrees a scene of misery opened. We saw other ragged children within, and were soon struck with a female figure, grovelling, at full length, by the side of a few embers upon the hearth. Her arms were naked to her shoulders, and her rags scarce covered her body. On our speaking to her, she uttered, in return, a mixture of obscenity and imprecations. We had never seen so deplo rable a maniac. We had not observed, when we entered, what now struck us, a man sitting in the corner of the hovel, with his arms folded, and a look of dejection as if lost in despair. We asked him who that wretched person was. ' She is my wife,' said he, with a composed melan choly ; ' and the mother of these children.' He seemed to be a man of great sensibility, and it struck us what distress he must feel every evening after his labour, when, instead of finding a little domestic comfort, he met the misery and horror of such a house \u2014 the total neglect of his little affairs \u2014 his family without any overseer, brought up in idleness and dirt \u2014 and his wife, for whom he had no means of providing either assistance or care, lying so wretched an object always before him. We left him strongly impressed"], [411, "307 THE NEW FOREST. with his calamity, which appeared to be a more severe visitation than the hand of heaven commonly inflicts. We found afterwards that we had been wholly mistaken, and that, we had before us a strong instance of that strange fatality by which mankind are so often themselves the ministers of those distresses which they are so ready to ascribe to heaven. On relating our adventure at supper, we were informed, that the man, whose appearance of sensi bility had affected us so much, was one of the most hardened, abandoned, mischievous fellows in the country \u2014 that he had been detected in sheep-stealing \u2014 and that he hael killed a neighbour's horse in revenge \u2014 and that it was supposed that he had given his wife, who was infamous likewise, a blow in a quarrel, which had occasioned her malady.\" The several kinds of holdings of the lands within the perambulation, but not included in the Forest, have some peculiarities. For the king's venison have, by the original grants, free range of them ; and the game on them is also the property of the sovereign. The timber is however the property of the freeholder ; and the government rights are not now enforced in the case either of venison or game. In the manor of Beaulieu there is one peculiarity, the people there, or at all events the lord of the manor, being entitled to kill stray deer upon the manor, but not to follow it back into the Forest. This may have been a pleasant enough privilege for the abbot and his monks, whose servants had little else to do than purvey for their masters ; but now it is rather a mischievous one, as the people often lose a great deal of their time in looking out for, or trying to kill or capture, stray deer. Deer in a wild forest are the game of barba rous ages ; and it does not appear that the industrious people of a civilised age can have the slightest connection with them, without waste of time, deterioration of morals, or both. The copyholds under the crown are subject to quit-rents and fines, which are in general moderate ; and matters re specting them are decided in the manor court at Lynelhurst, under the lord warden of the Forest, as lord of that manor rr 2"], [412, "308 THE NEW FOREST. for the time being. The crown is entitled to all the timber on these copyholds. The leaseholds, of which there is now a power to increase the number, are held upon such terms as may be agreed ; \u2014 the only old lease of much extent is Fox lease at Lyndhurst, already alluded to. The encroachments, whether made by cottagers in the way mentioned, or by the neighbouring proprietors, of which there have been several, are held without any rent or acknowledgment to the crown ; but means have been taken to prevent any increase of such encroachments. The forest land is of course the property of the crown; but it is subject to certain rights of pasturage, pannage for hogs, and fuel, to the neighbouring proprietors and their tenants. The abuse, of the fuel part especially, of these common-rights, used to be very injurious to the Forest; but they are now better defined, and more tem perately exercised. DISTRIBUTION AND APPEARANCE OF THE FOREST. We have already hinted that the divergent roads from Lyndhurst are the preferable routes by which to get a com plete notion of the Forest in the shortest time, and with the least labour. The points to which these roads originally led were the lodges of the several walks into which the Forest is divided ; and therefore, a knowledge of their dis tribution is essential at the outset. The whole Forest is divided into the bailiwicks of Burley, Fritham, Godshill, Lynwood, Battramsley, South, and the Nodes, Inn, and North ; and these are subdivided into sixteen walks ; but two of these are double, which reduces the number to four teen. The master keepers are appointed to the bailiwicks, and the under keepers to the walks ; and though some of the bailiwicks are divided, and some walks are called by names different from those of the bailiwicks, they corres pond in extent. Burley forms the walks of Burley and Holmesley ; Fritham forms Boldrewood and Eyeworth ; Godshill forms Ashley; Linwood forms Wilverley and Rhine field ; South bailiwick forms Lady cross and Whitley ridge ;"], [413, "309 THE NEW FOREST. East bailiwick and the Nodes form Denny walk, the Nodes, and Ashurst ; Inn forms Iron's hill ; and North bailiwick forms Bramble hill, and Castle-Malwood. The Forest lands in all these, amount to 63,845 acres, and the lands held with the lodges amount to about 1193, \u2014 making in all 64,038 acres, exclusive of the holdings already mentioned. Ashley walk forms the extreme north-west of the Forest, bounded on the south by Broomy, anel on the east by Eye worth. The lodge of this walk is about eight miles north- Avest of Lyndhurst, and there is no very direct road all the way. Eyeworth, which is about the size and shape of Minstead manor, is bounded on the east by Bramble hill and Castle- Malwood, on the south-east by Boldrewood, and on the south-west by Broomy; and there is no very direct road from Lynelhurst to the lodge here. Broomy has the hundreds of Fordingbridge and Ringwood on the west, Burley on the south, and the walks already mentioned on the north and east; and there is no direct road leading to the lodge of this, any more than to those for merly mentioned. Burley and Holmesley, which form one joint walk, occupy the south-west of the Forest, having Broomy and Boldre wood on the north, and Rhinefield and Wilverley on the east and south-east. The lodge lies in the north-east part of the walk. It stands in a park of more than four hun dred and seventy acres, in which there is a considerable extent of ornamental water, formed by what is called Hitch in's water, which is one of the principal branches of the Boldre. There is a very direct road from Lyndhurst to Burley lodge, a considerable portion of which is along the road from Lyndhurst to Christchurch. With the exception of some small portions of the last-mentioned walk, all those which we have now noticed have their general slope, and the courses of their rivers or brooks, toward the west or south-west ; and they thus naturally form part of the valley of the Avon. \u2014 We shall now return to the north."], [414, "310 THE NEW FOREST. Bramber hill walk, to the east of Eyeworth, occupies the northern angle toward Bramshaw, and is bounded by Castle- Malwood on the south. Castle-Malwood lies to the south of the last-named, but extends much farther eastward; and it is bounded on the south by Boldrewood and the manor of Minstead. This and the lasknamed walk have their inclination toward the east ; and the stream which discharges itself into the South ampton Water at Redbridge, after a bold turn to the north, in the course of which it passes through the park of Poulton, has its source in these walks. ' This is a very interesting part of the Forest, and contains some of the finest timber. Boldrewood walk lies to the south-west of Castle-Mal wood and Minstead, but does not extend quite so far to the eastward as Lyndhurst. Boldrewood lodge has its enclo sure about a mile to the north of Burley lodge, and it is, after that, the largest in the Forest, containing upwards of 180 acres of ground. Iron's hill, to the eastward of Malwood and Boldrewood, extends to the north-east boundary of the Forest, and en closes the manor of Lyndhurst on all sides. The lodge, which has but a small enclosure, is about two miles to the north of Lyndhurst, and about half-a-mile to the left of the road, thence to Redbridge. Rhinefield and Wilverley occu py the southern part of the forest to the westward of the imme diate valley of the Boldre. They are accessible by the main road from Lyndhurst to Lymington. These walks have Bur ley and Holmesley respectively on the west ; and the boun dary line, for a great part of the way, coincides with that of the high road from Lyndhurst to Christchurch. Whitley ridge walk occupies a portion of the Forest to the north of Brockenhurst, and all the irregular parts which are interspersed with the freeholds on the Boldre ; and Laely cross occupies the western part of Burley heath, and all the Forest between the Beaulieu river and the Whitley walk, the centre of which is a naked heath, upon which there are some barrows ; but the slopes toward the streams, on the"], [415, "311 THE NEW FOREST. northern part contain some timber. The slope of Whitley ridge toward the Boldre is in general well wooded, and inter spersed with forest lawns. Denny and the Nodes occupy a long stretch of the Forest, from within about two miles of Lyndhurst, to the extreme south-east. On the eastern dirision of Beaulieu heath there are considerable tracks of bleak moor in this walk. Ashurst occupies a triangular portion to the north of Denny and the east of Iron's hill ; and with it the enumera tion of the walks closes. We shall now take a glance, and it can be but a very passing glance, at the character of the New Forest scenery along some of the principal routes that diverge from Lynd hurst. Here we may in general remark, that the Forest pre sents nothing which impresses one with the idea of that rapid growth and equally rapid decay, which are characteristic of vegetation in the humid parts of tropical climates or upon rich soils which have been forced by artificial culture. Unless in some cultivated spots, which do not in general obtrude themselves upon the view, the New Forest bears the stamp of being a thing of ages, so permanent in its character, that a man of ordinary life, feels that he would require to be born and to die ere any change were worked upon it, except those that accompany the annual vicissitudes of the seasons. It is true, that wherever a new road or vista has been opened up, the continuity has been broken, and the injury done to the singleness and solitude of nature is felt. In such places, though the terminal trees are more lofty in stature than where nature is more perfect, they have all the stiffness, and all the nakedness of a cut hedge ; and the bare boles, and unfinished branchings and sprays, let one see that the nakedness of the forest has been uncovered. Not only this, for its power of resisting the elements has been taken away, so that along these unnatural and unseemly gashes, the trees are rent and rifted, and here and there one is uprooted, while in the natural margins, not a twig is broken. Where all is left as nature made it, the forest has no cut"], [416, "312 THE NEW FOREST. edge, and no offensive straight line, or formal curve. It comes down upon the forest-lawn in little points, of various breadths, and various juttings ; but all melting into the turf, by side-branch, and sometimes shrub and bush, as though the wood and the lawn were one. It is true, indeed, that sometimes a gnarly oak, or hawthorn, will stand out from one of the salient angles, as if it were a sentinel, in watch over the sylvan fort, or a watch-tower, from which the forest hawk can scan the whole extent of the meadow or the moor. There is very considerable variety too in this natural meeting of forest and field. If the meeting is on the most arid heath, the terminal plants straggle out few and far between, and of exceedingly diminutive size ; so that one must walk many yards, in order to get the slightest shade to the view ; but, in proportion as the open glade becomes richer in soil, and covered with more verdant herbage, the margin of the forest rises into more stately masses ; and when the ultimatum is arrived at, and the boles of the trees have advanced to the margin of the waters, their feathering branches are projected over the stream or the pool, and lave their distal sprays in its tide. There is a harmony in this \u2014 a perfect, though a conti nually-varying harmony, which is quite unattainable by the very 'utmost refinement of human art; and it is this which makes a visit to the New Forest so instructive to any one who wishes to gain a genuine feeling of the beauty of na tural landscape. The contrasts which we meet with, of clump and lawn, wood and field, copse and down, in most parts of England, are too artificial, and too much in a state of change for having the stability of genuine beauty ; and when we go to the wilder parts of the country, where rock and mountain, sweeping stream and sounding cascade, come in, the simplicity of genuine beauty is gone, and we behold nature in a mood of excitement. In this, there is no inconsiderable analogy between the land and the sea ; but though the tranquil sea is very beau-"], [417, "THE NEW FOREST. 313 tiful, the sea in storms, and yeasting topmast high upon the slightest obstacle, is not. But there is this difference : the tranquil sea is always beautiful, because human art cannot tamper with and spoil its surface, but it is not so with the land ; for man produces contrasts there, which are perfectly out of nature ; and though these may be, and actually are not only useful but absolutely necessary in art, they never can be naturally beautiful. We offer these few general remarks, merely with refe rence to the New Forest as a natural sight ; the only sense in which it can be generally useful to the observant part of the public, and in which sense it may be said to be perfectly unique \u2014 without a parallel in the country. In most parts of England, the surface and the soil are too uniform, and in most places, it may be, too rich, for allowing of that per fection of natural beauty and harmony which is found in a district so peculiar as the New Forest, and which has, in the greater part of its extent, been left to the uncontrolled operation of nature for so many centuries, \u2014 probably, in many places, since the tertiary formation over the chalk was first deposited upon it by the action of the w7aters of some troubled and turmoiling sea. In every direction which one can take from central Lynd hurst to the outskirts of the Forest, \u2014 by carriage-drive, by bridle-road, or by footpath, there is a diversity in each indi vidually, and yet no two are alike ; and, in order to see all the beauty of each, one should go and return, for it often happens in such scenes, that when we take them in review, all the deformities of the direct view are turned into beauties. To a visitor from the metropolitan or central parts of the country, the road by which the advance is made upon Lyndhurst, is naturally the first one ; and to one who wishes to obtain correct notions of the whole Forest, it is certainly better than breaking in by any other route. Here, upon turning ones back upon the Union Poors' house, and arriving at the boundary of the Forest, there is room and air enough to make one lose the recollection of those artificial scenes, VOL. II. ss"], [418, "314 THE NEW FOREST. which are apt to rise in suggestion, and spoil, by their formal presence, the feeling of such a place as this. There are no trees close to the road for some distance in advance ; and yet the groups muster so on either hand that they mark the formalities of Ashurst lodge on the left, and then of Iron's hill lodge on the right. It is true that the enclosure near Castick's pond is a little out of keeping ; but then it is so near the Hunter's inn that one may fancy it not quite in the Forest ; and then there is very soon metal more attractive on the left, in the fine indefinite vista that opens up in the direction of Pond-head farm. Beyond this, the trees close in upon the sides of the road, but not in such uniform and serried array as to tempt any one to fancy that some inter meddling \" Capability \" had drilled and driven them there. The high road, too, keeps any unseemly formality that may arise here and there in some sort of countenance ; and cer tainly if there had been a green lane here, it would have spoiled much of the beauty of the place ; for it would have been a forest bottom to the path, without genuine forest sides ; and we are not aware that nature ever made a forest vista so straight as the road is here, except in some unfor tunate case, where a mountain whirlwind had rent its way clear through an artificial plantation of pines, as we once saw one do on the highlands of Scotland, cracking the forty-feet sticks by the roots, as though they had been dry bean-stalks, or rotten hop-poles. Some of the straggling trees by the way side here, are eminently picturesque as single studies ; and many of the larger ones are very fine ; though none ,of them have anything very remarkable in their dimensions. They are not, in any place, so closely set as to appear sickly and spindled ; and they are clumpy, so as to give one the idea that even the densest tracts of the Fo rest are interspersed with glades. There is also no \"offence of art,\" \u2014 no temple, obelisk, or fancy gate, to spoil the con gruity of this Forest. When Lyndhurst makes its appear ance, it would be an eye-sore were it not that the high road leads one to expect something. Perhaps it is not quite"], [419, "315 THE NEW FOREST. rustic enough ; but it is redeemed in this way by Mount royal, the seat of J. Pulteney, Esq. ; Cuffnel's, of Lady Poore ; and Fox-lease, of F. W. Powell, Esq. ; which are not exactly in keeping. Still, they afford the advantage of contrast, which, to many, is one of the best means of setting off the beauties of nature ; and thus, perhaps, if these contrasts were wanting, the charms of the forest might be lessened to many, to whom these spots of art are more agreeable than the beauties of nature. There is one other matter which is especially at variance with good taste, and that is the roots of the felled trees, which obtrude their dingy discs upon one in so many places. We know that timber must be had ; but that does not take off the painful feeling which one who loves the forest has at the felling of a tree. We must have animal food ; and yet the bleeding carcases of lambs scattered among the flock upon a hill-side, would be no very pretty object to look at. A tree is a living production of nature, as well as an animal, and it the more claims our sympathy that, if stately, it is a thing of fifty animal lives, and it can of itself make no effort to escape from its murderers. In the case of the animal, we hide the deed of death, and every memorial of it ; and wherefore not do the same in the case of the tree'? It ought to be borne in mind, too, that the decaying substance of its own species is poisonous to a plant as wTell as to an animal ; and thus, the carrion of trees \u2014 so to speak \u2014 which laziness leaves lumbering here, taints the forest air, and injures the health of the growing timber. Nor this alone ; for every root which is left in the ground remains there at the expense of a self-sown sapling. Thus the felling of the timber, when done in a slovenly manner, is a double deso lation \u2014 desolation in what it does and Avhat it prevents. Every root therefore ought to be grubbed up, and the soil turned until a fresh surface from some depth is exposed ; and then there is at once, and without labour or expense, a proper soil for the acorn. When one looks at the state of things, even with the most cursory and casual glance, one ss 2"], [420, "316 THE NEW FOREST. would be tempted to suppose that the superintendents of this Royal Forest, have all along been selected for their great ignorance of the economy of trees ; and that they had all along instructed those under them to do as little work, and as much mischief in the doing of it, as possible. Far be it from us to say positively that any such selection has been made, even at the most distant and depraved period, on account of the ignorance of the party ; for we believe that capacity and incapacity have, or at least used to have, about equal weight in such matters. But there is a very obvious general principle : \u2014 The New Forest is a self-planted forest, and it has been self-maintained upon the same ground for a thousand years certainly, and one knows not how much longer. In these latter times it has fallen off, not only much more than it did formerly, but in a much greater ra tio than the quantity of timber which has been taken from it for the use of the navy will explain. From this the infe rence is irresistible \u2014 there must have been both spoliation and mis-management. Every one knows, at all events, every one connected with this Forest ought to knoAV, that the keeping of deer in any numbers in a forest is perfectly incompatible with the fell ing of timber in the same ; at least perfectly incompatible with the continuance of the forest, beyond the stock that may be upon it when the joint means of destruction begin to operate. The natural function of the deer is nearly the same as that of the woodman, only the deer destroys the young plants, and the woodman the grown ones. In this way, the deer alone is a conservator, by preventing the groAvth of superabundant trees, which would waste substance, keep out the air, and cause untimely death, whereas the woodman is, in all cases, a destroyer. Why are the heads of deer furnished with such branching horns, but to keep them out of the thickness of the forest, at all times save during that portion of the year when their horns are shed % But the axe of the woodman, by taking out the best trees, gives them free range at all times ; and thus not a sapling"], [421, "317 THE NEW FOREST. can grow, unless in places which are enclosed. It is but of late years that enclosing was at all practised in the New Forest ; and the manner in which it is done now is very questionable, both as to the quantity of timber, and as to its quality. There is a distinction in the official name which is wor thy of notice here : the style runs \" Woods and Forests \" which clearly shows that they are not things of the same kind, nor can they be obtained on the same ground in equal perfection as though they were alone. The gigantic size of the fossil stag, compared with the preserved stag of modern times, shows that the animal is not so much in its element as when untrammeled by artificial circumstances ; and the people of this country have found to their cost that no arti ficially-bred timber can at all come up to the produce of the self-maintaining forest. Therefore, if they will have deer in the New Forest, they have no business to grumble about the timber ; and if they will have timber, for the most valua ble description of which the New Forest is probably better adapted than any other spot in the British Islands, let them dispatch the deer as speedily as possible \u2014 send them to some park, where timber is merely grown for ornament, and where any rubbish that can be planted at such a size as soon to be safe from deer, and which will grow fast enough for scenic purposes, is all that is necessary. Deer we admit are handsome animals ; but so are tigers and leopards ; and in a cultivated country, the one are just as much out of congruity and keeping as the others. Having mentioned some of the Carnivora, we may mention that the smaller species of these animals are most essential to the safety of a forest ; and without them and large num bers of them, there is no security for the success of extensive plantations. Every one must have heard of the plague of mice in the forest of Dean, and how speedily they killed the young trees by tens of thousands. Now, we rather suspect that these animals, \u2014 the Viverrid\u0153 we specially allude to \u2014 though the wild cat is a glorious mouser, and most efficient"], [422, "318 THE NEW FOREST. against the plague of rabbits ; \u2014 we rather suspect that there is a deficiency of these animals ; for keepers kill vermin by instinct, and it is questionable whether the under-keepers here have yet forgotten the whole of the practices which they learned while permitted to spoil the Forest with rab bits. \u2014 Such are some of the reflections that naturally arise in suggestion, when one contemplates the New Forest ; and it is better to let them come, on the way from the entrance to Lyndhurst, so that ones observation and enjoyment may not be interrupted by them afterwards. When Lyndhurst is arrived at, which is over an open lawn or moor, after one has cleared the wood, and with a beautiful Forest opening on the right, across the Lyndhurst race-ground in the direction of Minstead, \u2014 when this is done, what route shall be taken across the Forest, must depend upon the time and object of the party. Our limits forbid even the briefest glance at more than one or two, and we shall take the high roads, though these have some degree of sameness, and are not in themselves natural parts of the Forest. If the high road from Lyndhurst to Cadnam is not the most beautiful it is the one nearest the entrance, and that which leads the most conveniently to one of those sections of the Forest which we mentioned. This road, and that to the boundary of the Forest at Brockenhurst bridge, are nearly of the same length \u2014 about three miles and a half each, but this gets one perhaps more immediately into Forest ground. For the first mile and a half there is not much timber im mediately on the road ; but on the right, the lobes of Forest come down very finely upon the north-eastern margin of the race-course lawn ; and the opening on the left, along the high moor, southward of Minstead, is also very pleasant. At the end of this distance the road plunges into the thick trees of Malwood walk. The varied level of the ground prevents the dull length of it from being seen at once, not withstanding its straightness ; but the successive distances"], [423, "319 THE NEW FOREST. which present themselves are just, one formal notch in the wood after another ; so that this, though through a thickly wooded part of the Forest, is one of the dullest roads in it. The road to Brokenhurst is also provokingly straight ; but Whitby wood is not quite so formal in its outlines ; and then, when one gets clear of it on the left, within about three quarters-of-a-mile of the bridge, and peeps round to the left, there is a gallant scene : a forest lawn of fine form, ample size, and fresher herbage than is usually met with iu these parts ; and the advanced and retired outlines of the Forest make their own distances, while those which swell and crowd, mass upon mass, toward the Boldre, seem to stand sentinels at the gate of plenty. It is well that no view-hunter's portfolio will hold this scene ; and thus every visitor has it new and fresh ; but keep \" eyes left \" till you are dazzled \u2014 you will not soon be tired; for, before you is Brokenhurst, and though it is well enough in its way, yet \u2014 exit the Forest. Upon arriving at Cadnam, if observation within the Forest is the subject, it is best to turn sharp to the left, and take the road to Ringwood. The first part of this road, that is about two miles and a quarter to the Inn at Stoney Cross, is a place of sights. First, there is the Cadnam or Caden ham oak, which used to be remarkable for the miracle of spreading its buds on the morning of Christmas day, and causing them to wither after that solemn day was over. But, somehow or other, tbe alteration of the style has deprived the Cadnam oak of its miraculous power : \u2014 in other words, the monks of ancient times, to serve their own purposes, had taught the rustics to stick this tree all over with buds forced by artificial heat, upon the night preceding old Christmas, which of course withered in the course of the day ; and the rustics, for the sake of eclat and pence, kept up the deception as long as they could. The next subject of observation is Castle Malwood, which stands on the left-hand of the road, about a mile and a quarter from Cadnam. It is an old fort, approaching to a square form, and of considerable extent,"], [424, "320 THE NEW FOREST. with the old rampart covered with trees, and the lodge of the walk upon what has once been the pretorium or keep. It has only a single vallum, and has never been a place of great strength. It is situated on a knoll, and therefore, though little is known of its historv, it does not appear to be of Roman origin. At a little distance on the road, and to ward the right-hand, a pleasant little dell opens in the woods, which are here in great part composed of beech. This is the spot where stood the oak from which tradition says the arrow of Tyrrel glanced when it killed William Rufus. This oak mouldered away about the middle of last century, and Lord Delawarre set up in its place a triangular stone, recording on its three sides, the mode of William's death on the second of August ; the removal of his body, on the cart of Purkiss the charcoal burner ; and the erection of the stone by his lord ship, in 1745. But the stone has been a far more frail memo rial than the oak, for it has been sadly mutilated ; and is now as silent, on all points of history, as the quondam tree. We have no room to enter into the merits of this very unsettled point of history ; but we have great doubts whether any well intentioned subject could direct an arrow in such a moment, as that it would glance from a tree, and wounded a monarch to the heart. It would be rather difficult to do this even with a bullet, unless that bullet glanced at a very small angle ; and if an arrow is deflected, even a little from its course, its velocity is in great part destroyed. Therefore the glance must have been so slight, that it would be very difficult to say whether Tyrrel aimed more directly at the tree or at Rufus. Upon physical grounds we doubt the possibility of death by the glanced arrow, and we challenge the best nerved and practical Taxophilite in England to the experi mental proof: and let him show that he can drive his glanced arrow from a tree through an ordinary canvas target. On the other hand, we have every reason to believe that there were, among the religeuse, whom William restrained in their rapacity, many who would have been anxious to get rid of him by any means ; and the evidence that Tyrrel was bribed"], [425, "ll,,,.J,e.,i,fA,/,/,rl,f,/ s\u201er rf\u201e fiopr^lor uE.'

We have no wish to cloke the tyranny of William Rufus, any more than we had to cloke that of his father, when we endeavoured to show that his conduct in the New Forest has been grossly misrepresented by the monkish libellers. We believe that William partook of that fiery and tyrannical dis position, which was so common in his days, that it was de grading to be without it ; but we suspect, if his history could be brought fairly out, it would be found that Rufus was a high-spirited sovereign ; and, notwithstanding his French wars and their expense, did something to free his subjects, both from the thraldom of the church, and from that abject slavery in which the bondsmen were kept by the Saxons. It is worthy of mention, that some of the more cautious of the monkish historians merely say that the arrow of Tyrrel was \" untowardly \" directed ; and that the one who gives the most circumstantial account of the whole matter is Knygh ton; who also gives the most extravagantly exaggerated account of the churches destroyed by the Conqueror in the New Forest. One farther instance of this disposition to ex aggerate, is given by Hennyngforde, as quoted in Grafton's Chronicle. He says, that a Saxon church stood upon the spot where Rufus was killed, and that William pulled down this church in order to enlarge his chase. Now this spot is within a mile of the northern boundary of the Forest ; and the only manor which is mentioned in Doomsday book as then existing in those parts is Minstead, which is just about another mile into the Forest ; and, as we have already said, William left the arable land in the meadow, with the former pannage for hogs, in the hands of the same Saxon family who held it before the Conquest ; therefore, it is perfectly absurd to suppose that William would have reserved a manor in one of the best places of the Forest, and destroyed a church within one mile of the boundary. The same Saxon family held the manors of Bistern and Avon, to the south of Ringwood ; and it appears that they were allowed three- VOL. II. TT"], [428, "322 THE NEW FOREST. fourths of a hide free of tax, in consideration of the parts of Minstead and Bistern taken into the Forest. But the Nor man Williams were sadly belied, and belied because they made a most rapacious clergy disgorge a little, and at the same time tried to inspire dignity of character into the great body of the people. As we have already said, we offer no opinion upon either point ; but both the physical and the metaphy sical evidence are strong that Rufus fell by the hand of an assassin set on by the churchmen ; and this too for what would have been called patriotism had it happened in mo dern times. Our view of these ancient matters cannot how ever be purer than the medium through which it is seen. In pursuing this road, there are several triangular tours which may be made to Lyndhurst. First, a little beyond Stoney cross, near a place where there are several lawns on the height, one may turn to the left, and reach Lyndhurst after a tour of between eight and nine miles. The path here is for the most part upon open ground, with only scattered clumps of stunted trees ; but it is not without its beauties. Secondly, one can proceed about two miles farther, through a diversified surface of moor and dale, and return by Boldre wood lodge. This part is much more thickly wooded. Thirdly, one may proceed between three and four miles far ther to Picked post, the greater part of which way is along an open moor, though with clumps of wood in the distance, except to the south-west and south, where there is an as semblage of singular round knolls. Taking the sharpest turn to the left, at the post, one can return by Burley lodge to Lyndhurst, along a winding road rather more than seven miles long. The first part of this road is along the open moors ; but, after about three miles, it is wooded the whole way ; and, as all the principal branches of the Boldre have to be crossed upon this return, perhaps it is one of the rich est lines in the Forest. It is worth while to turn aside at Burley and examine the grounds ; and the eminences all along the line command fine views. What we have noticed form but a small portion of the tours which may be made"], [429, "323 THE NEW FOREST. within the Forest so as to return to the same point ; but our limits forbid the insertion of any more ; neither can we notice single trees or any other detached objects. FOREST ANIMALS. The only animals of the New Forest, which we have either necessity or room to particularize as having anything peculiar about them, are the horses and the hogs. It has been supposed that both of these animals are of different breeds from those met with in any other parts of England, that the horses have Spanish blood in them, obtained by some unknown import from that country, and that the hogs were crossed by wild boars obtained from the forests of Ger many by King Charles \u2014 or somebody else. In the case of supposed Spanish blood in horses, it is usual to have recourse to wrecked ships of the Armada, as a general means of in troduction, but we believe this is not resorted to in the case of the New Forest. As the Britons appear to have had horses long before C\u00e6sar's invasion, it is highly probable that the original horses of England belonged to the south ern distribution of horses, and not to the northern ; and the form of the head in the New Forest horse certainly has more resemblance to the Arab than the Calmuc, and these are considered as the typical races. It is probable that, generally speaking, the southern horses were the first brought to the west of Europe ; as it does not appear that either the valley of the Danube, or the country between the Carpathian mountains and the Baltic was, in those early days, very practicable for the transit of horses. The New Forest horses are, or at least used to be, in a semi-wild state ; and some of them absolutely ownerless. These are of small size, and somewhat shaggy appearance ; but they are firmly knit, have much strength and spirit, and are remarkably sure-footed. Those which are property be long mostly to such as have right of common in the Forest ; and they shift for themselves there summer and winter, re sorting to the furze in severe weather, and they stamp it tt 2"], [430, "324 THE NEW FOREST. with the fore-foot before they attempt itp mastication. This teaches a lesson which mankind fancy they have found out for themselves in other parts of the country. In furzy places, the tops of furze, well beaten with a mallet, are found to be excellent winter feed for horses ; and those natives of the New Forest resort to the same. These horses are allowed to shift for themselves in their early years ; and, generally speaking, their owners are too poor, or have too little consideration, for allowing them thus to range until they attain their maturity, which is at the age of seven or eight years. At this age, they are difficult to break; but when this is once accomplished, they are very docile, and remarkable for strength, speed, and longevity. Various anecdotes have been told of individuals thus matured in the forest, which we have no room to mention, but we have no doubt of their authenticity, because it is in perfect accordance with the general analogy of nature, which is, that you never can tamper with either animal or plant, by artifici al training and tending in its young years, without breaking in upon its constitution. The reason is obvious: nature knows the whole character and competency of the species in all its systems, and works to them all equally ; man knows but in part, and therefore he necessarily improves one pro perty at the expense of another. The superiority of these horses, when properly attended to, and the fact that horses are far less injurious in a forest than deer, or any other ruminant animals, suggest an idea which is not unworthy the consideration of those more imme diately concerned. \u2014 The commonage of the forest, whether for horses, hogs, or any other animals, is, like some other privileges granted in the dark times, of very questionable value to those who enjoy it. It is this upon principle, and the principle is justified by the fact. The principle is, that advantages which people enjoy gratis, over and above what is enjoyed by others of their class, induce laziness, and therefore do harm instead of good ; and the fact is, that the persons who enjoy these New Forest privileges, are among"], [431, "325 THE NEW FOREST. the most wretched and most worthless in the whole king dom. Therefore, in kindness to the parties themselves, the sooner that such privileges are put an end to the better. Banish deer and hogs, and all other animals, that have right of common, and turn the forage of the entire Forest into a breeding-ground for horses. Say that it would require twenty acres for each horse, there is. still keep for 3000 ; and allow ing them to be seven years old before they are disposed of, there would be between 400 and 500 to dispose of annually, and with proper attention these would be worth at least 20/. each, which would bring to the public treasury above 5000/. a year, not only without great deterioration of the timber, but with great advantage to it ; and this annual return of the horses would be worth at least twice of the whole live stock at present in the Forest. This would be a something to the public purse, though only a something. That the public however would gain is only a small item of the advantage ; for those who required, would be able to command horses of the most efficient description, and capable of subsisting at the smallest cost, in the very prime of their age, and when they would be far more efficient for labour than horses which are forced and prematurely brought to maket, in the present hot-house style. The New Forest affords by far the most eligible ground in England for an establishment of this kind ; but there are many other parts of the country where it could be supplied with very great advantage. With regard to the New Forest hogs, we have not much faith in the report that Charles I introduced German wild boars into this Forest, though the Forest hogs have certainly more resemblance to wild hogs, than the hogs which one meets with in the other parts of the country. As is the case with the wild boar, the strength of the forest hog, especially the male, is thrown chiefly upon the fore part of the animal ; while in the bred hog, the object has been to throw more of the weight of the animal upon the hams, as being the more valuable joints in a mercantile point of view. The shoulders of these hogs are remarkably broad and firm, and the neck"], [432, "326 THE NEW FOREST. and shoulders have an erectable mane of long bristles. The ears are short and stand up, and the colour is in general dark, brindled, or black. The hinder parts of the animal are com paratively slender, and there is an elasticity about the whole appearance of it, very different from the uniform heaviness, fore and aft, of a sluggish hog of the stye. It is also a more sportive, and a far braver animal, than the hog of a cham pagne country, and few dogs unless they are trained to it, will venture to go in upon a New Forest boar. At the same time, these hogs are not vicious ; and, like all the order of animals to which they belong, they never begin an attack unless they apprehend danger, anel seldom till they are actually attacked. The characters which we have now mentioned, certainly show that the animal has been in part brought back to its natural appearance and disposition, and we may presume that the chief cause of this has been the placing of it more nearly in its natural circumstances and situation than can be the case with its co-species, in the cultivated parts of the country. The natural food of the hog is roots, at least at those times when the trees shower down no fruit ; and as the fruit of most forest trees falls along with the leaves only, the hog has to nozzle for these as well as for roots ; therefore it is that his strength naturally concentrates upon the ante rior part of his body. In his ordinary feeding, he does not require to move fast ; and when play, or fear, or anger, sets him a scampering, it is always at a gallop. In the New Forest there are, or at least there used to be, three different sorts of hogs, in treatment, if not in variety. The first are the pannage hogs, which are understood to be there only for a limited time ; the second, are the hogs of the under keepers, which go habitually in the Forest, but have some attention paid them ; and the third are a sort of wild hogs, which are left to themselves, and captured when they are best got hold of, and are in tolerable condition. The parts of the Forest which are best adapted for the pasturage of hogs, are those in which the beech predomi nates ; and though there are beeches in many parts of the"], [433, "327 THE NEW FOREST Forest, Boldre wood walk is the region in which they are most abundant. Beech-mast is equally valuable for feeding deer as for feeding hogs, and therefore venison obtained from that walk, after the mast begins to fall, which is about the end of September, is held in high estimation. In speak ing of beech-mast and pannage, we feel disposed, for the mast season at least, to exempt the porkers. Horses do not eat beech-mast or acorns, and hogs do no harm to Forest trees, at that season when they subsist upon mast and acorns. Therefore, there is no particular objection to the admission of hogs, during the pannage weeks ; but upon the whole it would probably be an advantage. Be that as it may, the pannage hogs are admitted into the wood, which we have mentioned, and also into various other parts of the Forest, though this is understood to be the favourite part. The Forest appears to have been free to the thanes and border ers, in the time of the Saxons, and there is no evidence that any part of the freedom was taken away by William. Those who have this right, have to pay yearly a trifling guerdon in the Steward's court at Lyndhurst, bearing some proportion to the number for which they have a right ; and this being done, the pannage month, which is six weeks from about the end of September, is insured. \" Gurth \" the swineherd is then in requisition ; and though the name of his office does not sound so respectably as some others, the office itself re quires a little pratice. He first selects a convenient spot, where there is plenty of food and water, forms a rude stye of the dimensions he thinks he shall require, and then goes in quest of the herd. These he collects from the different borderers who have the right, and he drives his motley herd toward the habitation which is prepared for them ; and he takes especial care that a hearty supper shall be provided for the grunting travellers, so that they may know and like their inn. This repast consists of acorns and beech-mast, the former of which from the peculiar nature of their rinds are greatly preferred by the grunting strangers. A long journey and a hearty supper send hogs of all denominations"], [434, "328 THE NEW FOREST. very speedily to sleep ; and therefore the pannage hogs are speedily locked in the arms of Morpheus, and doze out the night most comfortably upon their general couch of dry leaves, or straw, or fern, as may happen. Next morning, they have the remains of the supper for breakfast, with water from the pool, or stream, the way to which is led by the swineherd ; and when evening comes, he causes a shower of mast, and acorns to be rained upon them, he blowing his horn the while ; and after supper and tattoo, they again go to sleep. Next morning, they are breakfasted to the sound of the horn ; and they get a little liberty in the course of the day ; but they come home at night in very regular order, and after the second day, they are in general completely trained, though the training is assisted by the introduction of an old pannage hog as leader to every section of the herd. After this break ing in, they come and go regularly at the stated hours, and may be summoned at any time by the horn ; and when, as sometimes happens, acorns and mast do not fall in requisite quantity, the horn brings them to a full meal which has been prepared for them by their governor. Such is the mode of managing pannage hogs in the New Forest, and such it has been for many years. If the swineherd is a man of talent in his way, the hogs are turned out in excellent con dition, and very little more expense fits them for the market ; though the sentimental will perhaps regret, that this enjoy ment, even in the case of hogs, should be so soon followed by the operation of the knife. This particular time of the year, is the grand feast of the porkers ; and such of them as summer and winter it in the Forest, do not upon the whole fare so well. In this too there is another consideration. The hogs during the acorn and mast season, that is the pannage month, do harm to nothing in the Forest ; for one may rest assured that while they can find abundance of such fruits as those of the oak and the beech, they will never fatigue their noses by deforming the ground, or ploughing up a single root ; and this is the chief reason why'no sound objection can be taken to pannage hogs in the Forest."], [435, "329 THE NEW FOREST. Those hogs which subsist in the Forest for the whole year round, have a somewhat harder life, and they do a little more mischief, as they must betake themselves to turning over the ground in quest of roots, when the season affords them no other species of nourishment. They however, unless they are artificially assisted after the fall of the trees is ex hausted, fare much worse than the hogs of which we have been speaking ; and it might probably be better, that none of these perennial hogs were permitted in the Forest. The third sort of hogs are those which are abandonee! to the Forest, and are left to die or live as they may, when the ground is sealed up by frost, and little remains on the surface for such an animal. To tolerate them is, in our opinion, a species of most gratuitous cruelty, and the sooner they are expelled the Forest the better. In proportion as the hogs approximate the condition of these absolutely neglected ones, they depart from the form of what is accounted a valuable hog by the breeders of these animals ; and therefore, the hogs which are habitually kept in the Forest, whether with some attention, or in a state of utter neglect, are the least valuable of the whole, and therefore the ones with which it would be most desirable to dispense. Besides, they are very generally speaking the property of the under keepers, anel it is desirable that they should not be breeders of hogs. One of the greatest mischiefs of the Forest has indeed been the paying of such parties as these out of some part of the property or produce of the Forest, to be taken at their own hands, and this we are sorry to say, has a very great tendency, not only to make them bad servants to the public, but to undermine their honesty. It is especially desirable that no servant of the public should have his remuneration out of that part of the public property of which he has the charge ; and it is still more desirable that he should neither have the permission nor the power to do this at his own instigation. OFFICERS OF THE NEW FOREST. A simple enumeration of these will be all that is neces- VOL II. uu"], [436, "330 THE NEW FOREST. sary here ; for, whatever they may have been in former times, the most honorable offices, at least those which have the most sounding names, and have attracted men of the most lofty stations, are noAV little better than empty titles. This might be expected, inasmuch as that which formed the ori ginal value of the Forest has now become a matter of com parative insignificance \u2014 namely, the driving of the deer with hound and horn within the limits of the same. Kings and queens, in these our times, have got other occupations; and when such a spectacle as a stag-hunt is got up, the animal is brought to the ground in a litter as if he were an invalid ; and the obtaining of such deer as are obtained from the royal forests \u2014 and the numbers are not very great, is a sort of brigand matter, the animals being most ignobly laid in wait for and shot from behind a cover, as if the keeper were a poacher of the lowest class, \u2014 to so low a pass has \" the noble art of Venerie \" come in these our degenerate times \u2014 albeit the hunters of yore had no venison equal in flavour and healthfulness to our Southdown mutton. The chief officer of the Forest is the lord warden, who is appointed by letters-patent during the royal pleasure. In virtue of his patent he holds the manor of Lyndhurst, and hundred of Redbridge, with the office of keeper of the decoy ponds ; and his emoluments are the possession of the King's house at Lyndhurst, the herbage, pannage, and rents of the free tenants. Avith 70/. a year for repair of the house, amount ing in all nominally to the sum of 214/. Another patent officer is the riding forester, whose office is to ride before the sovereign when in the Forest, for which he receives 500/., and a buck and doe annually from the Forest; a third pa tent officer is the woodward, who has charge of the timber cut down for the use of the Navy. He has 200/. for him self, besides a salary for a deputy, and some perquisites. There are several officers appointed by the lore! warden, the most honourable of Avhieh is understood to be the bow bearer, who attends the sovereign whenever it is the royal pleasure to shoot deer with bow and arrows, which it is the"], [437, "331 THE NEW FOREST. business of this officer to supply : 40 shillings a year, with a buck and doe, are the guerdon of this once important officer. The high steward is appointed by the lord warden, from whom he receives an annual guerdon of 5/., but he has literally nothing to do. The under steward is also appoint ed by the lord warden. He is generally a lawyer, holds the Courts Leet and Baron, and is paid by the parties. The master, the groom keepers, the keeper of the decoy ponds, and also the rangers of the Forest, are appointed by the warden: these last have small salaries, and a buck and doe yearly each. Some officers of the Forest are chosen by the freeholders of the County. Of these are the verderers, who are judges of the Swanimote and Attachment Courts. They have a guerdon of a buck and doe yearly. The regarders are also chosen by the County. They see that the trees to be felled are properly marked, value the timber for sale, and attend the sales, for which they receive half-a-crown a day, when on duty. The under keepers are, we believe, appointed by the master keepers ; and their emoluments had wont to be derived chiefly from plundering timber, and from rabbits and hogs ; but, we believe, the objectional parts are now a little better than they had wont to be. Besides these officers, there is a purveyor of wood for the Navy ; and a deputy surveyor of Woods and Forests, appoint ed by the surveyor-general ; and we believe that his various emoluments, which were admirably calculated for the old fashioned purpose of jobbing, are now converted into an annual salary of about 3000/. a year ; but what he does in return for this sum of money, seems to be a problem of which there is no apparent solution. \u2014 Such are the officers of the New\" Forest, \u2014 a most curious compound of the anti quated, and the unnecessary. That the ground occupied by the New Forest ever could, at least in great part of its extent, be profitably brought under culture, is a very questionable matter ; and as it is of importance that a country, where warlike marine is the uu 2"], [438, "332 THE NEW FOREST. strong tower of its defence, and whose mercantile marine is one of the main sources of its wealth, should always pos- sess within itself a good supply of this timber, which experi- ence shows is better and more durable, if grown iu England, than in any other part of the world, with the exception of the teak(Tectona grandis) of India, there cannot be a bet- ter national use of the district in question than keeping it as a forest, and paying more constant and more scientific attention to the growth of timber than has hitherto been done. In former times, spoliation and robbing have gone so far, that it will probably be long before the Forest, even with the best management, shall be what it may and might have been ; but still, the sooner that this reformation is set about the better. The first thing to be done, is to ascer- tain, by well conducted experiments, whether any one of the different varieties of oaks which are met with in the Forest combines, in a more perfect degree than the others, the two essential qualities of free growth and resistance of dry-rot ; another subject of inquiry is, whether there is any circum- stance connected with the present mode of endeavouring to produce timber, which tends to deteriorate its quality ; and a third is, whether any of the other species of timber trees, which are certainly invading the oaks in many parts of the Forest, do any injury to the growth or the timber of the said oaks. We are inclined to think that the whole pine fa mily, and perhaps also the beeches, have some pernicious effect in this way ; but the point can be settled only by fair and well-conducted experiment.
