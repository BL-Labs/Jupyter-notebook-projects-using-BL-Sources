In respectfully acknowledging the indulgence of the Public to his long and arduous Undertaking, the Author ventures to hope for their Patronage of the present Work, which completes the Series of his Topographical Labours ; and which he will endeavour to explain in the following order ; I. Ofthe manner and period, when the Crown of Scotland was merged in that of England, and oT The Union of the tAvo Kingdoms, by the name of Great Britain. II. Ofthe method adopted to obtain accurate Information. III. Of the general arrangement and execution of the present Work. I. The earliest ages ofthe Scotish Annals, like the first origin of Nations in general, have been considered by some able Writers, as the wild region of mere fable. But, it seems probable, that the Aborigines of Scotland were the same Gaelic Clans, who, at a very remote period, settled in England.* The Romans, in extending their conquests over the various Nations whom they had resolved to bring under their obedience, were never at a loss for some specious pretence, for going to war with thera ; hoAvever slight in reality the cause, or however remote the situation ofthe people. No sooner had C\u00e6sar subdued the principal states of Gaul, than being in formed that in almost all his wars with the enemies of the Republic they had constantly received assistance from Britain, he resolved to pass over into that Island. This Resolution was effected on the 26th of August, Fifty-five years before the birth of Christ. After various engagements, in which the Britons made a * Chalmers's Caledonia, vol. 1 p. 57."], [20, "PREFACE. VIII gallant resistance, they were at length reduced to obedience. And, in the year 78 of the Christian \u00c6ra, the Romans, by the bravery and enterprize of their Generals, had not only reduced the South parts of the Island to the form ofa Province, but had even extended their conquests over South Wales, and the Middle and Northern Comities of England.* At this juncture, Julius Agricola was appointed lo the command. North Britain noAV consisted of several tribes, who were only connected together by the slight ties of a common origin, similar customs, and the same speech. Caledonia, in its largest extent, from the Tweed and the Eden, on the South, to Caithness Point on the North, Avas possessed by TAventy-One tribes of Aborigi nal Britons, who Avere populous, in proportion to the greater or less fertility of the Districts, which they severally occupied. i* The genius and disposition of Agricola was martial. And, in the third year of his command, Caledonia was first taught to feel the terror of his arms, when he carried his devastations through the several Nations quite to the mouth of the Tay. Subsequent victories enlarged the Roman Empire, by extend ing its limits to the Moray Firth : and the Admiral of his Fleet sailed round Britain. % On the recall of Agricola in the year 85, the newly acquired Provinces were, according to Tacitus, immediately lost again. And in this state they continued, until the reign of Antoninus Pius, in 120. The Romans were now, under dif ferent Emperors, obliged to carry on very troublesome Avars with the Caledo nians, whom with much difficulty they reduced to obedience. But the distresses and difficulties of the Empire making it necessary to recall the Legions, the Scots and Picts immediately seized the opportunity, and passing the Firths, not only laid waste the whole Province of Valentia, but even threatened the more distant parts Avith universal desolation. \u00a7 Thus, about the year 420, the Romans finally departed the Island : between Avhich time and the first landing of Julius C\u00e6sar, there intervenes a period of 476 years, that they were more or less in possession of Great Britain. On the abdication of the Romans, the Pictish period commenced ; which ap pears to have been little more than a tissue of domestic contentions, aud foreign war. Its greatest glory was its conversion to Christianity in the reign of Bridei, * Roy's Milit. Antiq. p. 13. f Chalmers's Caledonia, vol. 1. p. 57. X Roy's Milit.

But, in addition to the evils of Civil war, they were exposed to the destructive incursions of their enterprising neighbours, the Norwegians and Danes. And, at length, distracted by the violent succession of their Kings, and enfeebled by wasteful invasion, the Pictish Government yielded to the arms and policy of Kenneth, the son of Alpin, King ofthe Scots, in 843. If it were asked, why the name of Scotland was not applied to the Caledonian regions, for several years after that memorable epoch, the answer must be, that the Picts remained in possession of them, as the predominating people. The Picts being the old Caledonians, under a new name.* The great exploit of Kenneth led to the Union of the Picts, and Scots; the former of whom appear to have resided beyond the Wall of Antoninus, and the latter on the Western Coast. A long line of Monarchs now succeeded; when Malcolm the Third, in 1057, ascended the Throne ; from which period greater civilization begun to take place, and the history becomes more authentic. The extinction of the ancient line of Kings, in the person of Margaret, of Norway, Grand-daughter of Alexander the Third, in 1290, occasioned the arbitrary interposition of Edward the First, King of England, which was the source of that enmity which afterwards unhappily prevailed between the two Kingdoms, In 1371, notwithstanding the intrigues of Edward the Third, and the solicita tions of David the Second, Robert, The Steward of Scotland, succeeded to tbe Crown : a family eminently remarkable for unfortunate Princes. On the Accession of James the Sixth, in 1603, the CroAvns of England, and Scotland, were united by the voice of policy, and of right : but the Union of t;.e two Kingdoms was attempted in vain. The fatal discord that had so long pre vailed between the tAvo Nations, \" invincible by all arms but their oun,'A\" was now extinguished, and an unusual calm ensued within his ancient Dominions. The events of the subsequent Century were various, and momentous. At length, on the 22d of July 1706, Articles were signed by The Commissioners, who were appointed to treat of an Union between England and Scotland, which thereafter were to form one Kingdom, by the name of Great Britain. * Chalmers's Caledonia, vol. 1. pp. 198, 209, 213, 225. *t Gough's Camden. vol. 3. p. 281. vol. i. b"], [22, "PREFACE.

The Isle of Man has also been included, upon the grounds of its having con stituted part of the Territories belonging to Scotland, in 1266 : although it was taken under the protection ofEDAVARD the First, in 1290; and, in 1307, assumed as his OAvn.* III.

Hoav early, and at what particular period, Christianity was first made known in Scotland, is not easy to determine ; as the Avant of ancient Records of the Scottish Church renders it difficult to throw any light upon this subject. But, it has been thought not improbable, that Christianity prevailed in North Britain in the Third and Fourth Centuries .<+ and, in 565, we have seen that it was established by St. Columba. It was by sIoav degrees, that the Church of Rome was introduced into this Kingdom. Some few Popish customs were adopted in the Eighth Century. But, in the Eleventh Century, one Diocesan Bishop (of St. AndreAv's), who was designated *' Episcopus Scoti\u00e6 or Scotorum,\" and numerous Monks and Friars were introduced ; and, in the Twelfth Century, in the reign of King David the First, the Popish Clergy and their Doctrines had obtained a secure sooting. % The privileges of the Scottish Church are often confirmed in the Statutes, but are no where precisely enumerated. They seem to have been an exemption from tribute and war, and from the sentence of a Temporal Judge : \u2014 a Judicial author ity in the Spiritual causes of Tythes, Testaments, Matrimonial and Heretical affairs : \u2014 freedom to let lands, and tythes : \u2014 submission to no foreign Church, the Pope alone : and, a power of holding Provincial Councils for the regulation * Chalmers's Caledonia, vol. 1. p. 616, note.

In Benefices, the Pontiff had only the right of confirm ation and deprivation, and the purchase of any Benefice at Rome was strictly prohibited. The Bishops were elected by the Chapter, and the Royal recom mendation seems seldom to have interfered. Abbots were chosen by the Monks alone ; the Secular Clergy were named by the Proprietors ofthe Lands. These Clergy were either Rectors, or Vicars*, many were in the appointment of the Bishops, and of Collegiate Bodies, whose Chapters they formed : hence the Lay Patronage was much confined. It appears, from the Foundation Charter ofthe Collegiate Church of Dunbar, that a Vicar's Salary was about Ten merks Ster ling, or about \u00a370. of modern currency.* As the Court of Rome contrived to draw immense sums, under various pre tences, from the Kingdom, a prudent Statute was enacted in 1471, in the reign of James the Third, which provides against the encroachments of the Roman Church, now arising to such enormity, as, in half a Century afterwards, pro voked the Reformation, by prohibiting the Clergy, under pain of Treason, to procure any Benefices from the Court of Rome, not formally holden by the Pope's disposal ; or to collect more money for the Papal treasury, than had been regu lated by the ancient Taxation of Bagimont A\" According to Lord Hailes, the mission of Bagimont into Scotland was inthe year 1275 ; who says, ** Benemundus de Vicci,\" vulgarly called Bagimont, was employed by the Pope to collect the Tenth of all Ecclesiastical Benefices in Scotland, for the relief of The Holy Land. % Mr. Chalmers adds, that his real name Avas Bayamond, and that he held an Ecclesiastical Council at Perth ; when, the Avhole Clergy, except the Cistertians, who enjoyed their exemptions, agreed to pay the Tenth of their Benefices, upon Oath, and under the terrors of Excommunication. \" The Auld Taxation of Bagimont\" is often referred to, by the Scottish Statutes, as an adequate measure of the true value of Ecclesiastical Benefices. In that age, the Clergy felt the oppression of paying truly one Tenth of their real incomes. And, they induced Bayamond to repair to Rome, in order to solicit some abatement of that burdensome imposition. But, Bayamond, without making any impression upon the accustomed avarice ofthe Papal Court, returned into Scotland, where his efforts were ineffectual in collecting the Tax, but where he ultimately found a Grave. \u00a7 * Pinkerton's Hist, of Scotland, vol. 1. p. 173.

The Reformation from Popery marks an Epoch unquestionably the most im portant in the history of Modern Europe. The effects of the change Avhich it produced in Religion, in Manners, in Politics, and in Literature, continue to be felt at the present day.* The corruptions, by which the Christian Religion Avas universally depraved, before the Reformation, had groAvn to a greater height in Scotland, than in any other Nation within the Pale of The Western Church. Superstition, and Reli gious imposture, in their grossest forms, gained an easy admission among a rude and ignorant people. By means of these, the Clergy attained to an exorbitant degree of opulence and power: Avhich Avere accompanied, as they always have been, Avith the corruption of their Order, and of the whole System of Religion. \"t\" This open and scandalous depravity of manners concurred to bring about the Reformation ; and, as almost all Scotland was ofthe Protestant Church, in 1560, the States employed the general poAver granted to them by the Queen, to estab lish the Reformation by Parliament. This was followed with an order to demolish all the Monasteries, which was immediately put in execution. 'X But the doctrine and worship of The Reformed Church had to encounter changes, as Presbytery, or Prelacy alternately prevailed in the Government of the Church. From the year 1560 to 1572, Presbytery was the established form. But, from the year 1572 to 1592, a sort of Episcopacy obtained in the Church. From 1592 to 1610, it was again strictly Presbyterian : But, in 1610, The General Assembly at Glasgow enacted, that Episcopacy should be the Govern ment of the Church, which was again condemned by a General Assembly, in 1638 : Avhen the exercise of Presbyterian Government was revived in full vigour, and the change was ratified in Parliament in 1641 ; and so continued, until the year 1662. The Government of the Church by Bishops was now restored, not by the Church, or the State, but by Tlie King's Prerogative Royal, and was* ratified in Parliament in 1662. But, on the 11th of April 1689, The Convention op Estates *' declared Prelacy a great and insupportable grievance to the Nation and that it ought to be abolished.\" In the year 1690, the Presbyterian Government was restored, and established * Preface to Macrie's Life of John Knox. p. 1. \u2022\"\u2022 Macrie's Life of John Knox. p . 14. % Rapin's Hist, of England, vol. 7. p. 229. 5th edit. 1760. 8vo."], [29, "PREFACE. XVII by Parliament; and, in the same year, The General Assembly met, after it had been discontinued ever since the year 1652. The Episcopal Ministers now conformed generally to the Civil Government, and were indulged to keep their Churches and Benefices during life ;* except in the West and South parts of Scotland, where they were violently ejected, aud, in some instances, treated with barbarity. It Avill be observed, that the Author has constantly given to each Benefice the Appellation of Rectory, Vicarage, or Chaplainry, a designation which is disused by the present Presbyterian Ministers. He has been enabled to denote this cir cumstance from a copy of Bagimont's Roll, which was specially procured for him from The Advocate's Library, by the kindness of Mr. Napier ; and he was induced, independent of the great worth and curiosity of that Roll, to preserve the distinction in compliance with History, and the several Learned Writers, who, in treating of Ecclesiastical affairs, have studiously retained those titles. In his further Apology for introducing the Appellation, he remarks, that frequent mention of allowance for \" Vicarage\" is made by the Ministers themselves in The Statistical Account, which would seem to render it consistent : And, in their more formal Returns to The Teind Court, so late as the year 1812, the claims of*' Vicarage,\" and '* Vicarage Teind\" are repeatedly enumerated. On the final establishment of The Presbyterian Church, the Benefices were so poor, that few persons of education would dedicate themselves to The Ministry. \"V Various circumstances had co-operated to occasion this diminution in the property of the Church : Before the demise of James the Fifth, the Abbots, and Bishops, adopted the practice of relinquishing some of their privileges, and property, to some powerful Baron, to protect their rights against violence, by bonds of Man-Rent ;X aud, in March 1596, it was calculated that, of the Nine Hundred Churches in Scotland, there were then Four Hundred without Minis ters, or Readers ; that is, at the end of Forty years, after The Reformation begun :\u00a7 the whole Estates ofthe ancient Church, having been appropriated by The Nobles, before any Establishment could be made for The Reformed Clergy.|| In 1617, an attempt Avas made to give permanent relief to \" the Ministery, * Shaw's Moray./.. 293. et passim. + Shaw's Moray, p. 304.

But, this Authority soon expired, Avithout being able to accomplish its purposes.

X From The Union in 1707, to 1738, there appear to have been no augmenta tions. The first application for a second Augmentation was made in 1742 ; and Fifty-three augmentations Avere soon after applied for, and obtained. The year 1750 may be deemed the late commencement of the Prosperity of Scotland ; and, the Augmentation of the Ministers' Stipends kept pace Avith the gradual advance of every Order in the State. \u00a7 The recent practice of augmenting Stipends, and adjusting claims, partly in money, and partly in victual, according to the circumstances of the Paro chial products, has somewhat tended to mitigate the pressure arising from the depreciation of money, and the alteration of prices, and of manners.

This Act seems to have been a sort of compromise, between the Landholders, who were to pay the frequent augmentations, and the Clergy, who were to receive them.* The subject was, therefore, soon revived: and, on the 15th of June 1810, an Act was passed \" for augmenting Parochial Stipends, in certain cases, in Scot- land.\" The Preamble, on reciting the Scotch Acts respecting Teinds in 1633, proceeds to state, that, \" Avhereas in many Parishes in Scotland, where the Stipends of the Parochial Ministers are payable out of the Teinds or Tythes, in consequence of the depreciation of the value of money, the Stipends of such Parochial Ministers have become inadequate to their support and maintenance, and on account ofthe valuations of Teinds which have taken place, no Funds exist out of Avhich future Augmentations of such Stipends can be granted : \u2014 And whereas in several Parishes where the Stipends ofthe Parochial Ministers are payable out of Funds and Revenues separate and distinct from the Teinds, such Stipends have also become inadequate to the support and mainenance of the Ministers thereof, and no Funds exist out of which such Stipends can be augmented ; \u2014 And whereas it is expedient, that means should be provided for augmenting the Stipends of each of such Ministers as aforesaid, to a yearly amount or value of One Hundred and Fifty Pounds Sterling, and it appears that an annual Sum, not exceeding \u00a310,000. Sterling, will be sufficient to carry these purposes into effect :\" \u2014 it Avas, therefore, enacted, \" That, from and after the passing of this Act, there shall in every year be set apart and appropriated in the hands of His Majesty's Receiver General and Paymaster in Scotland out ofthe Public Revenues and Money received and collected by him, an annual sum, not exceeding in the whole the Sum of \u00a310,000. of lawful money of Great Britain, to answer the purposes ofthis Act.\" * Chalmers's Caledonia, vol. 2. p. 25. note. c 2"], [32, "PREFACE. XX And, in consequence, several ofthe Clerks to the different Presbyteries having transmitted their accounts, as required by the Act, to the principal Clerk to Tiie Lords of Council and Session, as Commissioners for Plantation of Kirks and Valuation of Teinds, Schedules were drawn up and published under their direction and authority, containing Six different Lists, corresponding to the various descriptions of Claims : \u2014 No. I. containing those Stipends, where the Teinds are all valued and exhausted. No. IL containing those Stipends, where the Teinds are all valued, but where certain portions of Teinds remain unexhausted. No. III. containing those Stipends, which exceed the amount of the valued Teind. No. IV. containing those Stipends, where the Teinds are not all valued, and the amount ofthe Teind for augmentation is uncertain. No. V. containing those Stipends, where no valuations appear at all. No. VI. containing those Stipends, which do not arise from Teinds, or where the Teinds form only a small part of them. On the 22d of January 1811, the first two Lists were disposed of by their Lordships. And, on the 15th of February 1812, aMinutefor The Procurator of The Church of Scotland was given in, craving that their Lordships would now dispose ofthe Claims contained in the four remaining Lists. For the acquisition of those Lists, the Author is indebted to James MiLLER,Esq., ofthe Teind Office, and by whose peculiar courtesy and liberality the obligation is considerably enhanced.

The present condition of the Churches, and manses, are likewise subjoined: these are necessarily subject to the injuries of time: But, it is generally to the Honour of the Nation, that decency and propriety are the dis tinguishing characters of their Churches, and that comfort and convenience mark the residence of their Ministers.

By an insertion of the Results of those tAvo National Investigations, an imme diate view is presented ofthe increase or diminution of the Resident Population in every Parish, during an interval of Ten years. The Resident Population of Scotland, in so far as any inference can be drawn from the Ninety-nine Registers returned from thence in 1801, and including the usual proportion of the Army and Navy, appears to have been about One Million in the year 1700,\u2014 Fourteen Hundred Thousand, in 1750,\u2014 Sixteen Hundred and Fifty Thousand, in 1801, \u2014 and, in 1811, was Eighteen Hundred and Si*_ty Thousand Persons. t In these Volumes a perfect uniformity with those of England will not be found to prevail, particularly in that kind of Information which arises from the legal Provision for the Maintenance ofthe Poor. In Scotland, as in England, the Poor avIio had formerly received their principal support from the Religious Houses were, on their suppression, left entirely destitute, and many of them must of course have suffered severely. Hence arose the t.vo famous Acts ofthe 14\u00b0 (1571) and the 43* (1600) of Elizabeth, for the establishment of Poors' Rates. As it happened, that Alms-giving, at the Church doors was considered * Johnson's Journey to the Western Islands, p. 34. edit. 1775.

Many crude Laws were indeed enacted, but so evidently inadequate for the purpose, that they were not, at that time, attempted to be carried into effect. In 1579, there was an Act, evidently borrowed from that of Elizabeth in 1571 ; Avhich being found inadequate, another Act, in 1592, was passed, putting the power of enforcing the Law into the hands ofthe Sheriff of each County. This expedient, hoAvever, having likewise failed, the Act of 1597 ordains the power to be granted to the Kirk Session. This coinciding more with the manners and ideas ofthe times, has been most generally adhered to, and The Kirk Sessions have esteemed it a most important trust. They have very honourably and judiciously, therefore, regarded it as their duty, to be perfectly Avell acquainted with the situation and character of those Avho apply for relief, and have assisted them in proportion, from the collections made at the Church-doors, and other small dues payable to the Session : which have been, for the most part, found sufficient for the purpose. It is believed , that none of the crude Acts relating to the Poor, were ever attempted to be carried into execution prior to the year 1740. The inclemency of the weather, and the scarcity that consequently succeeded, brought dreadful sufferings upon the Poor : which circumstance induced some beneAolent, but ill-advised persons, in particular Parishes of a few ofthe Southern Shires in Scot land, in order to oblige absent Heritors to contribute their quota toAvards assist ing the Poor in their uncommon distress, to seek for, and actually to get imposed, a Poor's Rate on the inhabitants, under these supposed Acts, Avhich were ac quiesced in. These Parishes and some others near the Borders of England, are now annually assessed : which impolitic innovation has brought on some dis putes about settlements, and other disagreeable circumstances ever attendant on Poor's Rates. Applications from Paupers to the Sheriffs of these Counties are daily increasing; and the Sheriffs have found little difficulty in giving their decrees, although the various Statutes clash with each other in almost all the material circumstances. Of late some Sheriffs have stepped over all bounds and have taken upon themselves not only to order Paupers to be admitted upon the Poor's Roll of particular Parishes, but even have decreed the quantum of aliment to be paid to them : although this conduct is directly contrary to the"], [35, "PREFACE. XXIII supposed Laws relating to the Poor, and the clear Opinion delivered by several ofthe Judges of The Court of Session from the Bench, \" That Sheriffs have no \" power to order what money should be given to a Pauper, as the matter of dis \" tribution dejnre, as well as from expediency, belongs to the Heritors and Kirk \" Session.\" Great praise is, therefore, given to Dr. James Anderson, for his spirited re sistance against the Assessment which was attempted to be imposed in the Parish of South Leith. His motives Avere truly patriotic ; and he might justly pride himself, on \" leaving* the investigation ofthe Poor Laws of Scotland as a \" legacy to his Countrymen, that when he was gone, it might remain as. a \" Memorial that he had not lived in vain.\"* The members of the Episcopal Congregation support their own Poor. The Map which has been used for ascertaining the Distances and Bearings, is Arrowsmith's Map of Scotland, which was published in 1807. As this Map is very deservedly of esteemed value, and was published by His Majesty's Gracious Permission, it is highly gratifying to deduce its origin from the Report of The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, in August, 1807, p. 29. \" The inconvenience to which We were subjected by the Avant of an accurate Map of Scotland, caused us to inquire into the practicability of remedy ing the defect ; and in this We have succeeded beyond our expectations, as it Avas discovered, that His Majesty's Library contained an original Survey of the Avhole of the Main-land of Scotland. \" This Survey was commenced in the year 1747, under the direction of Colonel, afterwards Lieutenant General Watson, then Quarter Master General of Scotland, and carried on principally by General Roy, assisted by several Officers of the Engineers, each of whom surveyed the Districts allotted to him. They first surveyed The Highlands ; and, in 1752, it was determined to extend the Survey to the Southern part of Scotland. In 1754, the whole was finished, with the exception of The Isles^ and of some very inconsiderable spots in The Highlands. \" Many years afterwards, His Majesty granted permission to General Roy to publish from the Survey (which is on a Scale of nearly two Inches to a mile) * Agricultural Report of the Shire of Clackmannan, pp. 86, et passim, by John Francis Erskine, Esq. ; and Agricultural Report ofthe Shire of Roxburgh, p. 86, by The Rev. David Ure."], [36, "PREFACE. XXIV an improved Map of Scotland ; but, after collecting such Astronomical obser vations as might serve to bound and verify the Survey, General Roy suspended his intention, and never aftenvards resumed it. \" The Survey having proceeded from small beginnings, is not strictly Trigo nometrical, but depending chiefly on the Magnetic Meridian, which experience has demonstrated to be peculiarly various in different parts of Scotland ; and General Roy must have found it very difficult in the then scarcity of known posi tions and authentic Charts of the Coast, to have combined the various uncon nected parts ofthe Survey, in a manner AA'orthy of such a laborious and accurate Work. These difficulties, however, have been since in a great degree overcome, and, We have reason to believe, that no labour has been spared in procuring information for the adjustment and improvement ofthe Map. \". Having obtained His Majesty's Gracious Permission, We employed Mr. Arrowsmith, as being a Geographer of high reputation, to copy and reduce the original Sun'ey. The Astronomical observations said to have been collected by General Roy, have not been found ; and, in order to render the Map correct and complete in every respect, it has become necessary for Mr. Arrowsmith to form an extensive collection of neAV materials, to which we have contributed our best endeavours by consulting Mr. Playfair, Professor inThe University of Edin burgh, Mr. Jackson, of Ayr, and several other scientific persons of eminence, in order to supply some ofthe most important particulars. **\u2022* The Map, which Mr. Arrowsmith has produced after two years labour, has received an Unanimous testimony of its accuracy from all persons acquainted with the various parts of Scotland. It has been of singular advantage to the beauty ofthis Map, that Mr. Paul Sandby (lately dead), who has since become so well known for his talents as an Artist, was employed in making the ori ginal fair copy, and especially in delineating all the Mountains and broken ground of The Highlands ; and this advantage has not been neglected in the reduced Map.\" Scotland, with its Islands, is about equal to Ireland in area, and is half as large as England and Wales. But, in computing the area of Scotland in English square miles, it is right to mention, that the Scotish mile is 5,952 Eng lish feet, or, compared with the English mile, as 9 to 8 : \u2014 But it is rapidly fall ing into disuse.* * Mr. Rickman's Preliminary observations to the Population Abstract, in 1811. p. xxx."], [37, "PREFACE.

The Markets, and Fairs, are taken generally from the best books of Topogra phy : As is also the State of each Corporate Body, together with the Statement of the Royal Burghs, and the Contributary Members, in their Representative capacity. A variety of Historical information, subjects of Antiquity, and peculiar Cus toms are introduced. And those who justly boast the pride of Ancestry, will find the several names of their great Baronial Castles, and of their paternal Es tates, faithfully recorded. In a country where the rights of Ceremony are so tenaciously observed, such notice, although it might extend the size of the Volumes, seemed to be indispensable. \" Where Races are thus numerous, and thus combined,\" says Dr. Johnson, \" none but the Chief ofa Clan is ad dressed by his name. The Laird of Dunvegan is called Macleod, but other Gentlemen ofthe same Family are denominated by the places where they reside, as Raasay, or Talisker. The distinction ofthe meaner people is made by their Christian names. In consequence ofthis practice, the late Laird of Macfarlane, an eminent Genealogist, considered himself as disrespectfully treated, if the common addition Avas applied to him. Mr. Macfarlane, said he, may with equal propriety be said to many ; but I, and I only am Macfarlane.\"* The practice of calling Gentlemen by the name of their possessions, is, how ever, not confined solely to Scotland. The same custom prevailed in The Island of Jersey, where Gentlemen who had Seigneuries or Fiefs, were usually styled by the names of them. Thus Sir Charles de Carteret, Seigneur of St. Ouen, was denominated Monsieur de St. Ouen, and, in like manner, Avere the other ancient families.*!* And in France, it is well known, that the practice is still prevalent. To add to the information contained under the several Parishes, the magni tude of each is described ; and a brief notice is taken of the quality of the soil, and the present state of Agriculture.

From the mode of farming, and the manner in which the Avork is conducted, a stranger might conclude that, in point of activity and address, the Agriculturists here are inferior to those in more fortunate situations. This, however, is not the case ; causes exist sufficient to resist the exertions of the most intelligent and enterprising characters. The plans of the Farmer, and the manner of execution, are such as necessity alone, not choice, could possibly dictate. The climate, though not unhealthy, is ungenial and late, and is often injurious to the crops. The fields are, in general, hilly, and difficult to cultivate. Markets, and manure, are distant : and the roads, which are, in many parts, ab- rupt, are often rendered impassable by the torrents of rain that deluge the country at particular seasons. But, above all, the ardour of industrious enterprize is most chilled, by the manner in which the Tenants hold their leases, especially in the Shire of Forfar ; these are in general, Life Renters, or, in other Avords, the dur- ation of their Lease depends upon the life ofa single individual, avIio is chosen at pleasure. Whatever is, therefore, expended on improvements, more than is deemed to be absolutely necessary, the Tenants consider as so much lost to themselves and their families ; as the hope of advantage expires Avith the person on Avhose life their Lease depended.* Some amelioration is, however, obtained by the Act of 1633. cap. 17. ; by Avhich Titulars are obliged to value and sell their Teinds to the Heritors or Landholders, at nine years purchase, Avhen legally required. And in Parishes where there is no Titular, the Patrons are obliged by the* Acts of 1690 and 1693, to sell their Teinds to the Heritors at six years purchase, excepting in those Parishes where the Crown is Titular or Patron, in Avhich they can be valued and let in lease, but cannot be sold. If Titulars, and Patrons, had not been obliged by law thus to value and sell their Teinds, all the efforts of the Legislature, of Patriotic Societies and of Individuals, to encourage Agriculture in Scotland, would be in vain. What man of sense would improve his estate at a great expense, when the Titular or Patron Avould carry off, annually, the fifth part of his increased Rent ?T All this reasoning applies with equal force to Thirlage, as a bar to improve ment ofland; Avith this single difference, that Teinds affected all the lands of Scotland, and Tliirlage only some of them. These considerations ought to Aveigh * From the information of the present worthy Minister of Lethnot, in Forfar. t Agricultural Report for Dumfries, p. 95., by Bryce Johnston, D.

To remove this evil, in a way the most equitable and fair for all parties, and most beneficial for the country at large, The Rev. Dr. Johnston proposes, that an Act of Parliament should be passed, empowering the landholders to compel the proprietors and tenants of the Mills to value their multures, knaveship, and other dues; and, if they shall require it, to sell them at Sixteen years purchase.* Customs, and Personal Services, (the remnant of ancient Villenage), are also noticed in this Work ; but the whole catalogue of them is so adverse to agricul ture, and to the true interests of the Proprietors, that, by many liberal and enlightened persons, they have long been abolished ; and, in a short time, it is hoped, that their very names will be obsolete, and the nature of them be totally forgotten. Scotland has derived many solid advantages from Acts of the Legislature. Even the wild and terrible consequences of Rebellion have been converted into Public good. By the Report of The Committee on the Funds arising from The Forfeited Estates in Scotland, on the 16th of June 1806, it appears, that, in the year 1745, the adherents of The House of Stuart made their last attempt to place that Family upon the Throne of these Kingdoms. When the Rebellion, which they had raised, was quelled by the decisive Victory of Cullo den, the attention of Government was directed to the best means of preventing in future the return of internal disorders, by which the Public at large, as well as the Districts Avhere they prevailed, had suffered considerably. Among the measures adopted for that purpose, it was resolved, in the first place, to vest in the CroAvn the Estates of those who had been attainted, in consequence of their having engaged in that Rebellion. *f And, afterwards, these Estates were un alienably annexed to the Crown, and the Rents and Profits thereof were directed to be applied \" for the better civilizing and improving The Highlands of Scot land, and preventing disorders there for the future. \"X * Agricultural Report for the Shire of Dumfries, p. 96.

II. c. 41., by which they had been unalienably annexed to the Cro .vn. Among the conditions to Avhich the Restoration of these Estates was made subject, the principal was the re-payment of certain sums paid by the Public on account of the Debts due by the persons whose Estates had been forfeited, amounting in the whole to \u00a390,214.. 12.. 5. His Majesty Avas also authorized to grant the Superiority of certain Estates to The Dukes of Argyle and Athol, on the payment of certain sums into the Exchequer, to the amount of \u00a33248.. 16.4. Out of any payments thence arising all engagements entered into by the Board of Annexed Estates Avere to be defrayed. The Rents arising from these Estates having been unalienably appropriated to public purposes in Scotland, it necessarily followed, that any sums arising from the Restoration thereof, should be applied to the same objects. Hence, by the disannexing Act, \u00a315,000. was granted for completing a Repository for the Records of Scotland, and \u00a350,000. for completing The Forth and Clyde Navigation. By the same Act, \" the Balance of Money so to be paid in, Avas to remain under the care of The Court of Exchequer in Scotland, subject to the future disposition of Parliament.\" It appears that, out ofthe said Balance, several additional sums were granted by successive Acts of Parliament, for Public purposes in Scotland : viz., \u00a32000. to The Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge : \u00a33000. to The Highland Society of Scotland ; \u00a31000. to building a Gaol at Inverness ; and \u00a31000. for building a Bridge over the Peese or Pass of Cockburn's Path, in the Shire of Benvick. By these various Grants the Balance at the disposal of Parliament Avould have been considerably reduced, had not The Forth and Clyde Navigation repaid the \u00a350,000. which it had borrowed from the Fund. In consequence of that payment, Parliament Avas enabled to lend that sum for promoting two important public Undertakings, viz., ,\u00a325,000. to The Proprietors of The Crinan Canal, * 24\u00b0 Geo.

Upon ascertaining the state ofthis Fund, The Committee Avere naturally led to inquire, to Avhat useful purposes in Scotland the same could be applied ; and they had the satisfaction of stating to The House of Commons, that by a proper distribution of the Capital, and the Interest upon it, a number of most important Public objects might be obtained, which they were satisfied would prove of infinite advantage to that part of The United Kingdom. Among the objects recom mended Avere, The improA*ement ofthe British Fisheries. \u2014 The promoting of Agricultural and other improvements, \u2014 The construction of Harbours on dif ferent parts ofthe Coast of Scotland, \u2014 and, Canals. In the year 1786, a number of respectable individuals constituted themselves into a Society '. for extending the Fisheries and improving the Sea Coasts ofthe Kingdom ; and were Incorporated by an Act of Parliament passed for that spe cial purpose.* The attention of The Society was first directed to the West ern parts of Scotland, where they have established three distinct Settlements, at Ullapool, Tobermory, and Stein. They afterwards became desirous of forming ano ther Settlement on the Eastern coast; and after due examination, they found in the neighbourhood of Wick a situation eminently calculated for the extension of the Fisheries, and which has recently been rendered amply commodious by the erection ofa new Bridge. So that this patriotic Institution, Avhose objects are of the highest National importance, are now prosecuted with increased success. In 1784, originated another most respectable and useful Institution, known under the name of The Highland Society of Scotland. This Society has in various respects been of material Public service. Besides rousing, by means of its Premiums, a spirit of improvement in the remotest Districts of The Highlands, it has ever stood forward in suggesting useful regulations, and in promoting any measures, calculated for the general interests ofthe Country, which the peculiar exigences of the times might require. The important objects Avhich it has in contemplation, are not restricted to The Highlands alone, but are extended to the improvement of Scotland in general, and it has at length become a National Agricultural Society.

XXX Parliamentary Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, and The Commissioners for The Caledonian Canal. In the Autumn ofthe year 1802, a Survey and Report of the Coasts and Cen tral Highlands of Scotland was made by the Command of The Right Honour able The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, by Thomas Tel ford, Esq., Civil Engineer, and which Avas ordered to be printed on the 5th of April 1803. By this Report, ( p. 4.) it appears, that previous to the year 1742, the Roads in the North of Scotland Avere merely the tracks of Black cattle and horses, in tersected by numerous rapid streams, .vhich, being frequently swoln into torrents by heavy rains, rendered them dangerous or impassable. The Military Roads Avhich were formed about this time, having been laid out Avith other views than promoting commerce and industry, are generally in such directions, and so incon veniently steep, as to be nearly unfit for the purposes of civil life ; and in those parts where they are tolerably well directed , or Avhere Roads have since been formed by the Inhabitants, the use of them is very much circumscribed from the Avant of Bridges over some ofthe principal Rivers. Mr. Telford's Report Avas referred to a Committee, the most active Mem bers ofwhich were Nicholas Vansittart, Esq., then Secretary ofthe Treasury, John Hawkins Broaane, Esq., and William Smith, Esq., Avell known for his affection to Scotland. This Committee, in a Report to The House of Com mons, which was ordered to be printed on the 3d of June 1803, observe ( p. 18.) they are sensible, that Bridges cannot be built, or lines of road formed through this mountainous and difficult country, Avithout the aid of Public liberality and encouragement : the first and original expense of such Avorks, it is in vain to ex pect that the means of the Proprietors of land can altogether defray ; but it seems just that the land owners should assist the Public to the extent of their ability ; and, for that purpose, it may be expedient to afford every facility for enabling them to raise such sums of money as may be necessary, as they will share the general benefit which must result from diffusing habits of industry among the people, and opening a free and ready access to the more cultivated part of the country. It, therefore, appeared to The Committee to be adviseable, That provision should be made by Parliament, for defraying one-half of the estimated expense of the Roads and Bridges, which may appear most immediately necessary : \u2014 That the remainder ofthe expense of making such Roads and Bridges should"], [43, "PREFACE. XXXI be defrayed by the Proprietors of land, or other persons who may be benefited thereby ; and that provision should be made for keeping such Roads and Bridges in proper repair : \u2014 And, that, in order to provide for the proper expenditure of the Public money, and that the said Roads and Bridges may be carried on with prudence and eco nomy, it seemed proper that Commissioners should be appointed to superintend and direct the execution ofthe same. Accordingly, on the 4th of July 1803, an Act received the Royal Assent, by which Commissioners were appointed to superintend the distribution of Public aid granted towards improving the interior of The Highlands of Scotland, and which Avas intituled, \" An Act for granting to His Majesty the sum of Twenty Thousand Pounds, to be issued and applied towards making Roads and build ing Bridges in The Highlands of Scotland ; and for enabling the Proprietors ofland in Scotland to charge their Estates with a proportion ofthe expense of making and keeping in repair, Roads and Bridges in The Highlands of Scotland.\" These Commissioners proceeded with great zeal and judgment in the execu tion of the important Trust confided to their care, so that numerous Roads and Bridges of great Public utility were completed under their auspices ; and, in their Fifth Report of April 1811 {p. 22), they state, that the limitation of appli cations for Public aid towards Highland Roads and Bridges having taken place on the 4th of July 1810, a Public Advertisement to that effect was repeatedly inserted in all the Scottish Newspapers during the Summer of 1809 : this Ad vertisement produced se\\*eral applications, of which most of those worthy of notice appear in their Report : But it is not to be forgotten, that the Roads spe cified in the several County Assessment Acts ofthe Shires of Ross, Sutherland, and Caithness, are not excluded by the Limitation above mentioned, they hav ino* in reality a previous claim to attention. The Commissioners having gone through all that appears worthy of the no tice of Parliament, now advert to a subject of not less importance ; that is to say, the maintenance of those Roads and Bridges in good repair. With this view an Act was passed in the 50\u00b0 Geo. III. c. 43., intituled \" An Act for maintaining and keeping in repair Roads made and Bridges built in Scotland, under the authority of The Parliamentary Commissioners for High land Roads and Bridges.\" Upon which The Commissioners observe, \" We think that we may reasonably congratulate the Proprietors and the other Inhab-"], [44, "PREFACE. XXXII itants of The Highlands on a Legislative enactment, which will ensure to them and to the Public the lasting benefit of those advantages, which have been conferred Avith such unprecedented liberality.\" By this Act, the several Roads and Bridges are to be placed each under a Committee, appointed by The County Commissioners of Supply, and in case the necessary repairs shall not be effected by their superintendance and authority, any individual Heritor may by summary process compel the County or the par ticular District, as the case may be, to levy an Assessment for the repair of such Road or Bridge. By the completion of particular Bridges, the communication of the great Highland Road Avithout the intervention of any Ferry is effected, quite to the Northern extremity of Great Britain ; the Bridges of Dunkeld, Lovat, Conan; and Bonar, forming a connected series of Bridges, which for size, solidity, and utility, is not surpassed any where in the Kingdom.

The expense to the Public, up to February 1813, appears to have been nearly \u00a3120,000., and an equal sum has been raised by the Contributions of Individuals aud County Assessment Acts. This new test of expediency, that of granting aid only to those who meet it Avith a similar exertion of their own, seems to have ansAvered extremely well in practice, \u2014 The Commissioners remarking, that they have seldom had occasion to regret the Avant of offers of Contribution, nor, on the other hand, have they often been under the necessity of rejecting any application for a Road, as defective in utility ;\u2014 so that, generally speaking, the Roads actually made, and intended to be made, may be deemed those most beneficial to the Country at lar\u00b0\"e."], [45, "PREFACE. XXXIII And The Highlands of Scotland may be congratulated in having been the fortunate object ofthis successful experiment in Political Oeconoofy. The Committee, to whom Mr. Telford's Survey and Report of the Coasts and Central Highlands of Scotland Avas referred, in their Third Report, which was ordered to be printed on the 14th of June, 1803, observe {p. 23), that they have proceeded to the consideration of that part of Mr. Telford's Survey which relates to forming an Inland Navigation from the Eastern to the Western Sea, by Inverness and Fort William ; and have now received all the Evidence they think necessary to enable them to form an opinion upon this subject. \" Your Committee,\" they continue, \" being aware of the importance ofthis great National object, have, with much care, examined sundry experienced and respectable Shipmasters, with regard to the present Navigation by The Pentland Firth, Cape Wrath, and The Minch, to the Irish Channel : From the testimony of several persons long experienced in this Navigation, it appears to Your Committee, that this Navigation, so far as regards the Commercial inter course between the Western and Eastern coasts of Great Britain, or between a considerable part of Ireland and the Eastern coasts of Great Britain, or between a considerable part of Ireland and the Northern parts of Europe ; or between the Western coast of Great Britain and the same Countries, by the Pentland Firth, is not only very circuitous ; but, during the Autumn and Winter, especially in long nights, on account of the thickness of the Weather, the violence of the waves, the rapidity and diversity ofthe Tides, is peculiarly difficult and danger ous. It appears, however, to Your Committee, that some difference of opinion prevails, as to the extent of that danger ; for Captains Huddart and Fraser, whose authority must in all cases have great weight, seem not to think it very considerable. But the contrary opinion is entertained by all those who have had personal experience of that Navigation, and is supported by the acknow ledged facts of frequent and distressing losses of property to a large amount, and of many valuable lives. \" Your Committee having also examined, with much attention, sundry expe rienced Mariners and Civil Engineers, as well as Captain Gwynn, the Com mander of the Government Galley on Loch Ness, a man of Thirty-seven years experience in that service, as to the practicability of forming The Canal, and navigating both that and all the Lochs between Inverness and Fort William with ships of burden ; and likewise as to the difference of time and safety in passing through this Navigation, when compared with that by The Pentland vol. i. e"], [46, "xx xiv PREFACE. Firth, Cape Wrath, and TheMinch; Your Committee find, that the Navigation ofthe Moray Firth from Buchan-Ness to Fort George is very safe, has favourable tides, a spacious and commodious harbour in the Bay of Cromarty on the North- West side ofthe Moray Firth, and a tolerably good one at Burgh-Head on the South side thereof: \u2014 That, betAveen Fort George and Inverness, there is a Loch of safe Navigation and good Anchorage ; from Inverness to the North-East end of Loch Ness, a distance of about 7 miles, that the ground is favourable for a Canal ; and that Loch Ness, which is about 22 miles in length, and from one to two and a half in breadth, is of great depth of Avater, and quite free in its channel from rocks or impediments to the Navigation ; that there are six anchoring places on the North, and three on the South side thereof, besides excellent anchoring ground at each end ; that it never freezes ; and, though subject to occasional gusts ofAvind, yet they are not sufficiently violent to be dangerous, except from the end of November to the beginning of February ; \u2014From Loch Ness to Loch Oich, a distance of about 5 miles, the ground is very favourable for making a Canal ; \u2014 Loch Oich, Avhich is on the summit level between the East and West Seas, is only about 100 feet above the level of High-water mark ; it is about 4 miles in length, and receives the waters from Loch Garry, Loch Quoich, and all the Valley of Glen Garry and Glen Quoich, affording a supply of water beyond every possible demand ; Loch Oich is narrow, being only from one quarter to three quarters ofa mile in breadth, and is calculated to be navi gated by means of tracking, in the manner ofa Canal ; \u2014 From Loch Oich there is only a distance of one mile and a half of ground to the North-East end of Loch Lochy ; and this ground is also favourable for making a Canal ; the North- East end of Loch Lochy is peculiarly well formed, as an entrance bason, being separated from the body cf the Loch by a narrow Channel, in which is a suffi cient depth of Avater and good anchorage ; Loch Lochy is about 10| miles long, and from one and a half to two miles in breadth ; it is quite clear of rocks, and has good anchorage at each end, and also good anchorage near to the middle of the South side at Letter Findlay ; \u2014 The Waters of Loch Arkegg fall into the North Side ; \u2014 The surface of Loch Lochy is about 20 feet below that of Loch Oich, and about 80 feet above High-Water mark at Fort William ; \u2014 From the South-West end of Loch Lochy to the shore of Loch EU, which is an arm ofthe Western Sea, the distance is about 7 miles ; a road might readily be formed along the South side of Loch Lochy, and vessels might be tracked in calms, or against light breezes ; \u2014 BetAveen Loch Lochy and Loch EU, the ground is more"], [47, "PREFACE. XXXV rugged than in the other districts ; but, consisting of small risings, the tops of which may be thrown into the vallies, is not unfavourable for a Canal ; and there is no appearance of rock, any where upon the surface, in the line of the pro posed Navigation. The entrance into the sea at Loch EU is at a place where there is good shelter and anchorage for any number of vessels of burden. From Fort William down the Linnhe Loch, until it becomes part of the main sea, between Oban and the South end of The Isle of Mull, the Navigation is clear, and the tides are favourable ; in the course of this Loch tliere is shelter and anchorage, and within a little ofthe extremity ofthe Linnhe Loch are the excel lent Harbours of Oban, and Tobermory. From Oban the Navigation lies Avithin the Islands, passes near the mouth of Loch Crinan to The Irish Channel, or through the Crinan Canal to the Firth of Clyde ; so that from the entrance of the Moray Firth on the East, to Tlie Mull of Cantyre on the West, there is no risk from Storms or an Enemy.\" The Committee add, they are, therefore deeply impressed with the imme diate necessity of employing the people of the Country in the execution of this great National Work ; which will excite a spirit, and introduce habits of industry ; and will most probably check the present rage for Emigration, and prevent its future progress. \u2014 And that they are equally convinced of the prac ticability, as ofthe importance ofthis Work. The Committee, therefore, from a full consideration of all the evidence laid before them, submit to The House of Commons their opinion, \" That the execu tion of The Inland Navigation, proposed in Mr. Telford's Survey, under all due regulations for the ceconomical expenditure of such monies as may be employed in this great Work, will be a measure highly conducive to the Prosperity and Happiness of that part of Scotland in which it is situate, and of great import ance to the general Interests of the whole United Kingdom.\" In consequence ofthis Report, Commissioners were appointed for carrying into execution the purposes of an Act, passed in the 43\u00b0 Geo. III. intituled, \" An Act for granting to His Majesty the Sum of \u00a320,000., towards defraying the expense of making an Inland Navigation from the Eastern to the Western Sea, by Inverness and Fort William, and for taking the necessary steps toAvards executing the same.\" \u2014 And also, the purposes of an Act, passed in the 44\u00b0 Geo. III., intituled, \" An Act for making further provision for making and maintaining an Inland Navigation, commonly called The Caledonian Canal, from the Eastern to the Western Sea, by Inverness and Fort William in Scot- land.\" V e2"], [48, "xxxvi PREFACE. A very considerable portion of this Great National Work is already finished, and it may reasonably be expected, that a free intercourse between the German and Atlantic Oceans will be effected in about Five years from the present time (1813), and ultimately confirm the most ardent Wishes and Endeavours of the Patriotic Promoters and Managers of it. The expense of The Canal, up to June 1812, appears to have been about \u00a3400,000., and there would be no reason to expect that the original estimate of \u00a3\"500,000. would be much exceeded, had not the increasing price of labour and all commodities, since 1803, affected this Work in common with all others, so that \u00a3700,000. (if finally the cost should be so much) can scarcely be deemed a real exceeding ofthe Estimate. The annual Reports of The Commissioners, besides a detail of the progress of the Work, furnish a Diary of the Winds to settle the Question, as to the Current of air being constantly directed in the line of The Great Valley ; which, if true, would be the most serious impediment to the intended Naviga tion : But, this is proved to be an unfounded assertion, and the direction of the Wind to be as variable as elsewhere. The method, uniformly observed in the Reports of The Commissioners, may serve as a model on similar occasions. By means of a Monthly Table of the Number, and Employment of all the Workmen, specifying the places where they are respectively employed, a distinct view of the Monthly progress is given in a few pages ; \u2014 and, by classing the Expenditure into Ten heads judiciously chosen, no more than \u00a3600. remain unappropriated to some one of them, so that scarcely any question can occur to the curious inquirer, respecting the species and relative amount of expenditure in so great a Work, which will not find ready Answer by Inspection of an Account easy of comprehension, and not too long for immediate reference. In the mean time, the expected improvement in habits of industry has taken place among the Inhabitants of the Neighbourhood, and the Towns of Inver ness and Fort William exhibit unequivocal tokens of Prosperity. The scale of this National Canal, and consequently of its Locks, is unexampled, being calculated for the passage of large Frigates : Eight of those Locks being joined together near Fort William, form a mass of Masonry Six Hundred Yards in length. Many other particulars respecting this Canal well worthy of attention may be found in the annual Reports, which are already Nine in number: But, in"], [49, "PREFACE. XXXVII closing this concise description, the Author would be wanting in sincere regard not to mention, the great merit, assiduity, and judgment of the Secretary, John Rickman, Esq., whose well cultivated mind and inflexible integrity have been uniformly exerted, throughout both the last mentioned Commissions, with ample credit to himself, and with advantage to the Nation. It is matter of curiosity to add, that the ancient Map of Richard of Ciren cester, which is of the Fourteenth Century, exhibits a curious anticipation of The Caledonian Canal. Parochial Schools have prevailed in Scotland from a very remote period. Their Institution is to the Honour as well as the Utility of the Nation ; and they exhibit at once both the Wisdom and Patriotism of their Ancestors. As early as the reign of David the First, in 1124, Schools seem to have existed in the principal Towns of North Britain.* In the Fifth Parliament of James the Fourth it was enacted, under a penalty, that Barons, and Free-holders, should send their Eldest sons to the Schools, to learn Latin, and Law.\"*? By the estab lishment of these Schools, almost the whole common People in Scotland have been taught to read, and a very great proportion of them to write and ac compt.X But, although the patience, the abilities, and the good conduct ofthe School masters were exemplary, yet their legal Salaries were long inadequate to their merit : And it was matter of regret, that, as the Country increased in opulence and expense, the Salaries of this most useful class of Persons were permitted to remain stationary. On the 11th of June, 1803, an Act was, however, passed, \" for making better Provision for the Parochial Schoolmasters, and for making further Regulations for the better Government of the Parish Schools in Scotland :\" by which it is provided, that \" the Salary of each Parochial Schoolmaster in every Parish of Scotland shall not be under the sum of 300 merks Scots per annum, nor above the sum of 400 merks Scots per annum,\" together with a commodious House for a School, a House for the residence of the Schoolmaster, and a rood of land, Scotch measure. The Salaries so fixed, to be payable for Twenty-five years: after which, the Salaries to be ascertained and fixed, according \" to the average * Chalmers's Caledonia, vol. 1. p. 767. + Ibid, v. 1. p. 838. % Smith's Wealth of Nations, 10th edit. vol. 3. p. 187."], [50, "XXXVIII PREFACE price of a chalder of oat-meal for all Scotland :\" and, in like manner, the rate to be determined at the end of every T .venty-five years. And it is to the honour ofthe Heritors and Tenants, that they have almost invariably chosen to pay the maximum. Whilst in extensive Parishes, the Heritors are empowered to assess themselves in the sum of 600 merks, viz., 300 or 400 for the Parochial School, and the remainder for one or more Schools in remote Districts, from whence Children are unable to travel daily to the Parochial School. On the 8th of August 1807, an Act was passed \" for raising and securing a Fund for the relief of WidoAvs and Children of Burgh and Parochial School masters, in Scotland .*\" many of whom were often left in indigent circumstances. To the Fund therein ordained to be provided, every Parochial Schoolmaster, who is appointed after the date of this Act, is obliged to be a Contributor, in one ofthe five following Classes, viz., \" The Contributors to the first or highest Class shall be liable in the annual payment of the sum of \u00a35..5..0. ; those to the second Class, in the sum of \u00a34..4..0. ; those to the third Class, in the sum of \u00a33..3..0. ; those to the fourth Class, in the sum of \u00a32..2..0. ; and those to the fifth, or lowest Class, in the sum of \u00a3l..l. of lawful Money of Great Britain respectively ; it being optional to every Contributor to make choice of the Class to which he wishes to subject himself. And in consequence, it is enacted, that tliere shall be paid to the Widows of every Contributor to the first or highest Class, an Annuity of \u00a325. ; to those of the second Class, an Annuity of \u00a320. ; to those ofthe third Class, an Annuity of \u00a315. ; to those ofthe fourth Class, an Annuity of \u00a310. ; and to those ofthe fifth or lowest class, an Annuity of \u00a35. : \" which respective Annuities shall commence and be paid without deduction on the first day of September, which shall first happen one full half year after the death of such Contributor for the year preceding the said period, and the same shall continue to be paid on the said first day of September yearly, during the Annuitant's Life.\" The General Assembly of The Church of Scotland, sensible that the invaluable Blessings of a Religious life, and the happiness and permanent security of every well regulated Government, are chiefly founded in the early education of every class of the Community, have wisely appointed an annual Presbyterial visitation and examination of all the Schools in Scotland. By this judicious measure, considerable encouragement is given to the Teachers and Scholars, and the exertions of both of them are publicly excited. The Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge was established,"], [51, "PREFACE. xxxix principally, for communicating Religious instruction to The Highlanders, who speak the Gaelic language. Schools are established under their direction in the seAreral Parishes, where necessary: which are conducted with the strictest attention to moral rectitude, and the instillation of good principles into the minds ofthe Children. And to this laudable and pious Institution, the rapid progress of improvement in The Highlands may in a great measure be attributed.* On the celebration of their Anniversary in London, on Monday the 19th of March 1812, The Society in a gratifying manner observe, \" that the experience of more than a Century continues to exalt its worth, and draw out its benefits ; and that the favour and liberality of the Public towards it, increase with revolving years. On the Establishment of The Society there are at present about Three Hundred Schools planted in various Districts in The Highlands of Scotland : in which there are about Sixteen Thousand Children daily receiving religious education, and taught writing and arithmetic. In this extensive range of operations, The Society has been generously assisted by the Noble and wealthier Proprietors in those parts, and the education of the young is continually superintended by the Parochial Ministers in the vicinity ; from Avhom most minute and satisfactory Reports are annually re ceived by The Directors. The Children are instructed chiefly to read in the English language, which, amongst its other advantages, fits them for a more easy and a more perfect intercourse with every Quarter of The British Domi nions: but, at the same time, they are also taught to read in Gaelic, their native language, and to translate from English into Gaelic, the New Testament, Catechism, and Bible. The labours of those excellent men, who act as the School-masters, are often more various and important than at first sight they may appear : for, during those months, when the Highland Youth are generally employed in the occupations of the Fields ; these worthy men are engaged in expounding the Scriptures to the People on the Lord's Day, and catechising the neighbourhood at large : they are acting as Missionaries and Catechists to the Public, as well as Teachers to the Youth. Thus in their duty, prompt at every call, they teach and pray, they watch and feel for all. In short, by secur ing the assistance ofthe great Landholders, by engaging the watchful eye ofthe Parochial Ministers, and by employing at different times, the various talents of their Schoolmasters, The Society has been enabled under the Blessings of God, * Statistical Account, vol. 6. p. 153."], [52, "xl PREFACE. to pursue, at the smallest possible expense, their grand and beneficent plans, with a progress as uniform and steady, as their success has been conspicu ous and unexampled.\"* His Majesty with Parental kindness condescends to give \u00a31000. annually, for the similar purpose of Religious instruction ; to which His Royal Highness The Prince Regent most graciously adds \u00a31000. more ; and both of these Sums are under the management of The General Assembly. At an early period the great Barons possessed an arbitrary poAver over their Tenantry, which, in the dispute between Baliol and Bruce for the Sovereignty, was much increased. In the different wars afterwards, the Chieftains being further called upon to lead their followers into the field, necessarily contracted debts ; and from this \u00e6ra, the middle ranks of Society became worse ; for the Chiefs were obliged to impose an additional tax upon their yearly contributions, in order to defray the expenses incurred in attending* the Sovereign. This in- novation, in some measure, abated the ancient friendship between the Vassal sad the Chief; and, in order to enforce obedience, it was necessary to have re- course to Penal laws. The King accordingly gratified his Feudal Barons in this respect ; though indeed he could scarcely act otherAvise, for these haughty Chiefs were always formidable to his throne. Hence, the first daAvn of regal govern- ment produced gibbets upon almost every feudal estate ! Without trial or jury, the Proprietor exercised lawless passion without mercy or remorse. The evil became at length so flagrant, that a Jury and Bailiff or Sheriff was introduced : but the mischief was not cured ; for this LaAv-Officer was frequently venal as to the blood which he spared ; and, isa culprit Avas poor, he was usually esteemed a very proper subject for the Gallows. A system so despotic and tyrannical was endured with impatience ; but it was not effectually reformed, until the 25th of March 1747, when these Heritable Jurisdictions were abolished by a special Act of Parliament, passed for that purpose.*!* And this most salutary measure is considered, \" as one ofthe greatest National benefits that Scotland ever re- ceived, \u2014 of greater importance to her Prosperity and Well-being than even The Union ofthe Kingdom. \"X A List of the most important Topographical and Historical Books, which * Courier Newspaper, Monday, 23d of March, 1812 \u2022i* Statist.

In the insertion of any peculiar opinions, I have been governed not by the thought of establishing them as my own, but by the desire of recording the extraordinary customs of remote districts, and of handing down to posterity the opinions and manners of the present time. The Work has certainly far exceeded the limits, which I originally intended. It might probably have been compressed into a form more concise, but less useful.

ABBEY GREEN, in the Upper Ward, and Shire of Lanark ; in the Parish of Lesmahagoe. It is 6 m. S.W. from Lanark. This is a pretty large Village, and is so named from being built round the ruins of the ancient Monastery, which was dedicated to St. Machut. ABBEY OF ST. BATHAN'S, vide BOTHAN'S, ST. ABBEY PARISH OF PAISLEY, in the Shire of Renfrew : formerly the Abbey Church, and now served by two Ministers ; the Stipend of the First Minister, in 1811, being 10 chalders of meal, and \u00a38..6..8. for Communion ele ments, and a glebe : the manse is in tolerable repair : \u2014 the Stipend of the Second Minister was 8 chalders of meal, \u00a316..13..4. Sterling in money, and \u00a3'8..6..8. for Communion elements : it has neither manse, nor glebe : The Mar quis of Abercorn is Patron of both Benefices *. The Church is in good repair, and the stile, in which it is fitted up, does great credit to the liberality of the heritors, and the taste and judgment of The Rev. Dr. Boog, who gave the plan and super intended the execution of it. It is in the Presbytery of Paisley, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 14,153, and, in 1811, was For the Abbey District. - 10,392 For that Part, which lies to the East of the river Cart, - - 6,393 16,785 It is contiguous to the Town of Paisley. This Parish is about 9 miles in length, vol. i. B"], [70, "ABB and from half a mile to three miles in breadth. Until the year 1738, it extended over the Town of Paisley ; but an additional Church at that time becoming neces sary, the Town was erected into a separate Parish ; and the original Parish has, since that period, been distinguished by the name of The Abbey Parish, or, more properlv, The Parish of the Abbey of Paisley. The surface is beautifully diversified ; and the soil, along the banks ofthe rivers, is rich and fertile ; but on the eminences, toAvards.the South, it is shallow and cold, on a bottom of gravel or till. The climate is rainy, though not unhealthful. The Forest of Paisley exists only in ancient re cords; as there are now not more than 140 acres of natural wood, upon three or four different estates. The Public roads are in good repair. Coals, lime-stone, and free-stone, of excellent quality, are abundant. The Priory of Paisley was founded, in 1164, by Walter, son of Alan, Lord High Steward of Scotland; it was aftenvards raised to the Dignity of an Abbey, for Monks of the Cluniac Order, and the lands belonging to it were by Robert the Second erected into a. Regal ity, under the Jurisdiction of the Abbot. The last Abbot was John Hamilton, natural Son to James Earl of Arran ; who, upon his promotion to the See of St. Andrew's, in 1546, resigned the Abbacy of Paisley in favour of Lord Claud Hamilton, third son of the Duke of Chatelherault, and Earl of Arran, Gov ernor of Scotland. This Lord Claud was a steady adherent to the cause of Queen Mary, and was at the field of Lang side, in 1568, for which he Avas forfeited : and Paisley, thus in the hands of the Crown, was bestowed by the Regent upon Robert, son to William Lord Semple, Heritable Baillie of Paisley, and Justi ciary of that Regality ; but Lord Claud being afterAvards restored to his for tune, he obtained a Charter, in 1587, from King James the Sixth, erecting the lands of the Abbey into a Temporal Lordship ; and, in 1591, he was by the same Prince created a Peer, by the title of Lord Paisley : In 1604, his eldest son James was created Lord Abercorn, and, in 1606, was raised to the dignity of an Earl : who, in 1652, disposed of the Lordship of Paisley to the Earl of Angus, by whom it was again alienated, in 1653, to William, first Earl of Dundonald; in which family it continued until the year 1764, when the late Earl of Aber corn re-purchased this paternal inheritance of his family. The Monks of this place are said to have Avritten a Chronicle of the affairs of Scotland, called \" The Black Book of Paisley,\" from the colour of its cover, an authentic copy of which is said to have been burned in the Abbey of Holyrood House, during Cromwell's Usurpation : another copy of this curious monument of antiquity, cited frequently by Buchanan, belonged to the President Spottiswood's Li brary, which after his death was carried into England by General Lambert, and"], [71, "ABB is now in The British Museum. This was the common burial place of the Noble family of the Founder, until they became Kings of Scotland ; and, although King Robert the Second, the first of this Race who attained to that dignity, was buried at Scone, yet nevertheless his first Lady, Elizabeth Muir, and Euphemia Ross, his Queen, were both buried here, as was likewise Mar gery Bruce his mother. There is scarcely a vestige now remaining of the Monastery, and the garden is built upon. The Abbey Church, when entire, has been a grand building, in the form of a Cross : the great North Window is a noble ruin, the arch very lofty, the middle Pillar wonderfully light, and still en tire : only the Chancel now remains, which is divided into a middle and two side Aisles, all very lofty pillars, with Gothic arches : the outside of the building is decorated with a profusion of ornaments, especially the great West and North doors, than which scarcely any thing lighter or richer can be imagined. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. The Earl of Abercorn's burial place here, is said to be famous for a remarkable Echo. The vestiges of the Roman Camp near this, are at present almost annihilated : of the outAvorks mentioned by Camden, there are no traces of any excepting one at a place, called Castle Head, where a few marks are still left : there had been a military road leading to the Camp, which is said to have been the Vanduaria of Richard of Cirencester. The various weaving branches are carried on to a great extent here : The Abbey Parish, or New Town, on the Eastern bank of the river White Cart, being nearly equal in Population to the Town of Paisley. ABBEY, The, v. LOGIE. ABBOT-RULE, in the District of Jedburgh, and Shire of Roxburgh: for merly a Rectory : Patron, The Crown. This Parish is now united to the Parish of South-Dean. It extends nearly four miles, along the East side of the river Rule. Under David the First, this ancient Manor was distinguished by the Name of Rule Hervey, from a former Lord of the Manor, whose Name was Hervey. When David founded the Monastery of Jedburgh, he granted to it Rulam Herevie, according to its true boundaries. The old name was now dropt : and, the Abbot, and his Canons, naturally called their own Manor, Abbot-Ru\\e, to distinguish their own Rule, from so many other Rules : and this Manor was distinguished, in the Latin charters of that age, by the name of Rule- Abbatis. It is 5f m. S. b. W. from Jedburgh. ABBOT'S-H ALL, in the District of Kirkaldy, and Shire of Fife : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 46 bolls of barley, 34 bolls of oat-meal, 36 bolls of oats, and 100 merks in money : the manse was built in B2"], [72, "ABD 1772: the glebe consists of 6^ acres : Patron, Robert Ferguson, Esq., of Raith: The Church was lately re-built in an elegant style. It is in the Presbytery of Kirkaldy, and Synod of Fife. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 2501, and, in 1811, was 2879. The Church is \u00a3m. W. from Kirkaldy. This Parish contains about 3165 acres, mostly inclosed, and well cultivated. Its general appearance is exceedingly pleasant, rising gradually from the coast ofthe Firth of Forth to the Northward, where it terminates in pretty high ground. The air is dry, and salubrious. Lime-stone, and coals of a superior quality, are in great abundance. A considerable quantity of coarse linen is manufactured in the village, which is called Linktown. The Salary of the Parochial School is about \u00a37., together Avith School-fees, and perquisites, and \u00a35. for teaching poor Scholars, being the interest of \u00a3'100. bequeathed some years ago, by a gentleman of the name of Dundas. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. This Parish is said to derive its name from an Abbot of Dunfermlin, who built a coun try-house near the Church, and called it The Hall of the Abbot ; it Avas disjoined from the Parish of Kirkaldy, and erected into a distinct Parish in 1650. But some of the Heritors of Abbot's-Hall retained their seats in the old Church of Kirkaldy ; and, by a decreet of the Court of Session in 1685, were found liable in their proportion of the repairs : by the same decreet, the Teinds of Abbot's- Hall are subject to the repairs of the Choir of Kirkaldy. Raith is the elegant and commodious Mansion of the truly respectable Family of Ferguson ; who have surrounded it with extensive Plantations, and otherwise adorned and en riched the Parish by their general benevolence and patriotic exertions. Robert Ferguson, Esq., the present proprietor of Raith, has added greatly to the beauty of the place by an extensive artificial Lake. ABBOT'S TOWER, v. NEW ABBEY. ABB S, ST., HEAD, v. COLDINGHAM. ABDIE, in the District of Cupar, and Shire of Fife : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 55j bolls of bear, 62^ bolls of oats, 201 bolls of oat-meal, \u00a310..5..0. in money, and a glebe ; the manse is in tolerable repair : Patron, The Earl of Mansfield : The Church is an old narrow build ing, and badly lighted. It is in the Presbytery of Cupar, and Synod of Fife. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 723, and in 1811, was 768. It is 2| m. S. S. E. from Newburgh. This Parish is of great extent, and is divided into three parts, by the intervention of the adjacent Parishes. The surface is very uneven ; but there is a considerable quantity of arable land, which is toler ably fertile, and Avell cultivated. The climate is very salubrious. The Loch of"], [73, "ABE Lindores is nearly a mile in length, and of unequal breadth : it abounds with perch, and pike, and various aquatic birds. Here are three Quarries of fine granite, from whence considerable quantities have been exported for paving the streets of London. The Salary of the Parochial School is 2 bolls of bear, 2 bolls of oats, and a house, and small garden. The roads are in bad repair. Den Mill Castle, now in ruins, formerly belonged to the Earls of Fife ; by whom it was given to the ancient and respectable family of Balfour, in whose possession it still remains. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. Upon the banks ofthe Lake, in a romantic and beautiful situation, are the ruins of the Mansion-house of Old Lindores, formerly the Seat of the Ancient and Noble family of Leslie, Baron Lindores, now dormant. ABER ARDER, v. DUNLICHTY. ABER-BROTHOCK, or ARBROATH, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Shire of Forfar : it formerly belonged to the Parish of St. Vigean's, but was erected into a Parochial Charge about the year 1560 : the Stipend ofwhich, in 1811, was 19 chalders of victual, 6 bolls ofwhich are wheat, the rest oat-meal and barley in equal portions, with about \u00a3100. in money, including rent for Teind fish, allowance for House-rent, Communion elements, and rent ofthe Church-yard grass : there is no glebe: Patron, The Crown : The Church is built in the South-west corner of the Abbey ground, and the Tower serves for a bell steeple : it is neat, and commodious. Arbroath is a single Charge, but the Minister has an Ordained Assistant, Avho officiates as his Colleague, and whose Stipend arises in part from the Interest of \u00a3565., &c, mortified by a Convener Mill, and others, for that purpose ; and some Gentlemen in the town have engaged to make it at least equal to \u00a360. per annum. It is in the Presbytery of Aber-Brothock, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 4943, and, in 1811, was 5590, including the Seamen ; but the whole of the Population, including that part of it which lies in the Parish of St. Vigean's, was above 8000. It is 58 m. N. N. E. from Edinburgh. The Market is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the 31st of January, the third Wednesday in June, and the 18th of July. A General Post- Office is established here, which now yields a revenue of \u00a3 1400. per annum. There are three Branches of Banks in this Town, viz, of the Dundee Banking Company, of the Dundee New Bank, and of the Dnndee Union Bank, the last of which has but lately been established. This toAvn is pleasantly situated on a small Plain, near the confluence of the river Brothock, with the German Ocean. The body of the Town consists of one Street, nearly half a mile in length, running"], [74, "ABE North and South from the Sea, and another on the West side of smaller extent ; both of these are intersected by other Cross Streets. To the Eastward of the Toavii, on the ground formerly the Abbey Garden, there are tAvo neat regular Streets, and at the top of one of them is an elegant Chapel of Ease. Aber- Brothock is a Royalty of very ancient date ; it being the general opinion, that it Avas erected into a Royal Borough by King William the Lion, about the year 1 186 ; but this cannot properly be ascertained, oAving to the loss of the original Charter, Avhich was taken by force out of the Abbey, where it Avas deposited in the time of the Civil Avars, during the minority of James the Sixth, by George, Bishop of Moray, called Postulat of Arbroath. It was, however, confirmed in its privileges by a writ of novodamus from James the Sixth, in 1599. It is governed by a Provost, 2 Baillies, a Treasurer, and 15 Counsellors : the Dean of Guild, and Deacon Convenor of the Seven Incorporated Trades, are Members of Council ex officio : and besides the ToAvn Clerk, there are five Writers, avIio are Notaries Public, and two Messengers at Arms. The Revenues, arising principally from rents of land, harbour dues, town's mills, and tAvo-pence Scotch on each pint of Ale sold within the Royalty, amount to about \u00a31200. Sterling. It is one of the Contributary Boroughs with Aberdeen, in sending one Member to Parliament. The Harbour, which Avas originally at the end of the East Causeway, was formed about the year 1 194 ; but being ill constructed, a Brief Avas obtained for building a new Pier, in 1725 ; this is situate a little to the West of the old one ; it is strongly built of stone, and though small, is very com- modious, and admits of vessels lying close to any part of it, either to receive or discharge their cargoes : it is always dry at low water : at Spring tides, there is a depth of 15 or 16 feet at its entrance ; and at Neep tides, of 9 or 10 feet. A considerable foreign trade is carried on with Russia, Norway, and Sweden, as well as in lime, coals, and corn. The principal manufactures are Sail-cloth, Osnaburghs, and other brown linens. Here is a Stamp-Office. The Harbour is defended by a neat Battery, of six twelve-pounders, erected on the Ballast- Hill in 1783, in consequence of an attack made on the Town by a small French Privateer, named the Fearnought, of Dunkirk, commanded by one Fall, an American. Here are three established Schools ; the Grammar School, the English School, and the School for writing, arithmetic, mathematics, &c. : each Master has a Salary from the Town of \u00a325. per annum, besides School-fees. There are likewise two or three private Schools. The air is dry, and salubrious. The Chalybeate Spring in the high ground, called The Common, is now dried up, OAving to the deepening of a ditch close by it. The glory ofthis place"], [75, "ABE was The Abbey, the venerable ruins of which are much admired, and still convey an idea of its ancient magnificence. It was one of the richest and most sumptuous Abbies in Scotland, and was founded in 1 178 by King Wil liam, the Lion, who was buried here : It was dedicated to St. Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, and filled with Benedictine or Tyronensian Monks, brought from the Abbey of Kelso; whose Abbot declared those of this place, on their first institution, to be free from his Jurisdiction. This Monastery for- merly enjoyed great and uncommon privileges ; its Abbots were frequently the first Church-men of the Kingdom ; and a Charter is still extant, from King John of England, under the Great Seal, by which the Monastery, and the citizens of Aber-Brothock are exempted, a teloniis et consuetudine, in every part of England, except London and Oxford. It has also been of considerable note in the Scottish History, particularly as the Seat of that Parliament during the reign of King Robert Bruce, on the 6th of April 1320, in which the celebrated Manifesto was addressed to Pope John, on account of the hardships which Scotland endured from the Anathemas of His Holiness, and the Invasions of Edavard the First : a Manifesto almost unequalled for the spirit of its remon- strance, and the liberty of sentiment which it avowed. There is no immediate answer extant from the Pope ; but there is reason to suppose, that this very important remonstrance had great weight ; for, in August of the same year, he sent a Bull to Edward, to exhort him to make peace with the Scots, in order that the operations against the Infidels in The Holy Land might be pursued without interruption. There is also a Letter from His Holiness to the same Prince, to acquaint him, that, at the earnest request of Robert, he had suspended the sentence of Excommunication, perhaps through fear of losing* the whole Scottish Nation by too rigorous a procedure. The last Ecclesiastic Abbot was the famous Cardinal Beaton, who was at the same time Archbishop of St. Andrew's. The last Commendatory Abbot of this House was John Hamilton, second son to the Duke of Chastelherault, afterwards created Marquis of Hamilton: on the 5th of May, 1608, it was erected into a Temporal Lordship in favour of his son James, and now gives the title of Baron to the Duke of Hamilton. This Abbey afterwards belonged to the Earl of Dysart, from whom it was purchased, with the right of Patronage of Thirty-four Parish Churches belonging to it, by Patrick Maule, of Panmure, Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber to King James the Sixth, in which family it remained until the year 1715, when it escheated to the Crown by forfeiture, and was under the management of the Barons ofthe Exchequer. In 1752, part of the site of the Abbey was obtained by"], [76, "ABE the Town. For the administration of Justice, the Convent elected and paid an Officer, called \" Baillie ofthe Regality,\" which became Hereditary : the family of Airly held it before the Reformation, and until the year 1747, when it was sold and vested in the Crown, with other Heritable Jurisdictions : the walls of the Regality Prison are still remaining. Part ofthe Abbot's house is also still stand ing, and inhabited ; in Avhich are some of the ancient floors, and several hand some can ings in oak. Mr. Grose has preserved tAvo views of this Abbey ; who adds, that, on the whole, though not the most elegant when entire, yet from the magnitude of its parts, it is the most magnificent in Scotland. Aber-Brothock is in the Latitude of 56\u00b0 35' 7\" North, and the Longitude of 2\u00b0 33' 12\" West from the Royal Obsenatory at Greenwich. \u2014 The Parish of Aber-Brothock is of small extent, consisting of the Town and Royalty, having been separated from the Parish of St. Vigean's, in which it formerly was included. Around the town the soil is rich and fertile ; but, towards the North-west, there is a con siderable extent of muiry ground, the property of the Community, and Avhich Avas lately covered with thriving plantations ; but these have been cut down, and the ground is feued to different persons ; several of whom have built ele gant Villas, and improved the lands : which, besides enriching the prospect, is of real advantage to the Community at large. ABER-CAIRNEY, v. BLACKFORD. ABER-CAIRNEY, v. FOULIS, WESTER, and MONZIE. ABER-CHERDER, v. MARNOCH. ABERCORN, or ABER CORNIE, in the Shire of Linlithgow: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend ofwhich, in 1811, was 64 bolls 2 pecks 2 lippies of meal, 60 bolls 1 lippie of barley, 4 bolls 2 pecks 2 lippies of wheat, \u00a349..16..5. Sterling in money, and \u00a38..6..8. for Communion elements, with the usual accommoda tions of Manse, Offices, Garden, and a Glebe : Patron, The Earl of Hopeton: The Church is ancient. It is in the Presbytery of Linlithgow, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 814, and, in 1811, was 885. It is 5^ m. N.E. b. E. from Linlithgow. The Church, and Village, are pleasantly situate upon an angular point, and from 60 to 80 feet above the level of the Sea : at the eminence, about an hundred yards below the Church, the Cornie and Meidhope Burns are united, and, after running a short distance, between lands of equal elevation with that upon which the Church and Village are situate, and which approach towards each other so as to form a beautiful opening, they fall into the Forth. This Parish is about 4 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth : the surface is irregular ; but, except"], [77, "ABE Binns Hill and Priest-Inch Hill, none ofthe rising grounds desene the name of Hills : and all the lands are inclosed, and well cultivated. The minerals of this Parisii are freestone, limestone, coals, and iron-stone ; but only the limestone, which is of superior quality, is worked. The Parochial School is the only place of education ; and Avhich, from the ability and uncommon assiduity of Mr. Robert Murray, the Master, has attained great reputation ; the Salary is 300 merks, besides School-fees, a house, and garden. Abercorn appears to have been always a principal Estate in the Shire of Linlithgow. The Sheriffshipt of the Shire belonged to this Manor, preAious to the passing of the Jurisdiction Act, in 1747. In the Thirteenth Century, this Barony belonged to the ancient Family of Graham : the celebrated Sir John Graham, the friend of Wallace, who fell in the vicinity of Falkirk, bravely fighting for the liberties of his country against Edward the First of England, on the 22d of July 1298, being then the proprietor of it. Since that time, it has belonged to several Noble and distinguished fami - lies, the Douglases, Mores, Lindsays, Hamiltons, and Setons, from whom the Barony came by purchase, in 1678, to John Hope, one of the ancestors ofthe present Noble proprietors In 1601, it gave the title of Earl to James Hamilton, the heir of Claud, Lord Paisley : and, after various transmissions, the Earldom was, in 1790, expanded into the Marquisate of Abercorn, in England, and Viscount Strabane, in Ireland : His Lordship being the only Peer who enjoys a Scottish, British, and Irish title. Hopeton House is the princely Residence of the Noble Family of Johnstone, Earl of Hopeton. It is generally believed, that the Wall of Antoninus began in this Parisii ; though it is more probable, from the authority of Bede, that it did not extend so far, and that the point on which Blackness Castle is built, was its Eastern extremity. The Monastery of Aber corn was one of the most ancient in Scotland, mention being made of it in the Seventh Century, when it was the residence of a Bishop. Abercorn Castle is thought to have had its original in a Roman Fort : it was a place of great strength, and was dismantled, in 1455, during the rebellion of the Earl of Douglas : but there are now no remains either of the Monastery, or Castle. Meidhope was formerly \" a fine Tower-house,\" belonging to the Earl of Hopeton. ABERCROMBIE, in the District of St. Andrew's, and Shire of Fife : an ancient Parish, now annexed to the Parisii of St. Monance : The Church is in ruins, but the manse and glebe are situate here. It is 2 m. W. from Pitten weem. Prior to the annexation, the Village of Abercrombie was pretty populous, but since that period it has gone to decay, About two-thirds of the lands of Abercrombie, which contain upwards of 600 acres, are inclosed, and well vol. i. C"], [78, "ABE cultivated. This estate is the property of Sir John Anstruther, Bart. Here are several seams of coal, which are yet untouched. Game is abundant. In 1655, Abercrombie gave the title of Baron to the family of Sandilands, noAV extinct. See, Monanee, St. ABERDALGIE, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Vicarage, with the Parish of Duplin united, in 1618 ; the Stipend of Avhich, in 1811, Avas 32 bolls of meal, 16 bolls of barley, and \u00a374..18..8^ Sterling, including \u00a33..6..8. for Communion elements : the manse is in good repair : the glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Patron, The Earl of Kinnoul : The Church was built by the late Earl in 1773, and is one of the best small Churches in Scotland. It is in the Presbytery of Perth, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Popula tion ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 542, and, in 1811, was 513. It is 3\u00a3 m. SW. b. S. from Perth. This Parish is about 2\\ miles in length, and 2\\ miles in breadth, stretching along the Northern bank of the river Earn. The surface rises gradually from the river, affording a great variety of soil, from the richest clay to the poorest, thin sand ; but it is, in general, tolerably fertile. The climate is healthy. Free-stone is abundant. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, a free house, School-house, and garden. The Earl of Kinnoul is proprietor of the whole Parish ; it having been the property of this Noble Family since the year 1625, when it was pur chased from the Earl of Morton : and having, for some centuries before, belonged to the family of Lord Oliphant, in favour of Avhose ancestors it Avas granted by David the Second, to be holden in one entire and free Barony. Near the Church, at a place called Monday, are the foundations ofa building which also belonged to the family of Oliphant, and which tradition still calls by the name of Kemp or Camp Castle. At the East end of the Church is a vault, which is now the Burial-place ofthe Noble family of Kinnoul. ABERDEEN, NEW, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the District of Aberdeen, and Shire of Aberdeen : formerly a Rec tory and Vicarage, now served by four Ministers, with each a Stipend of \u00a3150. : Patrons, The Magistrates and Town Council : The Church, which is dedicated to St. Nicholas, was re-built about the year 1754, and comprehends the East and West Churches under the same roof. It is in the Presbytery, and Synod, of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of the Parisii of St. Nicholas, in 1801, (containing The New Town of Aberdeen, Even Quarter, Foot Dee Quarter, Green Quarter, and Crooked Quarter) was 17,597, and, in 1811, was 21,639. It is 121a m. N. N. E. from Edinburgh. The Market is well supplied. The"], [79, "ABE Fairs are holden on the first Tuesday in May, the second Tuesday in June, the first Tuesday in October, and the first Tuesday in December. A General Post- Office is established here. This is said to be one of the oldest Communities in Scotland, and to have been erected into a Royal Borough as early as 893 ; but the most ancient Charter now extant, is from King William the Lion, of which the date is wanting; many other Charters have been granted by successive Monarchs, and its Civil Government is now vested in a Provost, denominated Lord Provost, four Baillies, a Dean of Guild, Treasurer, Town Clerk, and a Town Council of nineteen. The Provost, and Baillies, are Sheriffs, Coroners, and Justices of the Peace, within the Burgh, and whole bounds of the Freedom lands, and Salmon-fishings on the Dee, which are holden of the Crown ; the Provost being named Sheriff and Coroner's Principal, and the Baillies, Sheriffs and Coroners Depute ; which several offices of Sheriff and Justices of the Peace, the Magistrates are in the constant practice of exercising, in all causes coming before them in these capacities, and of holding Quarter Sessions for the Burgh in the same manner as the Justices of the County. The Magistrates have also the same powers, jurisdiction, and authority within the Port, Harbour, and Flood-mark of Aberdeen, and whole bounds thereof, as well as within the rivers Dee and Don to the two bridges, as they have within the Burgh itself and Liberties, and have always exercised that Jurisdiction and Authority accordingly. In 1795, an Act of Parliament was obtained, empowering the inhabitants to elect 13 Commissioners of Police, and for raising an Assessment, for paving, lighting, and cleaning the Streets, and supplying the City with water. Aberdeen, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of Montrose, Brechin, Aber-Brothock, and Inver-Bervie, sends one Member to Parliament ; Aberdeen being the presiding Borough. This is the Capital of the Shire of Aberdeen, and the chief City of the North of Scotland ; it is situate on a rising* ground, near the \u00c6stuary of the river Dee into the German Ocean, and was at a very early period burnt and destroyed by the English, but being afterwards rebuilt by King David Bruce, who resided here for some time, and where he erected a Mint, the whole Town was accordingly called The New Town of Aberdeen, in contradistinction to The Old one, which had been consumed. It is now a large and handsome City, having many spacious streets, lined on each side by elegant houses, built of granite from the neighbouring* Quarries. In the middle of Castle Street is the Cross, an octagon stone building, highly ornamented with bas-relievos of the Kings of Scotland, from James the First to James the Sixth, with a Corinthian column in the centre, on the summit of which is an Unicorn. The High Court C2"], [80, "ABE of Justiciary, for the Northern Circuit, is holden here. The Grammar School is a low, but neat building, and is Avell conducted by an able and diligent Rector and three Assistants, avIio have good appointments. There are a number of excellent Charitable Institutions, particularly Gordon's Hospital, founded and endowed by Mr. Robert Gordon, a Merchant in this City, in 1730 ; and the Governors of which were incorporated by Royal Charter in 1772, under the name of The President and Governors (--/Robert Gordon's Hospital in Aberdeen; \u2014 The Infirmary, a large plain building, established in 1739, and supported by subscriptions, collections, and donations ; the Managers Avere also incorporated in 1772; \u2014 and, The Lunatic Hospital, built by subscription, in 1800, about half a mile from the town. A little to the Eastward of the Town, are elegant and commodious Barracks, capable of accommodating upwards of 600 men, and erected in 1794, on the site of a Fortification built there by Oliver Cromavell. The trade of Aberdeen is considerable ; but might be greatly extended by the prosecution of the white fisheries. The harbour, which is formed by the Dee, was long a detriment to its commerce, and occasioned the loss of many lives, and much property, being* interrupted by a dangerous shifting bar of sand : but this inconvenience is now removed by a new Pier, on the North side of the river, which was erected according to a plan of the celebrated Mr. Smeaton : it is 1200 feet long, built of huge blocks of granite, and admits vessels of 200 tons burden. Near the Pier, are two batteries, mounting ten twelve-pounders, for the defence of the Harbour and Shipping. It formerly enjoyed a great share in the North American trade ; but, at present, its chief imports are from the Baltic, and a few merchants trade to the Levant, and the West Indies. Its exports are stockhigs, thread, linens, salmon, grain, meal, and pickled pork, which is in hio*h reputation. Here are two private Banking Companies; and an Insurance Com pany against losses by fire, on a respectable plan, and with a large capital. The Convent of the Observantines, a building of great length in the middle of the city, was founded by the Citizens, and Mr. Richard Vaus, in 1450. In the College Church, which belonged to the Grey Friars, and was purchased by the Magistrates from the College, is a Chapel of Ease. There was also a Monas tery of Carmelite or White Friars, said to have been founded in 1350, by Philip de Arbuthnot, of that Ilk, ancestor to the present Viscount of that Name, in honour of the Virgin Mary. Marischal College, and University, was founded and richly endowed by George Earl Marischal of Scotland, in 1598 : the original foundation was a Principal, and two Professors of Philosophy; but, by some munificent donations, there have since been added another Professorship of"], [81, "ABE Philosophy, one of Divinity, and others for Medicine, Mathematics, Natural History, Greek, Oriental Languages, Chemistry, and Anatomy ; and many Bur saries for poor Students. The buildings are situate in the Broad Street of New Aberdeen, and contain, besides Lecture Rooms for the different classes, the Public School for the conferring of Degrees, a Common- Hall, ornamented with some fine Paintings by Jamieson, and others, the Library, and a small Museum of Natural History, and Antiquities. The College also contains an Observa tory, well furnished with Astronomical apparatus. The Officers are, the Chan cellor (iioav The Right Honourable Lord Auckland), the Rector (now Alexan der Baxter, Esq.), the Dean of Faculties (now Sir Robert Burnett, Bart.), the Regent, who is also Professor of Greek, and the Principal. \" The Hall of The Marischal College,\" says Dr. Johnson, \" is large, and well lighted. One of its ornaments is the picture of Arthur Johnston, who was Principal of the College, and who holds among the Latin Poets of Scotland the next place to the elegant Buchanan. In the Library I was shewn some curiosities ; a Hebrew manuscript of exquisite penmanship, and a Latin translation of Aristotle's Politicks by Leonardus Aretinus, written in the Roman character with nicety and beauty, which, as the art of printing has made them no longer necessary, are not now to be found. This was one of the latest performances of the transcribers, for Aretinus died (in 1443) but about twenty years before Typography was invented. This version has been printed, and may be found in Libraries, but is little read ; for the same books have been since translated both by Victorius and Lambinus, avIio lived in an age more cultivated, but perhaps owed in part to Aretinus that they were able to excel him. Much is due to those who first broke the way to knowledge, and left only to their successors the task of smoothing it.\" \u2014 The Parish of New Aberdeen, or St. Nicholas, is of small extent, being confined to the limits of the Town on every side, except the South-East, where it extends to the Sea, including the village of Foot Dee. The circumjacent country is hilly, but not mountainous : and abounds in Quarries of excellent Granite. The soil is naturally rather barren and thin ; but, by culti vation, is rendered both deep and fertile. The air is commonly sharp, dry, and healthy. On the West side ofthe Town is a Chalybeate spring, called The Well of Spa, which is said to have been found efficacious, and an essay on its virtues was published by Dr. Barclay. About two miles South of the Town, is a fine bridge over the river Dee, first erected by Bishop Dunbar, in 1530 ; but having gone to decay, was re-built by the Magistrates out of the funds belonging to itself, in 1724 ; and is still supported by funds destined for that purpose by its"], [82, "y ABE original promoter, Bishop Elphinston. This City has given birth to many emi nent characters ; but it would be unpardonable not to mention the celebrated Painter, George Jamieson, the Scottish Vandyke. The Observatory is in the Latitude of 57\u00b0 8' 59\" North, and the Longitude of 2\u00b08'0\" West from Greenwich. See, Aberdeen, Old. ABERDEEN, OLD, a City, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the District of Aberdeen, and Shire of Aberdeen : formerly a Deanry, now served by two Ministers, with each a Stipend of \u00a3150., but without either manse, or glebe : The Earl of Fife is Patron of both Charges : The Cathedral, Avhich was dedicated to St. Machar, and Avas formerly a very magnificent edifice, fell a sacri- fice to the religious frenzy of the Reformers, and a part of it iioav only remains, which is used as the Parish Church. It is in the Presbyter}*, and Synod, of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this City, and Parish, (comprehending the City of Old Aberdeen, and the Spittal, the Town of Gilcomston, and the Villages of Windmill-Brae, Hardgate, the Bridge of Don, and Printfield) in 1801, was 9911, and, in 1811, was 13,731. It is pleasantly situate on an eminence, near the confluence ofthe river Dun with the German Ocean, and about a mile and a quarter to the Northward of The New Town of Aberdeen ; the intenening space between the rivers Don and Dee being mostly occupied by regular streets and buildings, which form the present City of New Aberdeen. Old Aberdeen is a place of great antiquity, and was of considerable importance so long ago as the end of the Ninth Century ; when, according to tradition, King Gregory the Great conferred upon it some peculiar privileges. But no authentic records are extant, prior to the year 1154 ; in which year David the First translated the Episcopal See from Mortlach to this place : and, hi the same year, the Town of Old Aberdeen was erected into a Free Burgh of Barony, holding directly of the Crown. This Charter has been renewed by many successive Sovereigns, and was finally established by a Charter from Kmg George the First, by which the power of electing their own Magistracy, is vested in the free Burgesses of the Town. The Magistrates are a Provost, three Baillies, a Treasurer, and Council, with the Deacons of six Incorporated Trades. The Market is on Thursday. The Fair is holden on the Thursday before Easter. Here is a neat Town House, a Trades' Hospital, and an Hospital for 12 poor men, founded in 1532 by Bishop William Dunbar. The Trades' Hospital, and Trinity Church, are built on the site of the Convent of Mathurines. The Dominicans had also a House here, founded by Alexander the Second. On the West side of the Town is a modern Free Grammar School ; and, on the Sea-coast, a Fort, and the remains of the"], [83, "ABE Castle which was destroyed by Oliver Cromwell. The Bishop's Palace stood at the East end ofthe Cathedral, communicating with the Chancel, but only the site and fosse* now remain. Mr. Grose has presened a view of the Cathedral. King's College, the chief ornament ofthe place, is a large and stately fabric, situate on the East side of the Town : It was founded in 1494, by William Elphin stone, Bishop of this place, and Lord Chancellor of Scotland in the reign of James the Third, and Lord Privy seal in that of James the Fourth, and dedicated to St. Mary; but, being taken under the immediate protection ofthe King, it was denominated King's College, and endowed Avith very large revenues. The building is extensive, containing a Chapel, Library, Museum, Common-Hall, and rooms for the Lectures ; and a long uniform range of modern houses for the accom modation ofthe Professors, and such Students as choose to live in the College. Behind is the Garden ofthe College, and the Principal's House and Garden. The Library is furnished Avith a variety of good books, and has a fund for augment ing it. In the Cathedral was also a valuable Library, which was almost totally de stroyed at the Reformation. The square Tower on the side ofthe College was built by contributions from General Monk and the Officers under him, then quartered at Aberdeen, for the reception of Students. Tliere are a number of Bursaries, well endowed. The Officers are, a Chancellor (now The Duke of GoRDON),a Rector, en titled Lord Rector (now The Right Honourable Lord Glenbervie), a Principal, Sub-Principal, who is also one ofthe Regents or Professors of Natural Philosophy, together with Professors of Divinity, Civil Law, Medicine, Greek, Humanity, Natural Philosophy, Oriental Languages, and a Procurator who has charge ofthe Funds. King's College, and Marischal College situate in the City of New Aberdeen, are distinct from each other, as Colleges and Universities : various attempts have been made to unite them, but without effect. The Crown is superior of both Colleges ; having succeeded to the King's College on the abolition of Episcopacy, and to the latter on the attainder of the late Earl Marischal, in 1715 ; but has never interfered in the election of their Chancellors, or Rectors. \" Old Aber deen,\" says Dr. Johnson, \" is the ancient Episcopal City, in Avhich are still to be seen the remains of the Cathedral. It has the appearance ofa Town in decay, having been situated, in times when commerce was yet unstudied, with very little attention to the commodities of the harbour. In each of the Old and New Towns there is a College, or in stricter language an University ; for, in both there are Professors of the same parts of learning, and the Colleges hold their Sessions and confer Degrees separately, with total independence of one on the other. In Old Aberdeen stands The King's College, of which the First"], [84, "ABE President Avas Hector Boece or Boethius, who may be justly reverenced as one ofthe revivers of elegant learning. When he studied at Paris, he was acquainted with Erasmus, who afterwards gave him a public testimony of his esteem, by inscribing to him a Catalogue of his works. The style of Boethius, though perhaps, not always rigorously pure, is formed with great diligence upon ancient models, and wholly uninfected with Monastic barbarity. His history is Avritten Avith elegance and vigour, but his fabulousness and credulity are justly blamed. His fabulousness, if he was the author of the fictions, is a fault for Avhich no apology can be made ; but his credulity may be excused in an age, when all men Avere credulous. Learning was then rising on the world ; but ages so long accustomed to darkness, were too much dazzled Avith its light to see any thing distinctly. The first race of Scholars in the Fifteenth Century, and some time after, were, for the most part, learning to speak, rather than to think, and Avere therefore more studious of elegance than of truth. The contemporaries of Boethius thouo*ht it sufficient to know what the ancients had delivered. The examination of tenets and of facts Avas resened for another generation. Boethius, as President of the University, enjoyed a revenue of 40 Scottish marks, about \u00a32..4..6 of Sterling money. In the present age of trade and taxes, it is difficult even for the imagination so to raise the value of money, or so to diminish the demands of life, as to suppose Four-and-forty shillings a year an honourable Stipend ; yet it was probably equal, not only to the needs, but to the rank of Boethius. The wealth of England Avas undoubtedly to that of Scotland more than five to one, and it is known that Henry the Eighth, among whose faults avarice was never reckoned, granted to Roger Ascham, as a reward of his learn ing, a Pension of \u00a310. a year. In both Tlte King's and Marischal 's Colleges the methods of instruction are nearly the same ; the Lectures differing only by the accidental difference of diligence, or ability in the Professors. The Students wear scarlet gowns, and the Professors black, which is, I believe, the Academical dress in all the Scottish Universities, except that of Edinbnrgh, where the Scho lars are not distinguished by any particular habit. In the King's College there is kept a public table, but the Scholars of the Marischal College are boarded in the Town. The expense of living is here, according to the information that I could obtain, someAvhat more than at St. Andrew's. The course of education is extended to four years, at the end of which those who take a degree, who are not many, become Masters of Arts ; and whoever is a Master may, if he pleases, immediately commence Doctor. The title of Doctor, however, was for a consider able time bestoAved on Physicians. The Advocates are examined and approved by"], [85, "ABE their own body ; the Ministers were not ambitious of titles, or were afraid of being censured for ambition ; and the Doctorate in every Faculty was commonly given or sold into other Countries. The Ministers are now reconciled to distinction, and as it must always happen that some will excel others, have thought graduation a proper testimony of uncommon abilities or acquisitions. The indiscriminate collation of Degrees has justly taken away that respect which they originally claimed, as stamps by which the literary value of men so distin- guished was authoritatively denoted. That Academical honours, or any others, should be conferred with exact proportion to merit, is more than human judge- ment or human integrity have given reason to expect. Perhaps Degrees in Universities cannot be better adjusted by any general rule than by the length of time passed in the public profession of Learning. An English or Irish Doc- torate cannot be obtained by a very young man, and it is reasonable to suppose, what is likewise by experience commonly found true, that he who is by age qual- ified to be a Doctor, has in so much time gained learning sufficient not to dis- grace the title, or wit sufficient not to desire it. The Scotch Universities hold but one term or session in the year. That of St. Andrew's continues eight months, that of Aberdeen only five, from the first of November to the first of April. In Aberdeen there is an English Chapel, in which the Congregation was numerous and splendid. The form of Public Worship used by the Church of England, is in Scotland legally practised in licensed Chapels served by Clergymen of Eng- lish or Irish Ordination, and by tacit connivance quietly permitted in separate Congregations, supplied with Ministers by the Successors of the Bishops who Avere deprived at the Revolution. We came to Aberdeen on Saturday, August the 21st (1773). On Monday we were invited into the Town-Hall, where I had the freedom of the City given me by the Lord Provost. The Honour con ferred had all the decorations that Politeness could add, and Avhat I am afraid I should not have had to say of any City South ofthe Ttveed, I found no petty offi- cer bowing for a fee. The Parchment containing the record of admission is, with the seal appending, fastened to a ribband, and worn for one day by the new Citizen in his hat.\" \u2014 The Parish of Old Machar was originally a Deanery, called The Deanery of St. Machar, and comprehended the Parishes of Old Machar, New Machar, and New-hills. New Machar seems to have been erected into a separate Parish about the time of the Reformation, and New-hills about the year 1663. This Parish is now called Old Aberdeen, or The Old Town Parish, from the City of Old Aberdeen, in which the Cathedral, noAv the Parisii vol. i. * D"], [86, "ABE Church, is situate. The Deanery, with its revenue, is appropriated to the Minis ter of St. Machar, and has the Arms of Scotland over the Gate. The Houses of the other Prebends Avere mostly taken doAvn about the year 1725, and little remains except the Chapel in the Prebendary of Kimardin's House. These Houses were mostly on the West and North side ofthe Chancel of the Cathedral, as on the East were houses of the principal Nobility, particularly The Duke of Gordon, all within The Close, which is entered by a Gate, called Clugny's Gate, over which was a figure of the Virgin, the Arms of Scotland and of Aber deen, and on the inner face the Arms of Scotland and Gordon. This Parish is about 8 miles in length, and 4 miles in breadth, stretching along the German Ocean betAveen the rivers Don, and Dee. The surface is agreeably diversified by rising grounds, interspersed with Gentlemen's seats, villas, and plantations, and numerous manufactories. The soil is in general shallow, sandy, and full of stones ; but, by cultivation, is rendered tolerably fertile. The climate is healthy. Here are two Lime-stone Quarries ; and granite, of excellent quality, is in the greatest abundance. Upon the great road leading NortliAvard, a sine Gothic arch Avas, in 1320, flung over the river Don, from one rock to the other ; the height from the top of the arch to the water being 60 feet, and its width 72 feet : it was built by Henry de Cheyne, Bishop of Aberdeen, and NepheAV to John Comyn Lord of Badenoch, who suffering exile for his attachment to the faction ofthe Comyns, on his being restored to his See, applied all the profits that had accumulated during his absence, towards this magnificent work. Aberdeen gives the title of Earl to the Ancient and Illustrious Family of Gordon, one of the Sixteen Peers for North Britain, in the Imperial Parliament, and President of The Society of Antiquaries of London. General Roy supposes Old Aber deen to have been the Roman City Divana. ABERDEEN, SHIRE. This is one ofthe most extensive Counties in Scot land. It forms the North-East corner of the Island, being the Easternmost point ofa large triangle, Avhich juts out far into the German Ocean, and is circumscribed bylines running between Edinburgh, Inverness, and Peterhead. It contains 7 18,860 Statute acres, and 87 Parishes. Its Resident Population, in 1801, was 123,082, and, in 181 1, Avas 135,075. The greatest part ofthis County may be denominated a level plain, agreeably diversified by irregular depressions, and gently swelling slopes, forming a congeries of pleasing knolls, with vales between,, intersected each by its little rill ; so as to exhibit a scenery, the general appearance of which is tolerably uniform, though the particular features of it be varied at every step. It was formerly divided into four Districts, the names ofwhich are still preserved,"], [87, "ABE although they are not recognised in any political sense ; these axe Mar, Formartin, Buchan, and the Garioch. This Shire sends one Member to Parliament. ABERDOUR, in the District of Deer, and Shire of Aberdeen : formerly a Vicarage, belonging to the Chapter of Aberdeen ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, Avas \u00a3150. ; the manse is in tolerable repair: the glebe consists of 7^- acres : Patron, Mr. Gordon, of Aberdour : The Church is very old, and in bad condition. It is in the Presbytery of Deer, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Popula tion ofthis Parish, in 1801, (including the Villages of Aberdour, Dundargue, and Auchmedden) was 1304, and, in 1811, was 1443. It is 159 \\ m. N. b. E. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. It is situate at the con fluence of the Burn of Dour with the Moray Firth, and has a harbour for small vessels. This Parish is about ten miles in length, and six miles and a half in breadth ; exclusive of three detached Farms, by the intervention ofthe Parish of Tyrie, which are about a mile and a half in length, and about the same in breadth, and belong to the Barony of Aberdour. The surface is very uneven ; and the greater part of the soil is cold moss and muir, interspersed with small patches of cultivated land. The coast is bold and rocky, with many caves, the most remarkable of which is one, called Coics-Haven. Upon a lofty precipice, hanging over the sea, are the ruins of the ancient Castle of Dundargue : it was a place of great consequence in the feudal times, and is noted for a long siege, in 1336, when Henry de Beaumont, the English Earl of Buchan, was obliged to capitulate to Andrew Murray, Regent of Scotland, during the captivity of King David Bruce. This Parish is the property of The Earl of Aberdeen, who possesses that part of it, Westward from the Church ; and of Mr. Gordon, who owns the Eastern district, and is resident at Aberdour House, an elegant Seat, surrounded with plantations. ABERDOUR, in the District of Dunfermlin, and Shire of Fife : formerly a Rectory, belonging to the Monastery of Inch-Colm ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 63 bolls 3 firlots of meal, 50 bolls 1 firlot of barley, 15 bolls of oats, \u00a3200. Scotch in money, \u00a38..6..8. for Communion elements, and a glebe : the manse is indifferent : Patron, The Earl of Morton : The Church is in good condition. It is in the Presbytery of Dunfermlin, and Synod of Fife. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1260, and, in 1811, was 1302. It is 8 m. N. b. W. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. It is a plaee of great antiquity, and is pleasantly situate on the Northern bank of the Firth of Forth, with a commodious and safe harbour. There is a Ferry-boat from hence to Leith. The principal manufacture is that of linen. The Nuns, usually styled D2"], [88, "A BE the Poor Clares, had a Convent here, and a field, contiguous to the Minister's Garden, still bears the name of the Sister lands. There is also an Hospital for four Avidows, Avhich was founded by Anne, Countess of Moray. The Parish of Aberdour is about 3 miles in length, and the same in breadth, containing about 5000 acres. It is divided into two districts, by the Cullelo Hills, running from East to West : the Northern district being cold, and poorly cultivated : but the Southern district is fertile, and agriculture is tliere well attended to. The roads are in good repair. Coals, lime-stone, free-stone, and iron-stone, are abundant. A feAV tons of kelp are annually made upon the coast. The Salary of the Paro chial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites. The Western part of the Parish was given by one of the Mortimers to the Monas tery of Inch- Colm, for the privilege of buiying in the Curch : and there is a tra dition, that the corpse of one of the family was thrown over-board in a storm, which gave the name of Mortimer's Deep to the channel between the Island and the shore : This estate, together with the lands and Barony of Beath, are said to have been acquired from an Abbot of Inch- Colm by Sir James Stuart, second son of Andrew Lord Evandale, grandfather by his daughter to the Admirable Crichton, and by his second son, Viscount Doune, to Sir James Stuart, who married the daughter ofthe Regent Murray. Lord Doune was Commendator of the Monastery of Inch- Colm at the Reformation : and the whole of this pro perty, together with the Island itself, is still in the Noble family of Moray, with the title of St. Colm. \u2014 Hill-side, close by the Village, is the elegant Mansion of James Stuart, Esq., of Dunearn, who has greatly embellished the Ground in the neighbourhood. The venerable old Castle of Aberdour stands on the Eastern border of the Parish, upon the banks of a rivulet ; which, winding beautifully in front, shortly falls into the Firth of Forth ; it anciently belonged to the Viponts ; but, in 1 126, Avas transferred to the Mortimers, by marriage, and aftenvards to the Douglases : William Lord of Liddesdale, surnamed The Flower of Chivalry, conveying it by charter, in the reign of David the Second, to James Douglas, ancestor to the present Noble Owner, George Earl of Morton, Lord Aberdour, K. T., and Lord Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household. ABERFELDY, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Weem. It is 77^ m. N. N. W. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. This is a small, but improving Village, with a Muslin manufactory, situate on the great Highland road. Near it, is Moness, the delightful Seat of Mr. Fleming ; and which, according to Mr. Pennant, \" no stranger must omit visiting, it being au epitome of every thing that can be admired in the curiosity of Water-falls.\""], [89, "ABE ABER-FOYLE, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Rectory and Vicarage, the Stipend of which, inl811,was\u00a3122..17..10. in money, \u00a38..6..8. for Communion ele ments, and\u00a327..2..2. by Parliamentary augmentation : the manse is commodious, and in good repair : the glebe consists of upwards of 15 Scotch acres, of good land : Patron, The Duke of Montrose : The Church is a verypoor edifice. It is in the Pres bytery of Dunblane, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 711, and, in 1811, was 601. It is 19 m. W. N. W. from Stirling. This Parish is 1 1 miles in length, and 5 miles in breadth, forming a part of the extreme Precinct ofthe Highlands. It consists ofa long, narrow valley, bounded by lofty mountains, and watered by Loch Catherine, Loch Con, and Loch Ard ; all of which abound with pike, trout, and eels. On the banks of the Lakes, the soil is early and fertile : the hills afford excellent sheep pasture, and many of them are covered with oak woods of great value. The air is sharp, and healthy. The Parochial School is well attended : Besides which, there are other two Schools on the foundation of The Society for propagating Christian Knowledge. Peats are the common fuel, and are in plenty, but are precariously obtained in this rainy climate. The Gaelic language is chiefly in use, though English is gen erally understood : Divine Service being performed in English in the Forenoon, and in Gaelic in the Afternoon. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. The general aspect of the country is extremely picturesque ; and, in the Second Volume of \" Picturesque Views and Scenery of the Thames and Severn, the Forth and the Clyde,\" published by Messrs. Boydells, of London, nine beautiful Drawings, by the masterly pencil of Joseph Farington, Esq., R. A. are devoted to this particular district. The property of this Parish was anciently vested in the Grahams, Earls of Monteith ; but, on the failure of heirs male of that family about the end of the Seventeenth century, their estate came to the Illustrious Family of Montrose ; and His Grace is now sole Heritor, and Supe rior, except of the single Farm of Drumlane, which holds of The Duke of Argyle. This Parish derives its Name from the confluence of the small river Poll Avith the Forth, near the Church : Poll being pronounced Foil or Foyle, in the genitive case of the Gaelic language. ABERGELDIE, v. CRATHIE. ABER-LADY, properly ABER LEDDIE, in the Shire of Hadington : formerly a Prebend, the Stipend ofwhich, in 1811, was \u00a3169., together Avith a manse, and glebe : Patron, The Earl of Wemyss : The ancient Church, Avhich was mean and incommodious, was re-placed by the present edifice, in 1773. It"], [90, "ABE is in the Presbytery of Hadington, and Synod of Lothian and TAveeddale. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 875, and, in 1811, Avas 912. It is 5a m. N. W. from Hadinoton. This Village takes its name from its situation on the river Leddie, which here discharges itself into the Forth : fliough this stream is at present called, above the Village, the West Peffer Water, and, below it, from the name of the adjoining shore, Luffness Water. From Luffness Point the whole Bay between Aber-Lady and Golyn shores is left dry at low Avater, for nearly tAvo miles. At spring tides, vessels of 60 or 70 tons burden may come up the Peffer to Avithin a few hundred yards of Aber-Lady, and lie perfectly safe upon a soft clay bottom, if properly secured by anchors against the Norlh East Avind. It is under the jurisdiction of Preston Pans. Along the shore from Aber-Lady to the Westernmost part of the Parish, runs a tract or border of Links or sandy ground, of considerable breadth, abounding Avith rabbits. Within this border, for a long way, the soil is, for the most part, light, with a mixture of loam : but the middle part ofthe parish, almost from the East to the West extremity of it, is in general poor, flat, sandy, and partly liable to be flooded during heavy rains. From this flat, the ground rises gradually toAvard the South, being part of that fertile bank of land Avhich extends from Easter Falside to White-Kirk. The landed property of this Parish, exclusive of a small part of Red-House, is divided into the four Baronies of Aber-Lady, Gosford, Luffness, and Balncrieff, which is the most extensiA'e. There are no Charity funds or mor tified money in the Parish, except 1600 merks by Sir Peter Wedderburn, Bart., of Gosford ; the yearly interest of which is ordered to be paid to back-gone tenants, and others on these lands. In one of the Aisles of the Church, is a Monument to the Memory of Lady North and Grey, wife of Patrick Lord Elibank, with an inscription composed by his Lordship. In 1695, the Lands of Cotts, and a great part of the Barony of Red-House, were disjoined from Aber- Lady, and annexed to the Parish of Glades-Muir, which was then established. Subordinate to the Mother Church, there Avas a small Chapel, the remains of which may still be traced, at the North-West corner of the Church-yard. On the shore ofthe Forth, there appears to have been, in early times, an establish ment of the Culdees, at a place called Killyspendy, or CU ys pen du, i. e. Tlte Cell ofthe Black Heads, and Avhich was connected with the Culdee Monastery of Dunkeld, by grant of David the First. In 1733, the Barony, with the Patron age ofthe Church, was sold by the family of Fletcher to The Earl of Portmore, from whom it has since passed to The Earl of Wemyss."], [91, "ABE ABER-LEMNO, in the Shire of Forfar : formerly a Vicarage, with the Parish of Auld Barr united, at a period now unknoAvn: the Stipend of which, in 1811, Avas 5 chalders of meal, 2-\u00a7 chalders of barley, \u00a352..13..4. Sterling, with 12 hens, and \u00a35.

It is in the Presbytery of Forfar, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 945, and, in 1811, was 973. It is 5\\ m. N. W. from Forfar. This Parish is about 6 miles in length, and 5 miles in breadth. The surface is various, being partly hilly and covered with heath, but the greater part is flat and fertile, and mostly inclosed : it is in general destitute of wood. It is watered by the river Lemno, which winding round the Hill of the Carse, takes an Easterly direction, and discharges itself into the South Esk about a mile North from the Church, in the adjoining- Parish of Oathlaw. The air is healthy. Moor-stone, free-stone, and slates, are in plenty. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 400 merks, with \u00a31. .3.0. \"paid by the heritors for deficiency of garden ground. The roads are in bad repair. There are four Obelisks, one of them being in the Church-yard, and the other three by the road side leading from Brechin to Forfar; they are curiously carved, and are supposed to have been erected in commemoration of victories obtained over the Danes. A little to the Northward of these Obelisks is a hill, called Grave Hill, at the foot of which is a stagnant Pool, called The Grave Loch ; and on trenching the ground there, some years ago, many human bones were discovered, and part of a brass instrument, and another of iron. About a mile East from the Church are the fine ruins of Melgund Castle : it was built by Cardinal Beaton for a natural son, who Avas married to a lady of the family of Panmure ; their initials are on different parts of the building, and also on the North Wall of the aisle of the Church, beloAV which is a Vault that Avas their burying-place. A little to the Northward ofthe Castle, is an artificial mound of earth, called The Moat of Melgund, where the Baron formerly administered justice, and near it is the Gallows Hill, Avhere are several tumuli : This Estate is now the property of Lord Minto. The Grandfather, Father, and present Incumbent have sened the Cure here in lineal succession for 102 years. Fuel is scarce, and expensive."], [92, "ABE ABERLOUR, in the Shire of Banff : formerly a Prebend, with the ancient Parish of Skir-Durstan united; the Stipend of Avhich, in 1811, was \u00a358..6..8. in money, and 18 bolls of meal, at 8 stone the boll, with a little more than 5 acres of arable ground for a glebe, and somewhat more than an acre of grass, together Avith a manse, garden, and offices : Patron, The Earl of Fife : The Church, which is very old, was repaired in 1786. It is in the Presbytery of Aberlour, of which it is the Seat, and in the Synod of Moray. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 815, and, in 1811, Avas 908. It is 4-j m. W. N. W. from Mortlach. It is situate at the confluence of the noisy burn of Lour with the river Spey. This Parish is about 9 miles in length, and 7 miles in breadth. The soil on the banks of the Spey, and Fiddich, is flat and sandy ; but, toAvards the South, it is hilly, with a deep clay bottom ; and both are abun dantly fruitful, when properly cultivated. In the centre of the Parish stands the lofty Mountain of Bett-Rinnes. It abounds Avith game. At Kinnermonie there are the remains of an old Gothic building, which, tradition says, Avas a Religious House, and that all its inhabitants were massacred in one night. ABER LUTHNET, v. MARY KIRK. ABER-NETHY, in the Shire of Elgin : formerly a Vicarage, with the Vicar age of Kinchardine united : the Stipend of which, in 1811, Avas \u00a3150., and a glebe of about 5 acres of indifferent land : Patron, Thc Earl of Seafield : The Church is an elegant building, dedicated to St.George ; the Church-yard is well inclosed with a Avail and hedge, and a belt of wood about three yards broad. It is in the Presbytery of Aber-Nethy, and Synod of Moray. The Resident Popu lation of this Parish, in 1801, Avas 927, and, in 1811, was 988. It is 5 m. S. from GrantoAvn. The United Parishes are about 15 miles in length, and from 10 to 12 miles in breadth. The surface is much diversified with corn-fields, woods, and mountains : the soil is various ; in some parts deep, in others thin and dry, and in some wet and cold : along the banks of the Spey is a large extent of meadoAV ground, which is often overflowed : but the arable land bears only a small proportion to the uncultivated district. The Cli mate is healthy. The Roads in this Parish are remarkably good. The Gaelic language only is spoken here. There are two Heritors, The Earl of Seafield, and The Duke of Gordon; but The Earl of Moray has the Superiority of these lands. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, a rood of land, and a good School-house. Fuel is abundant. The Fir-wood of Aber- Nethy, which belongs to The Earl of Seafield, is of great extent, and of"], [93, "ABE an exceeding good quality, and very thriving. The absurd method of run-rig still prevails in a great part of this Parish. Near the Church is a large oblong square building, called Castle Roy, or Tlie Red Castle, butos which neither His tory nor Tradition give any satisfactory account. The Barony of Aber-Nethy was a part of the estate of Cumyne Lord Badenoch ; on whose forfeiture, it became a part of the Earldom of Moray. In pursuing the Boundary of the Shire of Inver ness, it appears, according to Mr. Nimmo, that the Farm of Gartenmor and its dependencies are in Inverness ; that of Rothymoon, which extends along the Spey a little more than half a mile above the mouth of the Nethy, is in the Lord ship of Aber-Nethy , which has always been considered a part of Moray. The Farms of Lettach, Larg, Drum, &c. on the East of the Nethy, are also in Moray ; that of Tulloch, on the West of the River, is in Inverness ; the inter mediate tract is mostly woody ; and the whole being the property of Grant, of Grant, Baronet (now Earl of Seafield), no Boundary line is knoAvn ; the far mers pasture in common as far, sometimes, as the river Awin. It seems, hoAv ever, most natural, according to the opinion of Mr. Grant, factor on this estate, to draw the Boundary of tlte Counties in a straight line from the March between Rothymoon and Gartenmore, parallel to the Lower part of the Nethy, South-east across the Nethy to the East of Tulloch, over the Hills of Aber-Nethy, and the Valley of Caiploch, to the summit of the mountain Dagram, situate betAveen Caiploch or Ailneg, and Glen Awin, where Ave meet the Shire of Banff. By a Memorial presented to The Commssioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, by the late Sir James Grant, in February, 1809, it appears, \" that the rapid river Nethy has its source in the Cairn Gorm Mountains, in the United Parishes of Aber- Nethy and Kinchardine, and County of Inverness, and after running about 12 miles in a Northerly direction, partly through the same county and partly through the county ofElgin, falls into the Spey a few miles above the village of Grantown. That the Public and much frequented line of road leading from the Banffshire coast to the West Sea, crosses the Nethy about a mile above its influx into the Spey. That in the year 1768, the Memorialist, at his own expense, built a stone bridge over it, which , in 1799, was carried off by the extraordinary and memorable flood that did so much damage at that time over the Northern part ofthe Kingdom.\u2014 -That the inconvenience and danger attending the want of this bridge, has been severely felt inthe intercourse of travelling between the East and West seas, the Nethy being (by sudden thaws and falls of rain, and by the gorging of ice and snow in Winter) often rendered totally impassable except by foot passengers, who are able to cross it vol. i. E"], [94, "ABE by a temporary wooden bridge erected by the Memorialist. That there are tAvo Burns or RiA-ulets, one on each side of the Nethy, viz. the Aultmore on the East, and the Dualg on the West, both often impassable for a short time during the floods. \u2014 That the Memorialist, considering the many distresses and dangers occa- sioned by the Avant of a safe communication at all times on this important line of road, and being desirous of seeing them obviated by the erection of bridges over the Nethy and the rivulets above-mentioned, had plans and estimates made out and laid before the annual County Meetings holden in April last (1808) at Inver- ness and Elgin, accompanied by Memorials craving their assistance in promoting a work of such general utility. \u2014 That these Meetings having no Funds at their OAvn disposal, and being at the same time sensible of the great importance of these bridges, were unanimous in recommending them in the strongest manner to the attention of The Honourable The Parliamentary Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges. \u2014 That the Memorialist iioav begs leave to sub- mit these recommendations to The Honourable Commissioners along with the Plan and Estimate, requesting they would order a Report to be made to them of the facts stated, and a suitable plan and estimate; and, in the event of their approv- ing of the same, the Memorialist (depending upon Subscriptions for his partial relief) Avill be ready to undertake the payment of the half of the expense. The Memorialist begs leave further to state to The Honourable Commissioners, that great inconvenience is sustained by the Public, owing to the ruinous and danger- ous state of the bridge over the water of Dorbach at Achindaar, on the road leading from Grantown to Forres. If they would be pleased to cause the person who goes to inspect and report as to the bridge over the Nethy, &c, to make out an estimate of the expense of repairing or rebuilding this bridge, and at the same time report as to its utility and the propriety of its being patronized by them, he is persuaded they will be induced to grant the usual aid ; and the Memorialist, though the bridge is not upon his own property, is also willing to pay one-half of the expense.\" \u2014 To this very liberal proposal The Commissioners, in their Fourth Report of April 1809, obsene, ** we shall hasten to comply with the desire of Sir James Grant ; and, if the Report be favourable, we shall endeavour to pro- ceed in building these bridges without delay, that the expected benefit may result from them as soon as possible.\" \u2014 In their Fifth Report of April 1811, The Commissioners state, that \" the intention of building a bridge over the Dorbach at Achindaar has since been abandoned, in consequence of making the Grantown branch of the Findhorn road, whereby an easy communication with"], [95, "ABE Forres will be accomplished, and also with Nairn, if* the Bridge at Ardelach over the river Findhorn shall be erected as proposed. Sir James Grant himself under took the other three Bridges, and the improvement of the road connecting them. In November last (1810) the work was inspected, and a very satisfactory Report was made, as Sir James Grant evidently intended to surpass the frugal stipu lations of our contracts at his own expense. The Road has been completed with more attention to levelling the inequalities of ground than could have been in sisted on, and of the Bridges only the coping of the Parapets and Water- walls then remained unfinished ; on the other hand, the masonry of the Piers, Abut ments, and Arches, is all of cut granite, which Ave had no right to expect.\" The Commissioners then most honourably and deservedly add, \" We have to lament that the country has recently sustained a great loss by the death of Sir James Grant, in the midst of these and other liberal improvements of his neighbour hood ; but, we have no reason to suppose, that his intention of improvement will not survive him.\" \u2014 The water-way ofthe bridge over the Nethy, is 84 feet ; of that over the Aultmore, is 30 feet ; and of that over the Dualg, is 15 feet. ABERNETHY, partly in the Shire of Perth, and partly in the Shire of Fife : formerly a Collegiate Church, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 22 bolls 3 firlots and 2 pecks of bear, 18 bolls of oat-meal, 1 boll 3 firlots and 2 pecks of wheat, \u00a359..15..7f in money, together with \u00a38..6..8. for Communion elements, and \u00a31..13..4. for grass : the manse, which was built in 1774, and the offices, are in good repair : the glebe consists of 4 acres : Patron, The Earl of Mansfield : The Church is remarkable for its antiquity. It is in the Presbytery of Perth, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Parish was, viz. In 1801. In 1811. For that Part, which is in the Shire of Perth. - 1355. - - 1513. For that Part, which is in the Shire of Fife. - 133. - - 122. 1488. 1635. It is 3 m.W. b. S. from Newburgh. The Fairs are holden on the 12th of February, the fourth Wednesday in May, and the second Thursday in November. This is a very ancient Town, situate near the confluence of the Earn with the Tay, and was formerly the Capital ofthe Pictish Kingdom. It is said to have been founded by Nectan the First, about the year 456, and was intended as a retreat for Sis. Bridget (who died here about 518), and nine other Virgins, who were intrc- E2"], [96, "ABE duced by St. Patrick to the Pictish Monarch. Shortly after, it was erected into an Episcopal See, and Avas the residence of the Metropolitan, if not of all Scotland, at least of that part which was subject to the Pictish Kings, during the existence of that Government. But, Avhen Kenneth the Third, King of the Scots, had entirely subdued the Picts, he translated both the Episcopal See and Metropolitan residence to St. Andrew's, in the year 518. After this, the Cathe- dral of Abernethy became a Collegiate Church, in the possession of the Culdees ; who had here an University for the education of youth. In 1273, it was changed into a Priory of Regular Canons of the Order of St. Augustine. On the 3d of August, 1476, Archibald Earl of Angus, Lord of Abernethy, gave the Town a Charter of Privileges, and was a benefactor to the Collegiate Church : this Charter was renewed by William Earl of Angus, at Holyrood' House, on the 16th of November 1628, and by which, the government of Abernethy is vested in tAvo Baillies, and fifteen Counsellors. It is a Burgh of Barony, of which Lord Douglas, as representative of the heiress of Abernethy, is Superior. Here is a considerable manufacture of linen cloth. The Salary of the Parochial School, including perquisites as Session Clerk, is upAvardsof \u00a317., together with School- fees, a good house, the Interest of \u00a3190, and \u00a31..13..4. from a mortification for teaching poor Scholars. In the Church-yard, is one of those remarkable Round Towers, of Avhich the one at Brechin is the only Tower of a similar construction in Scotland : it is 74 feet in height, and 48 feet in circumference : Mr. Grose has presened two Views of it. The Parish of Abernethy is about 5 miles in length, and about 4 miles in breadth, a considerable part of it being situate in the Ocliil Hills. The soil is principally clay, and tolerably productive. The air is salubrious. The ancient servitudes, so oppressive and harassing to the farmer, are almost entirely abolished. There are two passage Boats on the Earn ; one of them at Cary, which is seldom employed ; and the other at Ferry-field, upon the estate of Carpow, which being near the junction of the Earn and the Tay, the boat belonging to it is often employed, in transport- ing passengers over the Tay to the Carse of Gowrie. There are usually 20 boats, each with two men, employed in fishing during the season. The Roads, and Bridges, are in bad repair. About a mile and a half East from the Town, a little below the Mansion-house of Carpow, stood the ancient Castle which belonged to the Lords of Abernethy, in 1320 ; and which came by marriage to the Earls of Angus, and is now vested in the person of Lord Douglas, who annually receives the feus of many neighbouring estates, as well as of most of the Town"], [97, "ABO of Abernethy. In the South West extremity, among the hills, stands Balvaird Castle, which belonged to the Murrays, of Balvaird, in the reign of Robert the Second; and is now the property of The Earl of Mansfield, the lineal and worthy descendant of that Illustrious House, and to whom it gives the title of Baron.

This Parish contains about 1600 acres. The lower grounds are light, dry, and fertile ; but the more elevated lands are of a loose, poor, and gravelly soil. Great improvements in agriculture have lately been made here. The air is dry, and cold. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a house, and garden. Upon the summit of a hill, called Glenny-Law, are two cairns, which are said to have been raised in consequence of a battle between two powerful Families, the Grays of Foulis, and the Boyds of Pitkindie, in which the latter were victorious. There are also the remains of two Druidical circles. ABER-RUTHVEN, in the Shire of Perth : an ancient Vicarage, now comprehended in the Parish of Auchterarder. It is 2 m. N. E. from Auchterarder.

The cultivated part of these Parishes extends 4 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth, along both sides of the river Dee; but the Mountains and Forest of Glen-Tanar extend nearly 10 miles further, and are covered with extensive woods of excellent oak. The soil is sandy and thin, particularly on the banks ofthe Dee, where, in dry seasons, the crop is very scanty. The Earl of Aboyne is proprietor of five-sixths of the Parish, and is frequently resident at the Castle, which is surrounded by about 400 acres, all inclosed and highly cultivated. Aboyne gives the Title of Ea rl to the Ancient and Illustrious Family of Gordon, one of the Sixteen Peers for North Britain, in the Imperial Parliament.

This was a Roman Station, on Gryme's Dyke ; and, in May 1771, as the workmen were carrying on the great Forth and Clyde Canal near this Fort, they discovered four altars, a mutilated Bust, a broken Altar, and two great iron mallets. All these things were found in the tract of the Canal, about nine feet below the surface of the earth ; and in a pit which appeared to be about seven feet diameter at the top, and three at the bottom. The inscriptions upon the Altars inform us, that they were erected by a Centurion of the Second Legion. General Roy has given a plan of this Fort in plate 35., and in plate 38., engrav ings of the several antiquities. ACHLOUCHRY, EAST, v. TANNADICE. ACHMORE, v. WEEM.

AIGASH, ISLAND, in the Shire of Inverness ; and in the Parish of Kill tarlaty. It is 5\\ m. S. W. from Beauly. This small, but beautiful Island, is formed by the river Beauly, which here divides into tAvo branches : ii is of an oval figure, and about a mile and a half in circumference. It is principally formed of a rock of pudding-stone, rising in an abrupt manner about 100 feet above the level of the Avater : it is covered with natural Avood, and affords good pasturage for sheep, goats, and a few Highland cows, during the summer and hanest. Upon the river, near the Eastern extremity of the Island, is a Saw mill, where a timber manufacture has been carried on ever since the year 1765. AIKERNESS, v. EVIE. AIKY-BRAE, v. DEER, NEW.

This is a very beautiful, uninhabited Island, about two miles in circumference, and rising to a stupendous height, in a conical form. Its summit is covered with heath, and a little grass ; and is stocked with rabbits, and a feAV goats. During the season of incubation, it is frequented by countless numbers of aquatic birds. It is the property of The Earl of Cassilis, who lets it at about \u00a330. per annum : the tenants paying their rent by the feathers of the sea fowl, and the skins of the rabbits.

It is in the Presbytery of Stirling, and in the Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 1855, and, in 1811, was 1703. It is 5\\ m. N. from Falkirk. This Parish is 6 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth, extending along the banks ofthe Forth. The Avhole Parish is a plain, with the exception ofthe Hills of Airth, and Dunmore : the soil is, in general, a strong clay, abun dantly fertile ; and it is believed, that a great part of the Ioav ground, near the river, once made part of its bed, as many sea-shells are mingled with the earth. The Climate is healthful. The Parish is intersected from West to East by a small river, which takes its rise in St. Ninian's, and discharges itself into the Forth, at Higgin's Neuck : stream tides flow in this rivulet upwards of a mile from its entrance ; and in heavy rains, it is subject to inundations : there are five stone bridges over it, one of Avhich is on the Public road, leading from the Villages of Dunmore and Airth, to Carron and Falkirk : this is called The Abbey- Totvn Bridge, which name corroborates an opinion entertained by many persons, that"], [103, "ALB there was formerly an Abbey at Airth, subordinate to the Abbey of Holyrood- House ; and that this Bridge acquired that name, from its being the direct road to the Abbey Town : it also appears, from several old writings, that the Parish of Airth belonged to the Bishop of Edinburgh, during the times of Episcopacy. The Hills of Airth and Dunmore abound Avith free-stone, and coal of an excel lent quality. There are tAvo well known and much frequented Ferries in the Parish, viz., The Ferries of Kersie, and Higgin's Neuck : the former is about half a mile in breadth, and is the property of John Francis Erskine, Esq. of Marr, who has lately built a Pier on each side of the river, which renders it commodious for passengers, and all kinds of carriages, either at high or low water : \u2014 the latter is about a mile in breadth. There is a Passage boat once a day, from Airth and Dunmore to Alva, and the places opposite ; its time of departure varies according to the tide. There are three Harbours, viz. Airth, Dunmore, and New-Mill, all of which are within the precincts of the Custom house at Alloa : and at each of them, vessels are occasionally built. The Master of the Parochial School has a dwelling-house, and legal Salary of 300 merks allowed him by the Heritors. There are three ancient ToAvers at Airth, Dun more, and Powfouls : the first, which is in good repair, is called Wallace's Tower, and makes part of the House of Airth, the property of James Graham, Esq. AIT,HSTING, in the Mainland, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shetland : formerly a Vicarage, constituting part of the Union of Sandsting. The Bay of Aith affords very fine anchorage for many miles.

A Roman Station, situate on the banks of the small river Allan, about a mile above its confluence with the Forth. According to Mr. Chalmers, the Alauna com manded the lower parts of Strath-Allan, with the whole country for a consi derable distance on both the banks ofthe Forth and Teith; having communica tions with Camelon behind, Lindum before, and with subsidiary posts on those rivers aboA*e. ALBANY, or ALBAN, the ancient name of a mountainous District, which comprehended Breadalbane, Athol, a small part of Lochaber, with Appin, and Glenurchay.

ALD CAMUS, in the Shire of Berwick : an ancient Vicarage, Hoav com prehended in the Parish of Cockburn's-Path: The Church, which was dedi cated to St. Helen, stood near the Sea-shore, and its ruins are still called St. Helen's Kirk. It Avas a ruin before the year 1770. The General Post-Office, Avhich was formerly here, is now removed to the Pi-ess. It is situate upon the German Ocean, at the distance of 6 miles N.W. from Press. See Cockburn's- Path. ALDCATHIE, in the Shire of Linlithgow : an ancient Parish, annexed after the Reformation to the Parish of Dalmenie : The Church is in ruins. This Parish is separated from Dalmenie by the intervention of the Parishes of Aber corn, and Kirk-Liston. The lands of Aldcathie are, from East to West, about a mile and a half in length ; and, from North to South, nearly a mile in breadth. They lie about 4 miles East from Linlithgow ; partly upon the South, and partly upon the North, of the great Road between Linlithgow and Edinburgh. The situation is elevated, and the soil is in general a poor clay, and the harvest late. The Earl of Hopeton is proprietor. See, Dalmenie. ALDERNEY, ISLAND, in the English Channel. This is a verdant little Island, about 8 miles in circuit, and is fruitful both in corn, and pasture : it is remarkable for its fine breed of milch coavs ; of Avhich, hoAvever, the number is small. It is about 70 miles South West from The Isle of Wight, and is sepa rated from the Cape de la Hogue, in Normandy, by a narroAV Strait, called The Race of Alderney, which is a very dangerous Passage in stormy weather when the two currents meet ; otherwise it is safe, and has depth of Water for the largest ships. Through this Strait the French fleet made their escape, after their defeat off la Hogue by Admiral Russell, in 1692. It is a healthy Island, and contains upwards ol\" 1000 Inhabitants, who all live together in one Town of the same name. It has only one Church. The Harbour, which is a consider able distance from the ToAvn to the Soutlvward, is called Crabby, and is only fit for small vessels. To the Westward lie the range of rocks, called The Caskets, so dangerous to mariners, and upon which the son of Henry the First was lost, and at a later period, His Majesty's Ship Victory. It is noAV furnished with a Light-house. This Island is supposed to be the Arica, of Antoninus. It is in the Latitude of 49\u00b0 50' North, and the Longitude of 2\u00b0 17' West from Greenwich. It is a dependance on the Island of Guernsey ; and is in the Diocese of Win chester."], [105, "ALF ALDHAM, in the Shire of Hadington: an ancient Parish, hoav compre hended in the Parish of White-Kirk : The ruins of the ancient Church, which stood on the Sea-cliff in the Northern extremity of the Parish, Avere apparent, in 1770, but Avere soon after removed for some domestic purpose. This Parish only contained the lands of Aldham, and Scougal. It is 3 m. E.S.E. from North Berwick. See, White-Kirk. ALDIE, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Fossaway. It is 6 m. S. W. from Kinross. The Castle of Aldie, which was built in the Sixteenth Century, is the Family Seat of the Mercers ; but is fast going into disrepair. In the middle of a rising ground, called Carleith, are the ruins of an old building, perfectly circular, and nearly 24 feet in diameter ; but no satisfactory account is given of its original use. The Barony of Aldie, which anciently belonged to the Earl of Tullibardine, was given as a portion with the beautiful Lady Aldia Murray, who was married to William Mercer, Laird of Meikleour, a brave and generous man ; and who, in the times of feudal aristocracy, strongly sup ported the Chieftain of the Murrays. Hence the Barony received its name from the Lady ; and the Mercers, upon that occasion, assumed the Mullet of the Murrays, as a part of their arms ; and there has been a very close friendship betAveen the two families ever since. ALFORD, in the District of Alford, and Shire of Aberdeen : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend ofwhich, in 1811, was 2 chalders of meal, one chalder of bear, and \u00a360..13..4. in money : the manse was built in 1718 : the glebe consists of 4 acres, and a garden : Patron, The Crown : The Church is old. It is in the Presbytery of Alford, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 644, and, in 1811, was 718. It is 123 m. N. from Edin burgh. A General Post-Office is established here. This Parish is situate along the banks of the river Don, and contains about 8000 Scotch acres ; of Avhich, 4000 are arable, 3000 hill, muir, and moss, and 1000 of flourishing plantations. The soil is in general a good light loam, and tolerably productive, but the crops are precarious, and agriculture is in its infancy here. Fuel is expensive. Game is abundant. The Salary of the Parochial School is 13 bolls of meal, and \u00a32. arising from a mortification, together with School-fees and perquisites, a dwell ing, and a rood of land. On the 2d of July 1645, The Marquis of Montrose obtained a victory here over Baillie, one of the Generals of The Covenanters. By the Fifth Report of The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, it appears, that a Memorial was presented to them by John Farquharson, Esq.,"], [106, "ALL of Haughton, in May 1810, stating, that at a Meeting holden at Aberdeen it was agreed by the landed proprietors, that a Bridge should be erected over the river Don at \" The Boat of Forbes,\" as there it would answer every purpose of unit- ing the Upper country Avith the Aberdeen Turnpike road, Avould exactly answer for the Brechin and Huntley road, and at present would cross the Don where General Wade's line of road crosses that river; \u2014 and craving the aid of The Commissioners, which being complied with to the extent of one moiety of the estimated expense, the contract Avas undertaken by Mr. Farquharson himself, in order that it might be finished by the end of the year 1811, and Avhose interest was materially concerned in its speedy completion. This bridge consists of three arches, the total Water-way being 128 feet. A road to connect the Potarch Bridge and Alford Bridge by crossing that ridge of the Grampians which di vides the Dee and the Don, and joining the Alford Turnpike road at Clunes, was also proposed to The Commissioners ; But, it appears to make a consider able angle to the Eastward, and is not the best practicable line of communication. ALFRAIG, a District, in the Shire of Ross, abounding with Fir Woods. ALGRISTON HEAD, a Promontory, on the West Coast of the Shire of Ross. A LIMITE, of Richard of Cirencester, from Camelon, before the Wall of Antoninus. ALLAN, PORT, v. SORBIE. ALLAN, PORT, \u2022: WHITEHORN.

This Village is beautifully situate on the banks of the river Allan, which, Avithin a short space, drives several corn and paper mills ; and has also an extensive Brewery. It is situate in a plentiful country, near coals, and at the separation of the two great Military Roads, lead ing to the North, and West of Scotland.

ALLOA, or ALLOW AY, in the Shire of Clackmannan : formerly a Vicar age, with the ancient Parish of Tullibody united ; the Stipend of which, in 181 1,"], [107, "ALL was 11 chalders of victual, half meal, and half bear, payable at the rate of the Fiar prices of Clackmannan, \u00a38..6..8. for Communion elements, and \u00a371..3..2. Scotch, Vicarage, paid as use and wont, part of it being paid by a number of persons out of the neighbouring Parishes ; together with two carts of coals per week, Craig leave, i. e. paying for the Collier's labour : the manse is beautifully situate at the head of John Street, and has a garden adjoining of about half an acre : the glebe is about 11 Scotch acres, of fertile land : Patron, The Crown : The Church, which is too small, and incommodious, is an old building, dedicated to St. Mungo. It is in the Presbytery of Stirling, and Synod of Perth and Stir ling. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (comprising the Town of Alloa, Coal Bridge, and Glass Work, the Country, the Villages of Tullibody and Cambus, and The Colliery) was 5214, and, in 1811, was 5096. It is 31 m. W. N. W. from Edinburgh. The Markets are holden on Wednesday, and Satur day. The Fairs are on the second Wednesdays of February, May, August, and November. The situation of the Town is uncommonly beautiful, on the North ern bank ofthe Forth. A General Post-Office is established here ; from whence a Post has been extended to Kincardine, and from thence to Culross, Dunferm lin, and The Ferries. The water in the Harbour rises, at Neap tides, from 12 to 15 feet, and, at Spring tides, from 17 to 22 feet : the Quay is built of r< ugh hewn stone, in a substantial manner : it runs within the land, and forms a Pow ox small Creek, where the rivulet, which Aoavs through the North-East end of the Town, falls into the Forth : the Potv has lately been considerably widened, and by an Act of Parliament, a small duty is laid on the anchorage, for support and improvement of the harbour. A, little above the Harbour, is an excellent dry Dock, capable of receiving vessels of great burden : and above this Dock, is a Ferry, Avhich is sometimes called Tlte Craig Ward, and sometimes The King's Ferry, where two very complete Piers have been built, one on each side of the river ; which renders it an easy, safe, and commodious passage, at all times of the tide : the breadth of the River here, at high tide, is above half a mile : Mr. Erskine has feued out ground for a New Town, between John Street and Tlie Ferry, on a beautiful field, and a regular plan ; it promises to be an airy, healthy place, and is excellently calculated for those who are concerned in busi ness at the Harbour. The Port of Alloa comprehends not only the Town of Alloa, but also the Creeks of Clackmannan, Kennet Pans, Kincardine, Cambus, and Manor, on the North side of the River ; and Airth, Dunmore, or Elphin stone, and Fallin, on the South, together with the shore of Stirling : The exports"], [108, "ALL and imports are very considerable. The Excise is conducted by a Supervisor, and 4 Officers. There is only one Sheriff-Depute for this, and the neighbouring County of Stirling : he appoints his Substitutes, and one of them constantly resides here, who keeps his Courts in this ToAvn. The Quarter Sessions, and other Public Meetings either by the Justices of the Peace, or Sheriff, are holden in the Shire Town of Clackmannan, about two miles distant. A Baron Baillie is named by the Proprietor of the Estate of Man; who decides on Petty offences, and debts not exceeding 40s. ; and who also regulates the stents and cesses, and other matters of Police within the ToAvn and Barony. The Admiralty Court has been long discontinued. A large manufactory of Glass, an iron Foundery, a Tannery, and a Tile and Brick work, all contribute to the commerce ofthe Town. Here is a numerous and flourishing School, ably conducted by a Rector and Doctor (i.e. a Master, and Usher), both of whom have .very good apartments: the Rector takes Boarders, and discharges his important trust, Avith the greatest assiduity and honour. The late pious and benevolent Lady Charlotte Erskine left \u00a3300. Sterling for educating poor children, and having them catechised on Sunday Evenings : Her Ladyship also bequeathed \u00a3400. to.vards assisting the tAvo Schools in the Colliery, which are there established, in order to accommodate what are called The Upper and Lower Works, i. e. Tlte Colly land, and Alloa: all these Schools are well attended, and promise much public benefit. On a rock, a little above the Harbour, is The Tower of Alloa, which Avas built about the Thirteenth Century : in 1461, the Ancient and Noble Family of Erskine, who were originally settled in the Shire of Renfrew, succeeded by a female to the Earldom of Marr ; but it was not until the year 1561, that they got possession of it ; when it was declared in Parliament, that, in justice, the Earl- dom of Marr belonged to John Lord Erskine, who, in the year 1571, was elected Regent of Scotland, on the death of The Earl of Lennox : how honour- ably he filled that troublesome station, is amply recorded by all the Scottish Historians. The Family of Erskine have also been often honoured with having their Infant Sovereigns entrusted to their care, particularly King James the Fifth, the unfortunate Queen Mary, James the Sixth, and his son Prince Henry : which sacred charge they most faithfully performed : and the worthy Representative ofthis Family still retains many Memorials of the affection, which subsisted between the Royal House of Stuart and his Ancestors : Mr. Erskine has repaired the House, and made great improvements in the pleasure grounds, and the Estate. The Parish of Alloa contains about 3900 acres : the surface"], [109, "A L M is agreeably diversified, and on the banks of the Forth, and the Devon, the soil is very fertile. Agriculture is much attended to here. The rents ofthe Barony of Alloa are wholly paid in money, except a few kain, Avhich are paid over and above the stipulated rent : and the tenants also pay half of the cess, or land tax. This Parish has long been famous for its fine coal mines. The principal Heritor ofthe Parish is John Francis Erskine, Esq., of Marr : he resides almost always at Alloa ; and pays the greatest attention to every scheme of improvement and police. All kinds of Personal Services from Tenants may be said to be abolished here, as those on the estate of Tullibody axe seldom or never exacted. The Feuers in the Town are obliged to assist, in case of any accident at the Dam head of Gartmorn. The Family of Marr draw custom for goods passing through the Town, as they are obliged to keep the streets in repair. The roads are bad. The Church being very incommodious, the Heritors have been strongly encouraged to rebuild it, by a donation of \u00a31200. made by the late excellent Lady Charlotte Erskine ; who also bequeathed \u00a3800. Sterling, the interest whereof to be applied for the establishment of an Assistant Minister, whose In come, including the rents of some houses, left for the same purpose by Mr. Johnstone, noAV exceeds \u00a370. per annum. ALLOWAY, in the District of Kyle, and Shire of Ayr : an ancient Parish, now united to the Parish of Ayr, and its Church has been permitted to fall to ruins. It is situate near the river, at a short distance from the bridge of Doon, on the road leading from Maybole to Ayr. This is one ofthe oldest Par ishes in Scotland, and the Minister of Ayr is still obliged to marry and baptise in it, and also to hold here his Parochial Catechisings. The Magistrates at tempted, some time ago, to take away the Bell, but were repulsed by the inhab itants. Mr. Grose has preserved a vieAV of the Church ; which Avas famous, according to the vulgar opinion, for being the place where the witches and war locks used to hold their nocturnal meetings. Mr. Burns has given us a Tale on this subject, styled *' Tam O'Shanter.\" \u2014 This truth sand honest Tam O'Shanter, As he frae Ayr ae night did canter ; (Auld Ayr, whom ne'er a town surpasses For honest men, and bonnie lasses). \u2014 ALMOND, CASTLE, in the Shire of Stirling, and in the Parish of Muir- Avon-Side. It is 3 m. E. b. S. from Falkirk. This Castle is situate on an vol. i. G"], [110, "ALT > eminence about half a mile South from the great Road leading from Linlithgow to Stirling. It consists of tAvo old ToAvers, Avith a modern addition at the East end. This was formerly a Seat ofthe Earls of Callander. It is now, together Avith the Barony, the property of William Forbes, Esq. Mr. Grose has pre served a view of it. ALNESS, in the Shire of Ross : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend ofwhich, in 1811, was 128 bolls of victual, \u00a336..10..0.

This Parish is about 12 miles in length, and from 2 to 4 miles in breadth, stretching along the Northern coast ofthe Firth of Cromarty. Contig uous to the sea shore, the land is mostly arable, and ofa light soil ; the remainder being mountainous, and principally appropriated to pasturage. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School -fees, and perquisites. In the higher districts ofthe Parish, The Society for propagating Christian Know ledge have established two Schools ; one for instructing children in reading, writing, and arithmetic, and the other for teaching young girls to spin, sew, and knit Stockings. The Gaelic is the language commonly spoken here. On the property of Mr. Andrew Munro, of Leialdie, is a rich vein of iron ore, and of considerable extent. Navar, the family Seat of the amiable General Sir Hector Munro, K. B., is the most complete and finished place in the North of Scotland. Teaninich, the family residence of Captain Hugh Munro, is also a fine Seat. ALTIVAIG, ISLAND, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness : it constitutes part ofthe Parish of Killmuir, and is appropriated to the pasturage of Sheep. The Harbour here has good ground for anchorage ; but, being open to the Northern Sea, it is judged rather unsafe. ALTYRE, in the Shire of Elgin : an ancient Parish, formerly belonging to the Parsonage of Dallas, but annexed to Rafford by Act of Parliament, in 1661. The Walls of the old Church remain entire, which, until Mr. Cumming lately erected a new Tomb, had been the burying-place of his Ancestors for time immemorial. The Cummings, of Logie, who are a branch ofthis family, and most of the ancient Residenters, still continue to bury here. The soil of Altyre is generally thin, but sharp and productive. It commands a prodigious extent of hill and pasturage, and the peat-mosses are inexhaustible. The present"], [111, "A L V Proprietor, Colonel Alexander Penrose Cumming, the reputed Chief of that name, has brought his farm into the highest order, and has planted about 1000 acres with fir and other forest trees, which are in a flourishing state. It is 2\\ m. S. from Forres. ALVA, in the Shire of Stirling, though locally situate in the Shire of Clack- mannan : formerly a Mensal Church, belonging to the See of Dunkeld : the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a323..14..5|* Sterling in money, including the allowance for Communion elements, together Avith 21^ bolls of bear, and 42-f- bolls of meal, together with \u00a360.. 19..

It is in the Presbytery of Stirling, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Popu- lation of this Parish, in 1801, was 787, and, in 1811, was 909. It is 3 m. N. from Alloa. This Parish is about 4 miles in length, and about 2\\ miles in breadth, extending over a considerable portion of the Ochil Hills, and the valley on the banks ofthe river Devon: the sides ofthe hills are clothed with verdure, and afford a rich pasture to great numbers of sheep; the arable soil, which is all inclosed, is partly a rich mould intermixed with gravel, partly clay, and partly haugh lands, that are frequently overflowed by the Devon. A manufactory of Scotch blankets and serges has long been earned on here, and two Avoollen mills have lately been established. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, and perquisites. This Parish has been distinguished by the discoveries that have been made, in this part ofthe Ochils, of various metals, and particu- larly of silver : ofwhich Lord Alva, in 1767, caused a pair of Communion cups to be made, for the use ofthe Church. Extensive veins of coal are noAv worked here. The House of Alva, the elegant residence of Mr. Johnstone, is situate on an eminence, projecting from the base of the Wood-Hill, Avhich is about 220 feet above the beautiful Avater of Devon : the plantations are in a flourishing state, and immediately behind the house, the hill rises to the additional height of 1400 feet; from the summit ofwhich, the prospect is most extensiAe, and beautiful. A new line of Road has lately been carried through the Parish, on each side of which a new row of Houses has been erected. ALVAH, in the Shire of Banff : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 58 bolls 2 firlots 2 pecks of oat-meal, 5 bolls 2 firlots of bear, \u00a3600.

George Sangster, and the Avhole inclosed ; the manse Avas built in 1764: Patron, The Earl of Fife : The Church, which is very old, and in bad repair, is dedicated to St. Durstan. It is in the Presbytery of Turrets, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, Avas 1057, and, in 1811, Avas 991. It is 2\\ m. S. from Banff. This Parish is about 6 miles in length, and its greatest breadth is about the same, but in some places it is only from two to three miles broad. The Doveron enters this Parish about a mile below Forglen, the Seat of the late Lord Banff, and, after many beau tiful windings through a very fertile valley, leaves it about tAvo miles from the sea: about half a mile beloAV the Church, the river is contracted by two steep and rugged precipices, which are commonly denominated The Craigs of Alvah, where it measures about 50 feet in depth. The scenery, Avhich is naturally bold and picturesque, has been greatly embellished by its Noble proprietor, The Earl of Fife, by thriving plantations, and a magnificent arch, Avhich unites both sides of the river, and forms an easy communication betAveen the opposite parts of His Lordship's extensive Park. The soil on the sides ofthe river is fertile, but sub ject to frequent inundations : as we recede towards the West, the country becomes more hilly and barren : of these eminences, one ofthe most conspicuous is The Hill of Alvah, which rises from the bed ofthe river to a great height, and serves as a common Land-mark to mariners, on their approach to the coast. The air is in general dry, and healthy. A few bridges have been built over the most dangerous passes, and the roads are tolerable. At the Farm of Bog of Mount- Blairie, are the remains of an old Castle, situate in a swamp, which is noAV over grown with Alders, and is said to have been erected by Tlie Earl of Buchan : And, on an eminence above it, are the ruins ofa Chapel ; adjoining to which, is a Well, that was famed of old ' for its sovereign charms,' but is now fallen into disrepute.

This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and nearly the same in breadth ; it is washed by the Moray Firth on the North. The surface presents an agreeable mixture of hill and dale ; and the Plantations lately made by The Earl of Moray, will soon add much to its beauty. The soil is distin-"], [113, "A L V guished for its fertility, being generally a deep loam on a bottom of clay ; though, in a feAV places, it is of a lighter quality : the crops, however, are rather late, but from the mildness of the climate, this is attended with no material incon- venience to the Farmer. The rents are paid partly in money, and partly in grain. The East end of the Parish abounds with inexhaustible Quarries of excellent free-stone. The peat mosses being now almost exhausted, many ofthe Inhabit- ants are obliged to purchase coals. The County road, from Elgin to Forres, passes through this Parish. The Salary ofthe Schoolmaster is 10 bolls of bear, and \u00a333..6..8. Scotch, together Avith some small perquisites, and a rood ofland : And, in 1715, George Duncan, late Merchant in Inverness, mortified 3000 merks for the benefit of this School ; the interest of which is applied to the education of six Boys, not above ten years of age, each of them enjoying this benefaction for four years ; these Bursars are named by the Minister, and the Kirk Session.

Bushy, from its being much interspersed with Copses : its form is irregular : the principal inhabited division stretches along the river Spey, for about 10 miles in length, and from one to two miles in breadth, and through which the great Road runs from Inverness, and Fort George, to Edinburgh : here the soil is light and dry, on a sandy gravel, producing heavy crops of corn in wet seasons, but is exceedingly parched in dry weather. Near the centre of the Parish the river Fessie falls into the Spey from the South, direct along which lies the second Division of the Parish, extending Southward 6 miles, and from half a mile to two miles in breadth ; but including the hills, which are extremely barren, the Parish extends from North to South upwards of twenty miles. The climate is dry, and healthy. There is only one place of Worship noAv, (though there were formerly several"], [114, "A L Y Chapels) and that is in the extremity of the Parish : But the Incumbent fre quently preaches in the Kirk of Inch, as being more contiguous to the greater part of the Parishioners than the Parish-Church. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and some small perquisites. Tliere is also a Society Schoolmaster, with a Salary of \u00a35. as Catechist, from a mortification in the Parish, and \u00a39. from the Society. There is a Loch that surrounds the glebe, about a mile in length, and from an eighth to half a mile in breadth, which contains white and red trouts of a good flavour. On the estate of Raits, is a large artificial Cave : and on each side of the High-road, are a number of Tumuli. An elegant modern mansion has been built here, named Belleville, by the late James Macpherson, Esq., translator ofthe Poems attributed to Ossian : he died in Scotland, on the 17th of February, 1796, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. At no great distance from Loch Alvie is the burial place of the Chief of the Macphersons. By decreets of valuation pro duced to the Teind Office, in 1811, it appears, that the Teinds of The Duke of Gordon, Macpherson of Belleville, and Macpherson of Inverishie, are \u00a374.. 15. .0. And that the Teind, on the rent ofthe Laird of Macintosh's land given up upon old leases at \u00a3160.. 3.. 2., is - 32.. 0,.7-f \u00a3106..15..7-j- But, as Mr. Macintosh, of Macintosh, does not appear to have got a valuation, the real extent of his Teind is not known. ALYTH, partly in the Shire of Perth, and partly in the Shire of Forfar : formerly a Prebend, belonging to the Bishop of Dunkeld ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 6 chalders 11 bolls 2 firlots 1 peck If lippie of victual, two thirds ofwhich are meal, and one-third bear, \u00a339..17..4| in money, and about \u00a31..10..0. for small Tythes : the manse is in decent repair: the glebe consists of 6 acres of good land : The Crown, and The Family of Airly, claim the Pat ronage : The Church is an old Gothic structure, and is in good condition. It is in the Presbytery of Meigle, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of this Parish was, In 1801. In 1811. For that part, which is in the Shire of Perth. - 2397 - 2388.

The Village of Alyth was erected into a Burgh of Barony, by a Charter from James the Third: the whole of it belongs in Superiority to The Earl of Airly, Avho has a large and valuable Estate in this part ofthe Parish, which has long been in the possession of that Noble Family. It is pleasantly situate on the banks ofa small rivulet, and carries on an extensive trade in the Linen manufacture. The land in the Barony, near the Village, is let out in two or three acres, for the convenience of the Inhabitants, and is rented at from 30s. to 40s. per acre. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a School, and Dwelling on a larger scale than usual ; and also the Interest of \u00a340. Sterling, bequeathed by The Rev. Mr. Robertson, a late Incumbent, for the education of a few children of his name. The Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge have likewise established a School at Drums ork, in Black Lunnans, with a Salary of \u00a316. Sterling, and which is attended with singular advantage to that remote corner of the Parish. \u2014 The Parish of Alyth is about 12 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth, stretching along the Northern side of the Vale of Strathmore. That part of it which is situate upon the banks of the Isla, is flat and extremely fertile, but subject to frequent inundations : towards the North, it is hilly, but very productive. The most considerable mountains are those of Mount Blair, and King-Seat, which are covered with verdure, and afford pasture to a great number of sheep ; and the side ofthe latter is, in many parts, cloathed with a beautiful natural wood. Agriculture is much attended to here. Beyond the hill of Banff, is The Forest of Alyth, a large tract of heath ground, consisting of upwards of 6000 acres, and which affords pasture for a considerable number of sheep, and black cattle : here are very extensive mosses, which supply the adjacent country with fuel : it abounds in game, especially muir-fowl, and is much frequented in the shooting season. At the extremity of the Parish, there is a beautiful little country, surrounded with liills, and inter sected by Tlie Black Water or Ericht, which in summer has a delightful appear ance : that part of it, connected with this Parish, is called The Black Lunnans, and lies in the Shire of Forfar. The Family of Bamff, represented by Sir William Ramsay, Bart., have Charters of the Estate which they now possess, since the reign of King Alexander the Second, in the year 1232."], [116, "iNC AMISFIELD, in the Shire of Hadington; and in the Parish of Hadington. The Lands and Houses here formerly belonged to a Company of Manufacturers, which being purchased by Colonel CHARTERls,he changed the name from New- Mills to Amisfield, in honour of the very ancient family in Nithisdale, from which he Avas descended. It is now a beautiful Seat of The Earl of Wemyss ; and in the Gallery are many fine pictures, some of them by the first Masters, in particular, \" Vertumnus and Pomona,\" by Rubens, and for AvhichHis Lordship is said to have refused Eight Hundred Guineas. AMISFIELD HOUSE, v. TINWALD. AMULRIE, in the Shire of Perth. This is a small Village, situate on the great Military Road from Stirling to Inverness, by Crieff, from Avhich it is about 11 miles distant to the NortfiAvard. A great Fair is holden here, on the first Wednesday in May. This District is 12 miles distant from the Parish of Dull, to which it belongs ; and is furnished with a Missionary, who is supported by The Committee for managing the Royal Bounty. It is Avatered by the river Bran. ANCRUM, or ALN-CROM, i. e. The Bend ofthe River Ain, in the Dis trict of Jedburgh, and Shire of Roxburgh : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, Avas \u00a3167. per annum: but the Minister enjoys no part of the Stipend, which Avas paid to the Minister of Lang-NeAvton before its annexation : Patron, Sir John Scott: The Church is in good repair. It is in the Presbytery of Jedburgh, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of the United Parishes of Ancrum, and Lang-Newton, in 1801, was 1222, and, in 1811, Avas 1309. It is 3f m. N. N. W. from Jedburgh. This Parish extends about 5 miles in length upon the North side of the river Teviot, which divides it from the Parishes of Jedburgh and Bedrule ; and is in breadth about 4 miles. The soil, in the loAver grounds, is rich, and Avell cultivated. The Name of the Village is exactly descriptive of its situation on the South side of the riA*er Ain, noAV called the Ale, where it runs in a curve or crooked direction, and the adjacent banks, to Avhich the Village approaches, exhibit the side of an ellipsis. The Parish of Lang-Newton was annexed to that of Ancrum, at the end ofthe Seventeenth Century, and forms the North-West and part of the North side of the present Parish. The river Ale, issuing from the Loch of that name in the County of Selkirk, takes its course through this Parisii from West to East separating, as is supposed, the old Parish of Lang-Newton ; and discharges itself into the Teviot at the distance of half a mile below the Village, and a quarter of a mile above Ancrum Bridge, on the great Road to Jedburgh : this river, over which there are two Bridges, abounds with excellent trout, and"], [117, "ANC affords better sport to the angler than any other in this District. The site of Ancrum House is exceedingly picturesque. The Salary of the Schoolmaster has lately been augmented by the Heritors, who have built a School-house larger and more commodious than in any other country Parish in this Presbytery. Here are several Quarries of free-stone. The Roman Road, from York to the Firth of Forth, after passing through the North-East part ofthe Parish of Jedburgh, cuts a small part of the North corner of Ancrum : upon the top and declivity of the Hill, Eastward, on the border ofthe Parish of Maxton, the vestiges ofa Roman camp may still be traced : the ridge in the Parish of Ancrum, over which the present Road to Edinburgh passes, is at the distance of about half a mile West of the line of the Roman Road ; it is called Liliard's Edge, from a Lady of that name, who, upon an invasion of the English during the Regency of The Earl of Arran, foughtwith masculine bravery, and fell under many wounds upon this spot, which is consecrated to her memory. The most venerable fragment of antiquity in the Parish, is the Maltan Wall or Walls, upon a rising ground at the bottom ofthe Village of Ancrum, close to the side of the river, where it turns its course towards the South- East. These Walls were strongly built of stone and lime, in the figure ofa parallelogram, and, ascending on one side from the plain adjacent to the river, were considerably higher than the summit of the Hill Avhich they inclose ; but are now levelled with its surface, and a small part of them only remain : vaults or subterraneous arches have been discovered in the neighbouring ground, and underneath the area inclosed by the building : human bones are still found by persons ploughing or digging in the plain at the side of the river : The Name, which these Walls still retain, gives the colour of authenticity to a tradition generally received in this part of the country, that the Building, and surrounding Fields, had been vested in the Knights of Malta, or Knights Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem, who, on account of their splendid achievements and merito rious services in the Holy Wars, had acquired property even in the most remote Dominions of Christendom. On the banks of the Ale, beloAV the House of An crum, there were several Caves or Recesses, and not less than fifteen may still be pointed out: in some of them there are vestiges of chimnies or sire-places, and holes for the passage of smoke from the back part of the cave to the outside of the bank: these caverns, itis thought, were originally intended for places of concealment and shelter, or assumed by the poorer classes for places of habitation. The Barony of Ancrum was formerly comprehended in the Regal ity of Glasgow. Ancrum gives the title of Earl to The Marquis and Earl of Lothian. VOL. I.

KIRK ANDREAS. ANDREWS, ST., v. CUTHBERT'S, ST. ANDREWS, ST., a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the District of St. AndreAv's, and Shire of Fife : a Collegiate Charge, both Ministers officiating in one Church, which appears to have been built in the year 1112: The King is Patron ofthe First Charge, to which the Parochial Stipend belongs, being, in 1811, 14 bolls 2 pecks of wheat, 63 bolls 3 firlots 2 pecks If lippie of oats, and 65 bolls 3 firlots of bear, together with a glebe of 4 acres, but no manse : The Magistrates and Town-Council are Patrons of the Second Charge ; the Stipend of which is paid out ofthe Town's Patrimony, and is 1300 merks, together with the Teind of Fish brought into the harbour for sale, and for which the Fishermen Avere Avont to pay \u00a32. Sterling, but of late years they have paid nothing. It is in the Presbytery of St. Andrew's, and Synod of Fife. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (including the City and Royalty, part of the Suburbs of Argyle, and the Land-ward District) was 4203, aud, in 1811, Avas 4311. It is 39 m. N. b. E. from Edinburgh. The Market is aa* ell supplied. The Fairs are holden on the second Thursday, O. S., in April, 22d., O. S., of May, the first Tuesday, O. S., in July, the 1st., O. S., of August, and the 30th., O. S., of November. This City was formerly the Seat of the Primate of Scotland, and also of the Prior of St. Andrew's, whose Revenue greatly exceeded that of any other Churchman in Scotland : these tAvo Benefices were conjoined in the year 1635. The original name of this City was Mucross, i. e. Tlte Land qf Boars, the adjacent territory being then a Forest: But St. Regulus or St. Rule, a Monk of Patrce, in Achaia, being Avarned, as is said, by a vision to sail Westward, he landed in this neighbour hood, with some relics of the Apostle St. Andrew, about the year 370 : having been successful in converting the Picts, Hergustus, the King, changed the name of Mucross into that of Killrymont, i. e. Cella regis in monte, because the King had given to Regulus and his companions a piece of high ground, adjoining to the harbour, on which he also erected a Chapel and Tower in honour of the Monk, and bearingTiis name : the walls of St. Rule's Chapel, and the square"], [119, "AND Tower, still remain. The exemplary virtue of Regulus and his company causing a great resort of people to his chapel, the name of the City was soon changed from Killrymont to Kill-Rule, i.e. Cella Reguli, which name is still retained among the Scotch Highlanders. This Church was Supreme in the Kingdom of the Picts ; Ungus having* granted to God and St. AndreAV, that it should be the Head and Mother of all the Churches in his dominions : he also directed, that the Cross of St. Andrew should become the badge ofthe Country. In 518, after the Conquest ofthe Picts by the Scots, the name of Kill-Rule was changed into that of St. Andrew's, and the Metropolitan Church which, under the Picts, had been at Abernethy, was translated to St. Andrew's ; and, in 1441, it was erected into an Archbishopric by Sextus the Fourth, at the intercession of James the Third. The City of St. Andrew's is about a mile in circuit, and is pleasantly situate on a Bay ofthe German Ocean. It was erected into a Royal Borough by David the First in the year 1140, and the confirmation of their Privileges, by a Charter from Malcolm the Second, is still preser \\*ed in the Tolbooth ; Avhere also are kept the silver keys of the City. It is one of the Contributary Royal Boroughs Avith Perth, in sending one Member to Parliament. The government ofthe City is vested in a Provost, Dean of Guild, and four Baillies, who, with the Town-Treasurer, are called the Office-Bearers in the Council, and are annually elected at Michaelmas by the Avhole Council. The Dean of Guild here has the precedence ofthe Baillies, and is Preses of the Council, in the absence ofthe ProA'ost. No one is eligible into the Council, who is not a Burgess and Guild-Brother, and assessed in a portion of the public burdens within the City. The Provost is the only Member of the Council who is not obliged to reside : and he has also this further Privilege, that he may be re-elected every year as lona: as he lives, while none ofthe other Office-Bearers can continue above three years in immediate succession. A General Post-Office is established here. The Harbour is shallow, though safe and commodious, but not easily entered when the wind is Easterly. It had once an extensive Foreign trade ; but, after the Reformation, the City gradually fell into decay, from which it is noAv emerging, by the spirited exertions of a few individuals. Its principal exports are grain : and its chief manufactures are Sail-cloth, and Osnaburghs. The Courts of Law here are the Baillie Court, the Dean of Guild Court, the Justice of Peace Court, and the Commissary Court for the Diocese of St. Andrew's, whose regular place of Meeting is the Church of St. Salvator' s College. The Grammar School, -which is ably conducted by Mr. Mouat, is in the Patronage of the Towh II 2"], [120, "AND Council : the Rector enjoying, rent free, a spacious house and garden, and a Salary of \u00a316.. 3.. 4. Sterling, together with School-fees, and perquisites. There is also a School for English, writing, and arithmetic, with a Salary of 200 merks. paid by the Exchequer, and which is likewise in the Patronage of the Town- Council ; an elegant School-house was built in 1811. Proprietors in this Parish haA*e a particular adA'antage, that they are not burdened Avith a Minister's manse, nor School-master's Salary ; and hitherto they have been taxed with no more than one-third ofthe expense ofthe Parish Church, The King, as succeeding to the Archbishop, and The Corporation of the City, defraying the other two-thirds. In 1337, it sustained a siege, while in possession of the English and other par tisans of Baliol ; but the Loyalists, under the Earls of March and Fife, made themselves masters of it in three weeks. The ruins of the ancient Religious establishments still shoAV a part of the former magnificence of this celebrated City : \u2014 The Cathedral of St. Andrew's was founded in 1161, by Bishop Arnold, but did not attain its full magnificence until 1318 : of this superb Pile nothing noAv remains, except part ofthe East and West ends, and of the South side; with such success and expedition did sacrilege effect its ruin, under John Knox, in June 1559 : \u2014 Near its East end is the singular Chapel of St. Regulus, Avith a Square Tower 108 feet high : \u2014 The Priory was founded by Alexander the First, in 1122 ; and the Monks, w ho were Canons Regular of St. Augustine, were brought from Scone, in 1140, by Robert, Bishop ofthis See : by an Act of Parliament, in the reign of James the First, the Prior had precedence of all Abbots and Priors, and, on the days of Festival, Avore a Mitre, and all Episcopal ornaments : nothing remains of it, except the walls of the Precinct, which sIioav its vast extent: \u2014 the other Religious Houses were, The Dominican Abbey, and the Convent of Observan tines ; and, according to some writers, a Carmelite Monastery. Immediately above the Harbour stood the Collegiate Church of Kirk-heugh, originally founded for a Provost, and ten Prebendaries, by Constan tine the Third, who, retiring from the world, became here a Culdee. On the East side ofthe City are the poor remains of the Castle, which was built by Bishop Trail, in 1401, upon a rock overlooking the sea. \u2014 The celebrated University of St. Andrew's is the oldest in Scotland, having been founded in 1411, by Bishop Wardlaw: it formerly consisted of three Colleges, viz. St. Salvator's, founded in 1458, by James Kennedy, Bishop of St. Andrew's ; \u2014 St. Leonards, founded in 1512 by Prior Hepburn: \u2014 and, St. Mary's, founded in 1552, by Archbishop John Hamilton. In each of these Colleges, theology, philosophy, literature, and"], [121, "AND other branches of science, were taught by able Professors. But, in 1579, the University was completely new modelled, under the direction of the celebrated George Buchanan, St. Mary's being appropriated to Divinity, and denominated Divinity or New College. In 1747, on a petition from the Masters of the two Colleges of St. Salvator, and St. Leonard, they were united by Act of Parliament, under the designation of The United College : and the buildings of St. Leon ard's have been sold, and converted into private Houses. The UniA'ersity is governed by a Chancellor (His Royal Highness The Duke of Cambridge, in 1812), an office originally designed to be perpetually vested in the Archbishops of St. Andrews ; but since the Reformation, he is elected by the two Principals, and the Professors of both the Colleges. The Rector is the next great officer, to whose care is committed the privileges, discipline, and statutes ofthe Univer sity. The Principals and Professors, in Session time, wear black gowns, like those used by the Clergy in Scotland : the Students in the United College wear gowns of red or scarlet frieze, without sleeves : the Students of Divinity have no distinguishing dress. The Students may be boarded in the Colleges, or in private houses, or in those ofthe Professors : the price at the Colleges is mode rate for the Session, which lasts 6-\u00a3 months : the diet is good, and a Master always presides at the table. A public table is kept for the Bursars on the Foundation. The air is pure, and salubrious ; the place for exercise, dry, and extensive : the exercises themselves are healthy and innocent ; and the Univer sity Library is well stored with books in all the Sciences, to which every Student has access, for a small yearly payment.\u2014\" At an hour somewhat late,\" says Dr. Johnson, \" we came to St. Andrew's, a City once Archiepiscopal ; where that University still subsists, in which Philosophy was formerly taught by Buchanan, whose name has as fair a claim to Immortality as can be conferred by modern Latinity, and perhaps a fairer than the instability of vernacular language admits. We found, that, by the interposition of some invisible friend, lodgings had been provided for us at the House of one of the Professors, whose easy civility quickly made us forget that we were strangers ; and, in the whole time of our stay, we were gratified by every mode of kindness, and entertained with all the elegance of lettered hospitality. In the morning we rose to peram bulate a City, which only history shows to have once flourished, and surveyed the ruins of ancient magnificence, of Avhich even the ruins cannot long be visible, unless some care be taken to preserve them ; and where is the pleasure of pre serving such mournful memorials? they have been till very lately so much"], [122, "AND neglected, that every man carried away the stones who fancied that he wanted them. \u2014 The University, Avithin a few years, consisted of three Colleges, but is now reduced to two ; the College of St. Leonard being lately dissolved by the sale of its buildings,' and the appropriation of its revenues to the Professors ofthe tAvo others. The Chapel ofthe alienated College is yet standing, a Fabrick not inelegant of external structure : but I Avas always, by some civil excuse, hin dered from entering it. The dissolution of St. Leonard's College Avas doubtless necessary; but of that necessity there is reason to complain. Itis surely not without just reproach, that a Nation, ofwhich the commerce is hourly extending, and the wealth increasing, denies any participation of its prosperity to its Lit erary Societies ; and, while its Merchants or its Nobles are raising Palaces, suffers its Universities to moulder into dust.\" \u2014 The Parish of St. Andrew's is about 10 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth. A considerable part of it is covered with heath; but along the coast, the soil is fertile, and well cultivated. Coals, and free-stone, of excellent quality, are in abundance. The Public roads, and bridges, are in good repair. See, Leonard's, St. \u2014 Stratyrum, the elegant Seat of James Cheape, Esq., lays a mile West from the Town ; and Smiddy- Green, a small neat House of David Glass, Esq., is finely situate 4 miles East on the Road to Crail, St. Andrew's has the honour to give the title of Duke to His Royal Highness Prince William Henry, Duke of Clarence. ANDREW'S, ST., in the Shire of Elgin: formerly a Mensal Church belong ing to the Bishop of Moray ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 4 chalders of bear, and 400 merks, with \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements : Patron, The CroAvn. It is in the Presbytery of Elgin, and Synod of Moray. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (including the ancient Parish of Llan Bride) was 799, and, in 1811, Avas 869. It is If m. E. from Elgin. The Parish of St. AndreAv's was anciently called, the Barony of Kill-ma- Lemnoc, to which the ancient Parish of Llan Bride was united, before the Reformation. This Parish is about 3 English miles from East to West, and about 4 miles from North to South, exclusive of an improvement in the Hill one mile distant, on the South, which is disjoined by an intervening skirt of the Parish of Elgin, to which it be longs ; this was originally the Moor, where the cattle were collected for drawing part of the Teinds of both Parishes, before they were converted into money, from Avhich circumstance it retains the name of Teind-Land; and, on account of its distance from Elgin, the Inhabitants have in geneial ranked themselves in this Parish. The general appearance of the country is a Plain, in which several Ioav"], [123, "AND hills arise, so arranged as to seem connected With each other, and all covered with corn, grass, or plantations. The Soil is for the most part sandy, yet fertile, where it is low and damp. The air is dry, and healthful. In the Teind-Land, there is a strong Chalybeate Spring, but at present of no celebrity, though it has been found efficacious in many cases. There are seven Heritors ; \u2014 The Earl of Fife has the whole of Avhat was the Parish of Llan Bride, and the ancient Barony of Kill-ma-Lemnoc ; \u2014 The Earl of Seafield holds Linkwood, and Linksfield, in the West ; \u2014 The Honourable George Duff has Barmickitty, in the middle of the Parish ; \u2014 John Brander, Esq., holds Pitgaveny, in the North; \u2014 William King, Esq., has Newmill, and the Lands in the Vicinity of Elgin ; \u2014 and John Innes, Esq., Writer to the Signet, has Dunkinty, towards the East ; and a small Farm was, many years ago, given by Gordon, of Cairnfield, for the support of the Episcopal Chapel in Elgin. The Scottish is the only language spoken here. Although the Inhabitants ofthe Teind-Land axe at liberty to choose any Church most convenient, they are, however, bound to a particular Mill in their own Parish of Elgin ; and besides that Mill, there are eight others with which this Parish is connected : and the inhabitants in general murmur greatly on account of thirlage, and services. ANDREW'S, ST., in the Island of Pomona, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shetland : formerly a Vicarage, with the ancient Parish of Deer-Ness united ; the Stipend ofwhich, in 1811, Avas 18 meils 5 settens of oat-meal, 14 meils of malt, 5 barrels of butter, 40 meils 12 merks of bear, \u00a345. in money, and \u00a35. for Communion elements : the manse is in good condition : the glebe consists of more than the legal extent, and is inclosed : Patron, Lord Dundas : The Church, which is dedicated to St. Andrew, is in a ruinous and dangerous state. It is in the Presbytery of Kirkwall, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population of the Parish of St. Andrew, in 1801, was 857, and, in 1811, was 780. This Parish is about six miles in length, and from one to three miles in breadth ; and is joined to the Peninsula of Deer- Ness by a narrow neck ofland, about a mile long. It is in general flat : and the soil is loam and moss, interspersed with stones, upon a deep cold clay and tilly bottom . hence it is naturally wet and boggy in many places : the hills in the neighbourhood are bleak, and covered Avith heath, Avhich afford shelter to great numbers of Moor-game, and such other birds as delight in this sort of soil. Agriculture is much neglected here, for the Fisheries. There were formerly several Gentlemens' seats in the United Parishes, but they are all now in ruins : one of them, which belonged to the Coventrys, of Newark,"], [124, "ANN was built by John Lord Kinclaven, Earl of Carrick : another at Sandside, the seat of the Buchanans, has, on a chimney-piece, this remarkable inscription, \" Who can dwell with everlasting burnings.\" A road was made many years ago to the Parishes of St. Andrew's and Deer-Ness, on which was erected a stone-bridge, consisting of two arches, over a dangerous rivulet ; and these small improvements, by facilitating the communication Avith Kirkwall, have had some influence on their condition. The Bay of Inganess, which belongs to this Parish, is an excellent Harbour. A locality of this Stipend has been made out, but is not yet settled : it was made upon the footing of the rental in 1800 : Lord Dundas, the present Tacksman, has of late claimed a right to deduct thc Excise duty of the malt. ANGUS, now The Shire of Forfar. This County, and the larger part of that of Kincardine, were, during the Roman period, possessed by the Venricones. They were also anciently a part of the Pictish Kingdom ; and, upon the extinction of that government by Kenneth the Second, about the year 518, he divided this District into two Shires, and bestoAved them on his tAvo brothers, Eneas or Angus, and Mearns ; and from these brothers, Angus and Mearns received their appellations. The Shire of Angus lies on the North bank of the river Tay, its extent being, from the Eastern coast to the Grampians, about 48 miles ; and from Mount Pettie, on the borders of Perthshire, to the mouth ofthe river North Esk, about 42 miles ; containing about 593,920 statute acres. It is a well cultivated district ; and, upon the whole, for trade, agriculture, and ornamented surface, it can vie Avith almost any County in the Kingdom. Its Resident Population, in 1801, was 99,127, and, in 1811, was 107,264. In 1437 it gave the title of Earl, noAv extinct, to the family of Umfraville.

The Houses are decent, and well built. Here is a bridge, of five arches, over the river Annan : and there are also two Ferry-boats employed for passage to and from the coast of Cumberland. The Port of Annan is an excellent natural Harbour, having water sufficient to permit vessels of 250 or 300 tons to approach within half a mile of the Town ; but vessels of 60 tons burden can come up as far as the Bridge. This Port is comprehended Avithin the District ofthe Custom house of Dumfries. Its commerce is principally confined to the coasting trade. The Burgh Roods are very extensive ; and a large Common of 1600 acres, which was open to all the Inhabitants for pasture, peats, and divots, has lately been inclosed. The Revenue of the Corporation, arising from tolls, fisheries, and feu-duties, is about \u00a3300. Sterling per annum. Peats, and coals, are both commonly used for fuel. The Climate is healthy.

About the year 1371, upon the demise of David the Second, it fell into the hands of Randolph Earl of Moray, then Regent: and, with his Sister Agnes, it went to the Dunbars, Earls of March. After their forfeiture, it came to the Doug lasses, who lost it by the same fate. It is now a dormant Marquisate, in the Ancient and Illustrious family of Johnstone. A new Village has just been erected upon the estate of Lieutenant General Dirom, which is in a flourishing condition. ANNANDALE, a Stewartry or District, in the Shire of Dumfries.

A General Post-Office is established here. It is well supplied with provisions. Anstruther Easter is one of the Contribu tary Boroughs with Crail, in sending one Member to Parliament. This Parish is said to be confined to the Burgh. There are no Teinds in this Parish ; and the only document in the Teind Record as to this Parish, is a gift or mortifica tion by King William, in 1698, to the Minister of Anstruther Easter, of 400 merks out of the Feu and Teind duties formerly payable to the Archbishop of St."], [127, "ANS Andrew's \" furth of lands in the Parish of Killrenney.\" This gift is recorded, and the Lords Commissioners of Teinds interposed their authority thereto, as directed by the gift by their act and decreet of the 7th of July 1708 ; it is \u00a322.. 4.. 5^ Sterling. In 1710, this ToAvn, which Avas formerly a Creek of the Custom-house of Kirkaldy, Avas made a Port, and a Custom-house established. In 1753, a ne\\v Quay was built here ; and to defray the expense, an Act of Parliament was procured, laying a tax of two-pence Scotch upon every pint of Ale breAved or sold in the Burgh. Ship-building has been carried on here for some years to a considerable extent. The Fairs are holden on the first Tuesday after the 11th of April, the 5th of July, and the 12th of November.

The Magistrates are 3 Baillies, a Treasurer, and any number of Counsellors, from six to eleven. It is separated from Anstruther Easter by a small rivulet, which here falls into the Firth of Forth ; and in which, according to tradition, there was formerly a considerable Salmon fishery, and whence the Arms ofthe Town, bearing three Salmons, are said to be derived. The Harbour does not admit Ships of burden ; but, a little to the Westward, is a Creek, called West- Haven, which might be made an excellent harbour at a small expense ; and which is singularly useful in the Fishing Season. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, the rent of a Dwelling-house and School paid by the Heritors, and 10 merks paid by the Session for teaching poor children. This Town suffered much both by sea and 12"], [128, "A N W land in the Civil Wars, in the reign of Charles the First : and afterwards, by two great inundations of the sea. The Parish of Anstruther Wester contains about 540 Scotch acres of arable land, and about 7 or 8 acres of Common, on which the Burgesses have the privileges of pasturage, and of casting turf. The climate is moist, but not unhealthy. Thomas Bruce, of Grangemnir, the Pro prietor of almost the whole Parish, has lately built a handsome House a mile from the Town. ANTERMONY, v. CAMPSIE ANTHONY, ST., v. CANONGATE. ANTONINUSS WALL. The barrier which the Romans erected, across the Isthmus between the Forth and the Clyde, to protect their conquests in the Southern parts of Scotland. It was constructed by Lollius Urbicus, the Lieu tenant ofthe Emperor Antoninus Pius, about the year 140, to connect the chain of Forts erected by Agricola. It consisted of a ditch from 12 to 15 feet wide, the wall being formed ofthe earth thrown up in making the ditch: in a few of the most exposed situations, it was built of stone. It afterwards received the. appellation of Grime's or Graham's Dike, from a Chieftain of that name, who is said to have first broken through it. This Avail, one of the most remarkable pieces of Roman antiquity existing in Britain, is now nearly demolished by the plough-share. General Roy, in his 35th plate, has given a plan showing the course ofthis Wall, together Avith plans of those Stations belonging to it, from a Survey taken in 1755.

This Parish contains about 8600 acres, nearly 2900 of which are arable. It is bounded by the river Fleet on the East ; and on the South, by the Sohvay Firth, where the shore is generally flat and rocky, and affords no harbours. Upon the Sea-coast, and near the mouth of the river, the soil is dry and fertile; but, towards the North, the surface is uneven, and covered with heath, and is principally appropriated to the pasturage of Sheep. Here is a considerable quantity of natural wood, and thriving plantations. The Climate is rainy, but very healthy. Cairn-Harrah, which is the most remarkable"], [129, "APP Hill, is situate partly in this Parish, and partly in that of Kirk-Mabreck, and is elevated about 1100 feet above the level ofthe sea. On the Western bank ofthe river Fleet is a Village, which belongs to this Parish ; but being built opposite to Gatehouse, and being connected with it by a Bridge, is considered as part of that Village. The Salary ofthe Parochial School (which is kept at the Church), is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites. The great road, from Carlisle to Port-Patrick, passes through the Parish ; and the other roads are judiciously directed, and in good repair. Peats are scarce : coals are imported from Cumberland, and the Shire of Ayr. The ancient Tower of Rusco, situate on the banks of the Fleet, is still inhabited. The Castle of Cardoness is built on an eminence, looking towards the Bay at the mouth of the river, and affords one* of the most beautiful prospects that can well be imagined. On the summit of a hill, about half a mile South-East from the Church, is an ancient vilrifiedFoxt. There is some marl in the Parish, and the shells on the sea-shore seem to be inexhaustible. Lime is imported. APPIN, v. DULL.

It is watered by the rivers Creran, Duror, Bailichelish, Laroch, and Leven; besides several fresh water Lakes, and those extensive arms ofthe sea, called Loch Linnhe, Loch Creran, Loch Eil, and Loch Leven; all ofwhich abound with fish. At Ballahulish, near the head of Loch Leven, is a Quarry of fine blue slate, ofwhich great quantities are annually exported. Lime-stone is also in plenty. Near Appin House, the property of The Marquis of Tweeddale, are several enormous blocks of quartz, Avhich have been detached from the adjacent Mountains ; it is surrounded with noble woods. Castle Stalkir, a ruin of great beauty, stands upon a small Island in Loch Linnhe, and is the property of Mr. Campbell, of Airds,. Upon Island Mund (the old name of the Parish, and by which it is still designed in the Teind records at Edinburgh), a small Island in Loch Leven, are the ruins of a Chapel dedicated to St. Mungo,"], [130, "APP and which has long been the common Cemetery ofthe inhabitants of Glencoe. Airds, the Seat of Mr. Campbell, of Airds, is pleasantly situate on Loch Creran, amidst extensive plantations.

The Parish is divided into three Districts, each separated from the other by a ridge of hills, inaccessible in stormy weather : in the District of Lochs and Tirdon, the Minister officiates once a quarter ; and in that of Kishorn, once a month. The Gaelic is the only language ordinarily preached in the Parish. It is in the Pres bytery of Loch Carron, and Synod of Glenelg. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1896, and, in 1811, was 2297. It is 14 m. W. from Loch Carron. This is an extensive Parish, stretching along the Atlantic Ocean. The surface is mountainous, and rocky : but the vallies, betAveen the hills, are tolerably fertile ; and are principally appropriated to the pasturage of cattle. Game, of all kinds, are abundant ; and the sea affords a variety of excellent fish. Apple cross is a fanciful designation, assumed by one of the Proprietors of that part of the Parish, from which it derives its name : in commemoration of this circumstance, five Apple trees were planted in the form ofa Cross, and have since been perpetuated in that shape by his successors. But the ancient and only name, by which it is knoAvn in the language of the country, is Comrich, a Gaelic word, signifying Protection ; a name implying the immunity of the place in ancient times, this having been the seat of a Cloister, and, as such, an Asylum for all, who, either from persecution or merited punishment, fled for protection : close by the Church, are the remains of this Religious House, which was richly endoAved with landed property, and which tradition relates to have been conveyed, by the last Popish Missionary, in the place known by the designation of The Red Priest of Applecross, to his daughter. In the district"], [131, "APP of Kishorn, is a rich Copper mine ; and on the South side ofthe Bay of Apple cross, is a Lime-stone Quarry of excellent quality. In the centre of one of its most populous districts, are a feAV farms which constitute a part ofthe Parish of Loch Carron. The climate is very variable. There are three Proprietors ; the principal one is constantly resident, and pays four-fifths of the Stipend ; the estate has remained in the family for more than two centuries ; nor has there been an acre sold in the Parish for some generations. All the inhabitants are, in some degree, farmers and fishers, and distinct occupations are not common : every man is the architect of his own house ; and though there are a feAV nominal shoemakers, scarcely a youth of fifteen but makes his own brogues. There are several boat-wrights, and weavers ; the former being generally main tained by their employers, and paid by the piece ; the latter make their demand in money, but are paid in meal, at the conversion of half a merk Scotch the peck. There are three Smiths (when no private stipulation takes place) for agricultural purposes, who are paid in meal, by an immemorial assessment on the different farms : anciently they had the head of every cow that was slaugh tered in the Parish, a privilege which they still claim, but it is rarely complied with. The Salary of the Parochial School, which is fixed at Applecross, is 300 merks, together with School-fees, \" and the Cock-fight dues, which are equal to one Quarter's payment for each Scholar.\" Upon the coast, are several natural caves, and the ruins ofa Danish Dun or Fort. Various super stitious opinions still prevail here.

This Parish is situate in that part of the Shire of Dumfries, which was formerly called the Stewartry of Annandale : it is about 6 miles in length, and about 5 miles in breadth : the land is in general good, especially upon the banks of the Annan, and the Dryfe; and a spirit for the improvements in agriculture much prevails here. The great Turn-pike road, from Carlisle to Glasgow, and Edinburgh, passes through the Parish, for about 6 miles."], [132, "A R B Sir William Jardine, Bart., is the most considerable Heritor, and is commonly resident at Jardine Hall. There are t.vo School-houses lately built at the expense of the Heritors, who have voluntarily assessed themselves Avith the payment of \u00a35. Sterling annually to one of the Masters, and \u00a33.. 6.. 8. to the other. The Poor's list contains about 10 or 12 persons, Avho occasionally receive a small supply from the collections made in the Church; and, there is a morti fication of \u00a33..6..8. granted by the family of Applegarth, which, by the deed of mortification, is to be distributed at the sight, and by the advice of the Kirk- Session, amongst the Poor in the Barony of Applegarth, and nine merk-land of Sibbaldbie ; which is that part of the old Parisii of Sibbaldbie, that belongs to the estate of Applegarth. The common fuel is peats, which are procured by great labour, especially in wet seasons. The climate is healthy. See, Dinwoodie, and Sibbaldbie. AR\u00c6 FINIUM IMPERII ROM ANI, the Promontory which separates the Firths of Cromarty, and Moray : the former being the Loxa, and the latter the Varar, of Richard of Cirencester. General Roy, according to Mr. Chal mers, has mistakingly placed the Arce Finium on the more Northern point of Tarbet-Ness. ARASAIG, a District, in the Shire of Inverness ; and in the Parish of Ardnamurchan. It is 166 m. NW. b. W. from Edinburgh. It is situate on the Northern shore of Loch-na- Gaul ; to which place an excellent road has been made from Fort William, under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commis sioners ; andAvhich, besides affording a considerable share of local accommoda tion, is greatly beneficial as a road of general communication, as it is unques tionably the shortest possible road from Edinburgh, Glasgow, and the Southern parts ofthe Kingdom at large, to The Isles of Skye, North and South Uists, Barra, Canna, Rum, Eigg, Muck, &c. And as Loch-na- Gaul is in the imme diate vicinity of some of the best frequented Fishing Stations, the establishment of this road promotes, to a considerable degree, the interest of the Fisheries. The Post-master General, satisfied of the Utility of this Station at Loch-na- Gaul to the Public, has established a Post-Office here ; and the Guardians of Macdonald, of Clanronald, the Proprietor, have built an excellent and commo dious Inn at a very considerable expense. There is a Ferry, with a convenient landing place, from hence to Ardavasar Bay in the Isle of Skye. See, Ardna murchan, and Rannoch. ARBIGLAND, v.

This Parish is about 4 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth. The extent ofthe sea-coast is about 3 miles, where the soil is sandy, and very early: contiguous to this, it is a light rich loam, on a gravelly bottom, which becomes fertile in proportion to the season, and the care bestowed on its cul tivation. The climate is healthy. In the lower part of the Parish, coal is the common fuel ; but in the higher part, peats and turf are generally used. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. The little river Elliot flows through the Parish, in the bottom of a deep glen, and is not only an object of great beauty, but of utility, from the number of mills erected upon it. The Honourable Wil liam Maule is Proprietor of the Avhole Parish. The Parochial Schoolmaster has no legal Salary paid to him by the Heritor : his income consists of 8 bolls of meal, which was mortified in the year 1628, by Alexander Irvine, of Drum; and 5 bolls 8 pecks of oats, collected from the several tenants in the Parish, at the rate of two pecks for each plough ; and \u00a319..7..0.

It is in the Presbytery of Nairn, and Synod of Moray. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1256, and, in 1811, was 1275. It is 12 m. S. b. W. from Forres. This Parish is about 10 miles in length, and 7 miles in breadth, being divided by the river Findhorn, which is rapid, and frequently impassable every where, except at the Bridge of Dulsie, on the Highland road leading from Fort George to Edinburgh: there are two Boats on this river within the Parish, and K2"], [136, "A R D one on the Post-road ; but either from the mismanagement of the boatmen, or temerity of the people, many lives are lost. It is a hilly, mountainous district, mostly covered Avith heath, and, in some places, Avith Avood. The soil is very poor, and agriculture is little understood here ; but it is supposed, that there are about 2000 acres of arable land, and 4000 acres consisting of moss and moor, some part of Avhich seems to be capable of cultivation. The Climate is healthy. The Salary of the Established Schoolmaster is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites. There is also a Society School, in a distant part of thc Parish, for writing, and reading; and another, called a Spinning School, to which Mrs. Brodie, of Lethen, pays about one half of the Salary, the remainder being paidbv The Society, and the AA*hole is about \u00a310. Sterling : Mrs. Brodie like- Avise very generously gives fuel to the persons gratis, Avho have charge of this School. This Parish abounds Avith peat-moss, and moss-sir. There is an Inn at Dulsie Bridge; and, for four miles above it, the Strath is very narrow, being inclosed Avith high hills, and mountains, called The Streins. Game, of various kinds, are in plenty. The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, in their Fifth Report of April 181 1 , obsene, ' ' before We proceed to any of the roads North of the Great Valley of Scotland, it will be convenient to speak of a road Avhich has grown into some importance since the year 1809, and is not far from the Eastern termination of the Moy road. In June 1809, an application was made by Major James Cuninghame for assistance towards making a road from Relugas along the East side ofthe river Findhorn, to a junction with a Military road near Dulsie Bridge, thus connecting Forres with the Aviemore road and the South of Scotland ; the present road West ofthe Findhorn being a bad line, and in bad repair. Subsequently Sir James Grant, of Grant, proposed a branch which falls into this road at Tominarroch, pointing directly at Ardclach and Nairn, and this we have consented to consider as [part of the Findhorn Road. For the sake of expedition, the contributors have been permitted to undertake the contract, and some progress is already made.\" Its extent is 12\u00a3 miles. This line of road is completely within the Highland District, taking its commencement from the Military near Dulsie, and ending three miles on the Highland side ofthe Spring, called '* Outlaw Well,\" beyond which Spring, it is said, Civil Jurisdiction did not extend until the year 1745. In the month of June 1810, Major Cuninghame made a further application to The Commissioners for a bridge auxiliary to this road, and in his Memorial he states, \" that there is a Highroad from the Seaport of Nairn to the Church of Ardclach, which is distant"], [137, "A R D from the former about 8 miles : \u2014 That the Church of Ardclach stands on the North-West bank of the river Findhorn, immediately opposite, and within five or six hundred yards of the point where the Grantown branch is to join the Findhorn road: \u2014 That the Tenants and others on the South-East side of the river, with a view of gaining access to Church and Market, have cast over the river, at their own expense, abridge for foot passengers, not being able to com mand funds sufficient to erect one for wheel carriages : \u2014 That, if one for wheel carriages was erected, it would not only be a great accommodation to them, but would tend greatly to improvement, by opening a facility of procuring lime and other advantages, which are at present the great desiderata in that quarter ; and it would also open to the whole country, as far as GrantoAvn, and even beyond that place, a nearer communication Avith a Sea-port by three or four miles than any they now possess; and, by the same rule, would give to Nairn a more direct line of road to Grantown, and from thence to the East coast : \u2014 That there is abundance of wood upon the banks ofthe river at this spot, and a rocky foun dation on both sides, consequently, as the span ofthe river may be about 70 feet, he is led to believe that the cost ofa wooden bridge, and even ofa stone one, would not be very material.\" It is intended to proceed with it, so soon as the necessary preliminaries shall have been settled.

The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (including the Garrison of Fort George, and part of the Village of Campbell-Town) was 1041, and, in 1811, was 1287. It is lfm. E. from Fort George. This Parish is about 2f miles in length, and the same extent in breadth,"], [138, "A R D and contains 1985 acres, exclusive of the King's Farm. The greatest part of the old cultiAated land lies high, but much of what is not under culture, is Ioav: the soil is various, but generally fertile, except on the shore ofthe Moray Firth, where it is very sandy and flat. The air is extremely sharp, and, in winter, very piercing. The Gaelic, and English, languages are spoken here equally well. The peat-moss is three miles distant, and is almost exhausted : coals are im- ported from Sunderland, and Newcastle. The roads are exceedingly good. There are eight boats employed in the Fishery here. The vicinity of Fort George affords a ready market for the produce of the Farms. Where this Parish is divided from that of Nairn, tliere is a stone about 6 feet high, and 3 feet broad, called Tlie Cabbac Stone; and which, tradition says, was erected over a Chief- tain who fell in an affray about a Cheese, in the ToAvn of Inverness. The whole Parish is the property of Lord Cawdor, and was a part of the lands of the Bishop of Ross, with some Temple lands formerly belonging to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. The territory Avhich constitutes the Precinct of the Fort, was purchased by Government about the year 1746. Near to Ardersier, which is situate on the Southern shore ofthe Varar, 24 miles W. S.

This is a Head-land well known to Mariners, which gives name to a large Peninsula, and thence to the Parish : it signifies, in the Gaelic language, The Point of the Great Seas, appositely to its prominent situation amid the larger Hebrides, which, with the Peninsula, apparently divide the Ocean into several seas. From a Record in the Teind Office it appears, that, in the year 1630, this Peninsula was a separate Parish, called Kill-Choan, after the Church of that name dedicated to St. Coan : and the remaining districts of the present Parish of Ardnamurchan formed a second Parish, under the name of Island Finan, a beautiful little Island in Loch Sheil, then the Residence of the Minister, and Site ofthe principal Church, dedicated to St. Finan: but, in more ancient times, probably, the two most Northern districts were a third Parish, named Kill-Maria, after the Church, the walls of which remain at Keppoch in Arasaig, dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The Ru, i. e. The extremity of this Peninsula, and the South-West corner of the Parish, is remarkable as the most Western point ofthe Mainland of Great Britain, and the most noted Head-land, from Cape Wrath to the Mull of Cantyre, between which it is centrally situate. Within the extensive limits ofthis Parish are comprehended five several Districts, or Countries, as they are here called, \u2014 First, Ardnamurchan Proper, or The Parish of Kill-Choan, which is 16 miles in length, and 4f miles in its mean breadth: \u2014 Secondly, Sunart, which is 12 miles by 6; \u2014 Thirdly, Moidart, Avhich is 18 miles by 7; \u2014 Fourthly, Arasaig, which is 16 miles by 6; \u2014 and, Fifthly, South Mor'ar, which is 14 miles by 4: \u2014 the two first are in the Shire of Argyle, and, joining at Tarbert, a narroAV pass of two miles from Saline, a creek of Loch Sunart, to the West end of Loch Sheil, extend, in one range, from East to West ; the others are in the Shire of Inverness, and lie parallel to each other and to Sunart, from which Moidart is separated by the above Lake ; the river Sh eil being the Boundary between the North-East corner of Ardnamurchan, and South-West of Moidart, for about three miles, to its fall"], [140, "ARN ARICA, v.

The harbour is safe, and has good anchorage. Here the Duke of Argyle has a resident Chamberlain, who manages the busi ness of his estates in the whole isle of Mull, and Morvern. There are the ruins of a pretty large Castle, which is said to have been, for some time, the residence of Macdonald, Lord of The Isles. ARRADOUL, v. RATHVEN. ARRAN, ISLE, in the Firth of Clyde, and Shire of Bute. It is about 24 miles in length, and from eight to ten miles in breadth : and it is probable, that it was of considerable importance in very ancient times. There are many tra- ditions of Fingal, Avho is supposed to have enjoyed here the pleasures of the chase ; and many places still retain his name. It was ceded by Donald Bain to {\u00c6agnus the Norivegian invader; but recovered from Acho his successor, about the year 1264. It then became the property of the Crown. Hither Robert Bruce retired during his distresses, folloAved by his faithful vassals. About the year 1334, it formed part of the estate of Robert Stewart, great Steward of Scotland, aftenvards Robert the Second. James the Third, Avhen he married his Sister to Thomas Lord Boyd, created him Earl of Arran, and gave the Island for a portion. On his disgrace, it was bestowed on Sir James Hamilton; and in the Dukes of that Illustrious Family it still remains, Avith a very feAV farms excepted. This Isle contains the tAvo Parishes of Kill-Bride, and Kill-Mory, of each of which a separate description is given. The climate is very severe ; for, besides the violence of winds, the cold is very rigorous : but in summer, the air is remarkably salubrious, and invalids formerly resorted hither on that account, and to drink the whey of goat's milk. It constitutes part of the Shire of Bute, L2"], [142, "ARR and is subject to the same sort of Government : besides which, Justice is admin istered at the Barons Baillie-Court, avIio has power to fine as high as twenty Shillings, \u2014 can decide in matters of property, not exceeding forty shillings, \u2014 can imprison for a month; \u2014 and put delinquents into the stocks for three hours, but that only during the day. There are various remarkable Cairns, and Druidical circles. By a Memorial presented to The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, on the 20th of June 1805, by Alexander Marquis of Douglas and Clydesdale, Commissioner for His Grace Archibald Duke of Hamilton and Brandon, it appears, \" That the Island of Arran, which is the most considerable portion of the Comity of Bute, in Scotland, lies in the mouth of the Firth of Clyde, and abounds Avith Bays and Harbours, containing a numerous population of persons speaking the Gaelic or Erse language. In this Island considerable quantities of corn and cattle are raised, and it contains Quarries of lime-stone and other minerals; but, from the want of proper roads, bridges, and quays, the exportation of the produce of the Island is greatly obstructed ; and the importa tion of coals and other commodities from the Main-land of Scotland is attended Avith much greater danger, and more labour and hardship than would occur, if the natural advantages of the Island Avere improved. There is also a great and necessary resort of shipping to the Island, vessels being frequently compelled, by stress of weather, to take refuge in Broadwick and Lamblash Bays, opposite to the coast of Scotland ; and, at Black-Water- Foot, and other Harbours on that side of the Island, Avhich is near to the Mull of Cantyre and the North of Ireland ; but, from the Avant of inland communication in the Island, and there being no safe landing places, many heavy losses are sustained, both of lives and property. The Duke of Hamilton, being the chief Proprietor ofthe Island of Arran, is de sirous to ameliorate the condition ofthe people by promoting the general improve ment which the Act of Parliament was intended to encourage ; for which purpose the Petitioner makes the present application ; and hereAvith produces a Sketch ofthe Island, upon which are delineated the principal Bays and Harbours, and the most essential lines of Road : \u2014 No. I. Of these roads leading from the lime Quarries of Corry to Broadwick Bay and Lamblash, is 9| miles in length, and is one ofthe most necessary roads that can be made, for every purpose of improvement to the Island itself, and advantage to the opposite coast of Scotland.

This Parish is about 14 miles in length, exclusive of four Farms which lie on the East side of Loch Lomond, near the North end ofthe Lake; and is about 3 miles in breadth, on the average. The surface, which is very mountainous, was formerly covered with heath and bent; but it is noAv beginning to assume a better appearance, from the introduction of sheep. The climate is temperate, being sheltered from the bleak Avinds by the Mountains ; but it is subject to frequent and heavy falls of rain, accompanied with high winds. On the banks of Loch Lomond, is a considerable extent of oak wood. Personal Services are abolished. Loch Long is stored Avith various kinds offish, but no persons here, except a few individuals, give themselves the trouble of taking them. Peats are abundant; but from the uncertainty of the weather, coals are considered the cheaper fuel. The principal Roads, and Bridges, are kept in repair by Government : the line of Road, Avhich leads to Inverary, being the most public, is kept in good order ; but the line from Tarbet, leading to Tyn drum, is much neglected. A General Post-Office is established here ; and eA'ery night about Eight o'Clock (Wednesday excepted), a Post arrives from Inverary, and another, at the same hour, from Dumbarton : these are succeeded by other two, who wait their arrival, and Avho set out soon aster Avith the mails : thev meet near the head of Loch Long, where they are all stationed (that being half way between the Post-ToAvns, or 22 miles distant from each), and succeed each other alternately : there being no allowance made for horses, they are obliged to travel on foot, Avhich is a laborious task inAvinter : it, hoAvever, very rarely happens, that the snow is so deep on the Road, as to interrupt the free communication."], [144, "ASH Both the Gaelic and English languages are spoken here ; but the former is most prevalent, and is best understood, particularly by the old people. This Parish was originally an appendage ofthe Parish of Luss, from which it Avas disjoined in the year 1658. The situation of Arroquhar is very romantic, commanding a fine vieAv of Loch Lomond, and enveloped in Avoods, and surrounded by lofty mountains.

This is a high Hill in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, which rises in a conical form, with a rugged and very steep ascent, to the height of 796 feet above the level ofthe sea. On the South side, it is in many places a perpendi cular rock, exhibiting a range of basaltic columns, ofa pentagonal or hexagonal form, from 50 to 60 feet in length, and of 5 feet diameter. It affords an inex haustible supply of granite for paving the Streets, and of which considerable quantities are exported to London. From the pinnacle of Arthur's Seat, the vieAv is remarkably grand and extensive : and the Hill itself is a most majestic, as Avell as picturesque object, from Avhatever point it is surveyed.

The M2"], [148, "A U C surface is mountainous ; the summit of Tlte Buck, which is a Boundary ofthis Parish, being elevated 2377 feet above the level of the sea. The soil is mostly thin, dry, and early ; but it is principally appropriated to pasture. Game, of various kinds, are in abundance ; and the river Bogie, by which it is Avatered, contains plenty of trout. Free-stone, and lime-stone, are abundant. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 7 bolls 3 firlots and 2 pecks of meal, at 9 stone per boll, together with a house, and garden.

AUCHINLECK, in the District of Kyle, and Shire of Ayr : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 2 chalders of meal, 1 chalder of bear, common heap measure or 15 pecks to the bushel, and \u00a350..3..11f Sterling in money : the manse was built in 1756, in a particularly neat and commodious manner: the glebe consists of 6 acres : Patron, Bos well, of Auchinleck: The Church is in good condition. It is in the Presbytery of Ayr, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1214, and, in 1811, was 1382. It is If m. N. W. from Old Cumnock. This Parish is about 18 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth. It is a bleak, naked country : and the district of Glenmore, extending 8 miles in length, is entirely covered with heath. The soil is a shallow, poor clay, except on the banks ofthe Lugar and Ayr, where it is tolerably productive. The climate is wet. Coals, lime stone, and free-stone, are abundant: and, on the lands of Wallace-Town, is a Quarry of black fire-proof stone, Avhich is much used for fire-places and ovens. The public roads are in good repair. On the last Tuesday in August, here is a well frequented Fair, for the sale of Lambs. On the banks of the Lugar, are the remains ofthe old Castle, the ancient Seat of the family of the Boswell's, of Auchinleck : and near it, is The Place of Auchinleck, in a romantick and pleasant situation. Ayr's Moss, which extends 5 miles in length, and one in breadth, is remarkable for the defeat ofa party of the Covenanters, in the reign of Charles the Second. \u2014 \" From Glasgow,\" says Dr. Johnson, \" we directed our course to Auchinleck, an estate devolved, through a long series of ancestors, to Mr. father, the present possessor. Auchinleck, which signifies a stony field, seems not now to have any particular claim to its denomination. It is a district generally level, and sufficiently fertile, but, like all the Western side of Scotland, incommoded by very frequent rain. It was, with the rest of the country, generally naked, till the present possessor finding, by the growth of"], [149, "A U C some stately trees near his old Castle, that the ground was favourable enough to timber, adorned it very diligently with annual plantations. Lord Auchinleck, avIio is one of the Judges of Scotland, and therefore not wholly at leisure for domestic business or pleasure, has yet found time to make improvements in his patrimony. He has built a house of hewn stone, very stately and durable, and has advanced the value of his lands with great tenderness to his Tenants. I was, however, less delighted with the elegance of the modern mansion, than with the sullen dignity of the old Castle. I clambered with Mr. Bosavell among the ruins, which afford striking images of ancient life. It is, like other Castles, built upon a point of rock, and was, I believe, anciently surrounded with a moat. There is another rock near it, to which the Draw-bridge, when it Avas let down, is said to have reached. Here, in the ages of tumult and rapine, the Laird was surprised and killed by the neighbouring Chief, who perhaps might have extinguished the family, had he not in a few days been seized and hanged, together with his sons, by Douglas, who came with his forces to the relief of Auchinleck.\" \u2014 Mr. Grose has preserved a view ofthe old Castle.

AUCHMEDDEN, in the Shire of Banff : and in the Parish of Aberdour. It is 3-\u00a7- m. W. N. W. from Aberdour. This is a small Fishing Village, situate at the confluence ofthe Burns of Troup and Auchmedden, with the Moray Firth. Here was formerly a small and convenient Harbour, sheltered by a Pier ; but, being neglected, it is now totally destroyed, and the stones which formed the Pier being washed into the former bason, it is now with difficulty that fishing boats can enter, especially if there is any great agitation ofthe sea. Here is a small School, the master of which, besides the usual School-fees, has a yearly Salary of \u00a32..1..8. Sterling, which is paid out ofthe interest of money mortified for that purpose by one of the Lairds of Auchmedden, and his Lady's Sister, Lady Jean Hay, a daughter of The Earl of Kinnoul, and ofwhich the Church Session are Trustees. In the face of a tremendous precipice, overhanging the sea, is a mill-stone Quarry, of excellent quality, belonging to The Earl of Aber- deen. This was long the residence of the very ancient and respectable Family of Baird."], [150, "A U C AUCHMITHY, in the Shire of Forfar; and in the Parish of St.Vigean's. This is a Fishing Village upon the German Ocean, about 3| miles North-East from Aber-Brothock. It is situate on a high, rocky bank, which rises about 120 feet above the sea, and is irregularly built; but contains several good houses, upon feus granted by The Earl of Northesk. The Harbour is only a level beach, in an opening between the high rocks which surround this part of the coast; and, after every Voyage, the boats are obliged to be drawn up from the sea, to prevent their being destroyed by the violence of the waves. Near the village is The Gaylet Pot, a remarkable cavern, into which the sea flows. AUCHMONNACH, v. SORN. AUCHMULL, v. NEWHILLS. AUCHNACARIE, v. KILL-MALIE. AUCHNAFREY, v. MONZIE. AUCHREDDY, v.

AUCHTERARDER, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Vicarage, with the Parish of Aber-Ruthven united ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : the manse is in decent repair : the glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Patron, The Earl of Kinnoul : The Church was built in 1784. It is in the Pres bytery of Auchterarder, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Popu lation of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Villages of Auchterarder, Aber- Ruthven, Borland-Park, and Mill-Town) was 2042, and, in 1811, was '2508. It is 54-i- m. N. W. from Edinburgh. The Fairs are holden on the 10th of March, O. S., the second Tuesday, O. S. in July, the 2d of August, O. S., the 7th of October, and the 24th of November, O. S. A General Post-Office is estab lished here. The Village of Auchterarder formerly enjoyed the privileges of a Royal Borough, and many ofthe houses are still holden by Burgage tenure. The great inconvenience under which it labours, is the want of water. The principal manufacture is linen. Coals are the common fuel. This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and nearly of the same breadth, comprising part ofthe Ochil Hills : the higher lands afford good pasture for sheep : the lower lands, on the banks ofthe Earn, are a light dry soil, and abundantly fertile. The air is pure and healthy in summer, but in winter it is damp and cold. The Parish abounds with stone, fit for building: and there are also quarries of a particular kind of thin grey slate. Game is in plenty. The great Road, from Perth to"], [151, "A U C Glasgow, leads through the Village, which is kept in good repair, but the other roads are indifferent. Here are the remains of an old Castle, which is said to have been a Hunting-Seat of King Malcolm Canmore. A little to the North ward ofthis Castle, are the ruins ofa Chapel, commonly known by the name of the Old Kirk, or St. Mungo's Chapel: it was formerly the Parish Church : the Church-yard was the general Burying-ground, and many of the inhabitants still continue to use it. There are some vestiges of Roman encampments. The Vil lage of Auchterarder, together with several others in the neighbourhood, were burned by an order ofthe Pretender, dated from his Court at Scone, the 17th of January, 1716 : this cruel command was executed in a most uncommonly severe season ; and the poor inhabitants of every age and sex were left exposed to the rigour of the cold. To palliate these proceedings, the necessity of obstructing the march of the King's forces towards Perth, was pleaded : and that the Pre tender, on his flight from that City, left in the hands of General Gordon, for the use of the sufferers, a large sum of money, with a letter to The Duke of Argyle, requesting a proper distribution. AUCHTERDERRAN, in the District of Kirkaldy, and Shire of Fife : for merly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150.: the manse was built in 1784 : the glebe consists of more than the legal extent, and a garden : Patron, Lord Balmuto: The Church was built in 1789.

The Public roads are in tolerable repair. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with moderate School-fees. Coals are in great plenty, and exceedingly cheap : and there is likewise great abundance of lime-stone, and free-stone.

AUCHTERGAVEN, in the Shire of Perth: formerly a Vicarage, with the ancient Parish of Logie-Bride annexed: the Stipend of which, by interlocutor of modification, on the 24th of June 1795, was 41 bolls 3 firlots 2 pecks of oat-meal, and 10 bolls of bear, together with \u00a372. 19.. 8. Sterling in money, and \u00a35..0..0. for Communion elements: this process is still in dependence; two questions in it are not yet determined; 1st., whether certain lands are holden cum decimis inclusis; and, 2nd., whether 27 bolls of Teind, said to be granted to the Hospital"], [152, "A U C of Dunkeld are subject to allocation for Stipend; and by a decision ofthe Court. on the 4th of December 1811, it is probable that there will be a fund for augmen tation, but the amount is uncertain: the manse was built in 1745: the glebe con sists of 4f acres: Patron, The Crown: The Church is in bad repair. It is in the Presbytery of Dunkeld, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (including the Village of Stanley) was 2042, and, in 1811, was 2557. It is 8f m.

It is in the Presbytery of Dundee, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (containing the Villages of Dronlaw, and Kirk- Town) was 653, and, in 1811, was 635. It is 7 m. N.W. from Dundee. This Parish con tains about 4160 acres; of which, about 3160 are arable. It is pleasantly situate on the South side of the Sidlaw Hills; the soil is moorish, but great improvements in agriculture have been made here, since the discovery and application of marl: and inclosures are pretty general. The air is keen, but not unhealthy. This Parish abounds with good water, free-stone, and moss. The Turn-pike road from Dundee to Meigle runs through it. The Salary of the Parochial School is 400 merks Scotch, and a good School-house ; and it is in a flourishing condition. Upon the summit of one of the Sidlaw Hills, called Tlie Whitesheets, about a mile North from the Church, are evident traces of an"], [153, "A U C ancient fortification, comprising about two acres, and inclosed with deep ditches and stone walls. The House of Auchterhouse, a Seat of The Earl of Airly, has been uninhabited for some time, and is rather in a ruinous state. Adjoining to it, there stands a part of a very old building, which goes by the name of The Tower: the remaining walls are still ten feet in height, and about eight in thickness, and are cemented in the strongest manner : it is said to have been very lofty, and that the Parish derived its name from this circumstance. The Earl of Airly is proprietor ofthe Barony of Auchterhouse. AUCHTERLESS, in the District of Turrets, and Shire of Aberdeen: for merly a Rectory, belonging to the Chanter of Aberdeen ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 96 bolls of oat-meal, and \u00a348.. 6.. 8. in money : the manse was built in 1769: the glebe, and a small garden, measure 6 acres : Patron, The Crown: The Church was rebuilt in a handsome style, in 1780.

The soil is in some places a deep black mould ; but the greater part is light, and gravelly, inter mixed with clay, which is early, and productive of good crops. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites. The rents are paid partly in money and oat-meal, and a variety of customs and services, which, it is hoped, will soon be abolished. Fuel is expensive. Here is neither lime-stone, nor marl. There are some Druidical circles, which are still judiciously spared for their antiquity, although stones are so scarce. At an Inn, on the Post-road leading from Aberdeen to Banff, letters and newspapers are usually left by the Post, and returns forwarded in the same manner to the first Office. The strong and extensive Roman Camp near the farming village of Glen-Mailen, which the people of the country call The Rae-dykes, stands on the Southern bank of the /than, a mile below the two well known springs of the river. This Camp, according to Mr. Chalmers, was undoubtedly the Sta tion Ad Itunam of Richard of Cirencester, which, from its central situation, commanded the ample extent of the Shire of Aberdeen, the ancient country of the Taixali. There are other remains, in the vicinity ofthis Camp, which indi cate the long residence there of a military people. The Camp at Glen-Mailen, as well as the Camp at Urie, is called The .Roe-dykes, from the Gaelic word Rae, which signifies a cleared spot, a Fortress.

The small Burn of Tout or Teel takes its rise from the Lake Camilla, which abounds with perch. This Lake derives its name from the Castle of Camilla, situate on its Western bank, and which was called Camilla, from one ofthe family of Campbell, Countess of Moray. Its ancient name was Hall yards, when it belonged to the family of Skene. It is said to have been the ren dezvous ofthe Lairds of Fife, at the Rebellion in 1715. When James the Fifth of Scotland was on his road to the Palace of Falkland, after the defeat of his army on the English Border, under the command of Oliver Sinclair, his favourite, he lodged one night in the house of Hallyards, as he passed, where he was courteously received by the Lady of Grange, \" ane ancient and godlie ma trone,\" as Knox calls her : from whence it seems to have then belonged to the Kirkaldies, of Grange, a family of considerable note in the History of Scotland: it is now a ruin.

The ground rises gradually from the Coast to the inland part ofthe Parish, where it becomes hilly : the soil is various, and is fertile in proportion to its vicinity to the sea, There is a very extensive bed of marl upon Lord Cawdor's estate in Loch Lity ; which covers about 40 acres to the depth of from 16 to 20 feet, and might be drained at a small expense. The climate is healthy and serene, particularly in the lower and level parts of the Parish. Lethen is the elegant seat of Mrs. Brodie. And, in a delightful Plain, North of the Church, is the Family seat of the Dunbars, of Booth, the oldest branch of the Family of Durris, and who have been Proprietors of that estate upwards of 270 years.

The Plantations are numerous on the estates of all the Proprietors, but especially on those of Mr. Gordon, whose woods exceed 600 acres ; and whose unwearied exertions, in the improvement and embellishment of his estate, deserve the highest praise. The most considerable peat-moss belongs to Mr. Brodie, of Brodie.

It is now a Burgh of Barony, under the Superiority of Colonel Brodie. At Inshoch, which is situate on the South coast of the Var ar or Moray Firth, about 15 miles W. S. W. from Ptoroton, and 3 miles East from Nairn, several remains of Ro man arms, all of ancient Roman brass, were discovered in a moss ; which were presented to The Society of Antiquaries of Edinburgh, by The Reverend John Grant, in the month of January 1783.

The soil, and surface, are various ; and it is reckoned in general exceedingly fertile, though the arts of modern hus bandry are not much known. The fisheries are prosecuted with great success. There are several Quarries of excellent free-stone ; and, in the Bay of Munlochy, is one ofa hard reddish nature, accessible to boats at the water's edge, and from whence almost the whole of the extensive works at Fort George were erected. Rosehaugh House, the fine seat of Sir Roderick Mackenzie, Bart., of Scatwell, is surrounded with extensive plantations, and well cultivated grounds; and he is pro prietor of two-thirds ofthe Parish. A considerable quantity of coarse linen, and Osnaburghs, are manufactured here. The roads, and bridges, are in good repair."], [158, "AYR The Minister of Avoch is Co-administrator with the Minister of Rosemarkie, of the fund which pays the Salaries ofthe Masters in the Academy at Fortrose ; and also of some lands bequeathed by a late Countess of Seaforth, for the support ofthe Poor in the same Burgh.

AYR, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the District of Kyle, and Shire of Ayr : formerly a Rectory, served by two Ministers ; by decreet of The High Commission, 25th of February, 1648, recorded in the new Record of the Teind Office, on the 12th of June 1717, the Commission valued the whole Teinds, and settled a Stipend on the First Minister of 8 chal ders and 8 bolls of victual, and 8 bolls for Communion elements ; and it then proceeds thus; \" They ordain, that in all time coming there be two Ministers for serving the Cure at the said Kirk of Ayr, and the Collegue Minister to be placed by the Provost, Baillies, Council, and Kirk Session of Ayr, as Patrons ; and decern and ordain the said Provost, Baillies, and Council, to contract and pay to the said Collegue Minister of Ayr and his Successors, 1000 merks money (or \u00a355..11..1tV) out ofthe Miln and Friar Lands, and surplus of the Teinds, so far as the same will reach, or otherwise out of the common good of the said Burgh of Ayr.\" And the Commissioners for the Town of Ayr protested, \" That it be lawful for them to value any lands omitted out ofthe rental, and to re-value what is within the true worth, and the benefit of said valuation ofthe Teind to be allocate to the pursuer, the First Minister, to redound to him, for making up the 9 chalders victual of Stipend.\" The whole valuation by the rental on which it proceeded, was said to be only in stock and teind, 10 chalders 8 bolls 13 pecks of victual, and \u00a317. in money: but it appears, by summing up the parti culars of the rentals as valued, that the Teind amounts to 10 chalders 10 bolls and 3 firlots. So far then, as appears from this decreet, there is no fund of Teind . for an augmentation to the Stipend of the Second Minister, which, as stated above, is \u00a355..11..1TV ; but, by the Report of the Presbytery, there has been added the half of the Stipend of the annexed Parish of Alloa, amounting to \u00a316.. 13. .4., though this is not on record : if the Court shall be pleased to allow \u00a38..6..8, for Communion elements, there will then rest \u00a386..2,.2T'T. for Parlia-"], [159, "AYR mentary augmentation: the First Minister has a tolerably good glebe, and an allowance for a house : the Second Minister has also an allowance for a house : Patrons, The Crown, ofthe First Charge ; and The Town Council and Session, of the Second : The present Church was built in 1654, and is kept in good repair by the Magistrates. It is in the Presbytery of Ayr, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 5492, and, in 1811, was 6291. It is 76 m. S. W. from Edinburgh. The Market is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the first Tuesday, O. S., in January, the last Tuesday, O. S., in June, and the third Tuesday in October. A General Post-Office is established here. It is pleasantly situate on the Southern bank of the river Ayr, at its confluence with the Atlantic Ocean. It is a very gay and fashionable place, and its Races are well attended. The sea-shore is flat and shallow, and the entrance ofthe river Ayr, which forms the harbour, is subject to the inconvenience of a bar of sand, that does not admit of vessels drawing more than 12 feet water. The principal trade carried on here, is the exporta tion of coals to Ireland. It is the County Town ; and here the High Court of Justiciary, for the Southern Circuit, is holden: It is also the Seat ofthe Pres bytery. Ayr was erected into a Royal Borough by William the Lion, about the year 1 180 ; and the privileges granted by that charter, are still enjoyed by the Town. Il is one of the Contributary Royal Boroughs with Irvine, in sending one Member to Parliament. This Town was in ancient times not only distin guished for trade, but also for military strength : here Sir William Wallace began his heroic exploits, and here Edward the First fixed one of his most powerful garrisons. Oliver Cromwell judging it also a proper place to build a fortress, bought the old Church of St. John Baptist for 1000 English merks, and converted it, and the neighbouring ground, into a regular Citadel : there is evidence also of the Church of St. John having been the seat of a Parliament, holden in the time of Bruce and Baliol, and where a number of the Nobility and Gentry determined upon noble and free motives, to support Bruce's title to the throne : it was granted by Charles the Second to Lord Eglintoun. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. The Parish of Ayr is about 4 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth, lying between the rivers Doon and Ayr, and bounded on the West by the Atlantic Ocean. The soil is for the most part deep, and well cultivated, and much embellished by several elegant Seats and Plan tations. The climate is moist, but not unhealthy. The Fisheries in the rivers, and on the coast, are prosecuted with great success. Coal is the common fuel."], [160, "AYR Here Robert Burns, the celebrated Poet, was born on the 29th of January, 1759 : his works possess uncommon beautv, and an elegant simplicity, vvhich cannot be sufficiently admired : in 1796, he sunk into an untimely grave, and left behind him a widow and four children ; towards whom the hand of benevo- lence, guided by the kind interference of Dr. Currie, of Liverpool, who edited his Poems and Letters in 4 vols. 8vo. 1800, was humanely extended to raise them above the miseries of low and often vicious indigence, and the handsome sum of \u00a31000. was obtained as the profit of the Publication. The Monastery here, was founded by William Bishop of St. Andrew's, in the year 1230 ; or rather by King Alexander the Second : and was the first House which the Dominicans, or Black Friars, had in this Countiy*. The Monastery of the Ob servantines here, was founded in 1472, by the Inhabitants of this City : and Vandingus speaks ofa Statue ofthe Virgin Mary, which is said to have worked a great many miracles here.

This Shire extends 90 miles along the Western coast of Scotland, from its Southern boundary near Loch Ryan in the Shire of Wig- town, to Kelly Bridge, which separates it from the Shire of Renfrew on the North : its breadth is in general from 20 to 25 miles. It contains three Divi- sions, viz. , Carrick, on the South ; Coil or Kyle, in the Centre ; and Cuninghame, which includes all the Northern district. On the shore, the soil is generally light and sandy, interspered with deep and fertile loam. A great part of the County is of a strong productive clay. In many parts a bare till or schistus ex- tends for miles ; and over it only a few inches of a better clay soil. Further up the country, there is a kind of spongy clay land, cold, wet, and obdurate ; pro- ducing grass, unfit, in its present state, for fattening cattle, and merely sufficient to keep alive a breeding stock. On the Eastern boundaries of the County, the land is high and moorish, and is intersected with mosses, bogs, and marshes : But much praise is due to the Landholders and Farmers, for the very rapid pro- gress which they have made in agriculture. A great proportion of the landed estates have changed their owners in consequence of individual extravagance, expensive engagements, and the distresses occasioned by the failure of the Ayr Bank in the year 1772. The Resident Population of this Shire, in 1801, was 84,306, and, in 1811, was 103,954. It sends one Member to Parliament. AYR'S MOSS, v.

It is in the Presbytery of Chirnside, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 1453, and in 1811, was 1379. It is 47f m. E. b. S. from Edinburgh, and 1\\ m. N. b. W. from Berwick upon Tweed. Here is a General Post-Office. This Parish is about 4-|- miles in length, and 4 miles in breadth : it was once of larger extent, containing Lamberton, Ross, and Shiels. The Soil is in general fertile, and particularly adapted for the culture of turnips, ancl barley. The Southern part ofthe Parish is hilly ; but, even there, the soil is productive of corn, and grass : and of late, this Parish has been much improved in its husbandry, and the greatest part is now inclosed. The air is dry, and salubrious. As the Sea forms the Boundary on the East, it is in general well supplied with fish : it has about two miles extent of sea coast, which is high and rocky. Its vicinity to the Village of Eyemouth, and the Town of Berwick, affords a ready Market for the superabundant produce of the Farms. The Fair is holden on the 12th of October. The Roads are in good repair. About 15 or 20 tons of kelp are made here annually. There is one public, and two private Schools in the Parish; the Salary ofthe established Schoolmaster being 300 merks, and perquisites. It is at no great distance from coals, though the price, considering that distance, is certainly high. Upon the Hills, on the South side of the Parish, are the remains of two Camps, supposed to be Roman or Saxon: and where several urns, and broken pieces of armour, have been discovered. In the low grounds, towards the North-West, are the vestiges of three encampments, which are thought to have been made by the Danes or Picts. Being situate near Berwick Bounds, Ayton has been the scene of great events : a truce was made here, in 1384, within the Church. In the month of July, 1497, the small Castle 4>f Ayton, of which scarcely any vestiges now remain, was taken by the Earl of Surrey : and, on the 30th of September following, a seven years truce wa* signed between the hostile kingdoms, again within the Church of Ayton.

It is about 33 miles in length, and 27 miles in breadth, and is very mountainous, and barren. It is watered by the Spey, and a few rivulets : and there are also several Lochs, some of which are of considerable extent, and are well stocked with fish. There is a great extent of natural Forest, which abounds with game. It gave the title of Baron to the family of Cumyn, forfeited in 1306. Upon a moor, between the bridge of Spey, and Pitmain, there is the appearance of a Roman Camp; near which, a Roman tripod was found, concealed in a rock; and an urn full of burnt ashes was dug up, in clearing* some ground adjacent.

E. from Castle Town. The Resident Population ofthis Village, in 1792, was 360. It is pleasantly situate on the Eastern bank of a river, and has many Mills; but the Cotton-Works, belonging to Messrs. De la Prime, which were conducted on the same principles with those in Lancashire, are now aban doned. This is the residence ofthe Deemster, for the Southern Division ofthe Island. In each of the four Towns there is a High Bailiff, or Inferior Judge, who gives judgment for small debts, not exceeding 40*. of Manks currency. But all pecuniary litigations to a greater amount, and prosecutions for defamation personal injuries, and are generally brought before the Deemster at Bala-Salla; who either determines them according to his own judgment, or should they be important, deems them to be decided by a Jury at Common Law, where he sits as one ofthe Judges. Contiguous to the Village, are the ruins ofthe venerable Abbey of St. Mary of Rushen; founded in the year 1098, by one Mac Manis, a person whose wisdom and virtue raised him to the Diadem ofthe Isles. This Religious Establishment consisted of an Abbot and twelve Monks; who, at first, lived by their manual labour, and denied themselves the indulgence of"], [163, "B A L wearing shoes, furs, and linen; or of eating flesh, except on journies. In 1134, Olave, King of Man, gave to Evan, Abbot of Furness in Lancashire, the Mon astery of Rushen with additional lands, and a third part of the Tythes of his Kingdom. He either enlarged or re-built the Abbey, dedicated it to The Blessed Virgin, instituted the Cistertian discipline, and made it a Cell to the Abbey of Furness. In 1192, the Monks removed to Douglas, but in four years afterwards returned. The religious self-denial and austerity of the Monks now gave way to indolence, and the refinements of luxury. Their temporal Dignity was also increased. The Abbot became a Baron ofthe Island, was invested with power to hold Temporal Courts in his own name, and could exempt his own Tenant, although a Criminal, from the sentence of the Lord's Court, and try him by a Jury of his own vassals. The election ofthe Abbot was generally sanctioned by the approbation of the Abbot of Furness, to whom not only this Monastery, but perhaps even the Bishopric of the Island was in some degree subject. Many of the Kings of The Isles being interred here, it was not only liberally endowed, but richly decorated. In the year 1316, it was, however, plundered by Richard le Mandeville, who, with his followers, having remained a month here, returned to Ireland. At a short distance is an ancient Bridge, formed of two arches, over the Castle Town river: it is esteemed of great anti quity, but whether it belonged to the Abbey or not, is unknown. It is ex tremely narrow, the passage being only 6 feet 8 inches in the clear, exclusive of the parapet walls' now almost demolished: one of the arches is nearly semi circular, and the other somewhat pointed, but both are irregular. Mr. Grose has preserved a very correct view of it. In the reign of King James, the Abbey belonged to the Crown: but, in 1611, it was granted to Lord Derby and his heirs, to hold for ever under the Manor of East Greenwich, paying the accus tomed rents to the King as Lord ofthe same. All the Abbey Lands were holden under one grant, at the annual rentof\u00a3101..15..11., and of \u00a320.. 17.. 0. in lieu of woods, mines, and quarries. These are the sums originally fixed by Henrt tlie Eighth, when he took possession of this property, and let it to the Earl of Derby. The site ofthe Abbey, with the adjoining lands, is now the property of Mr. Moore, chief Deemster ofthe Island, whose father built an elegant mansion upon it, and converted many parts ofthe ancient Monastery into offices, which still retain an air of gloomy grandeur.

The climate is healthy. The Public Roads are in good repair. This Parish abounds in excellent coal, and limestone : but the only coal worked for fuel, is the property of Robert Dunmore, Esq., of Ballindalloch, whose exertions for the improve ment of his own estate, and ofthe country in general, cannot be mentioned with too much praise : this Gentleman works the limealso to a very considerable extent.

Balgonie Castle, one ofthe Seats of The Earl of Leven, is a building of great antiquity, and considerable strength; it gives the title of Viscount to the Ancient and Noble family of Leslie. This Castle anciently belonged to a family ofthe name of Sibbald, and was purchased in the reign of Charles the First by General Leslie, who, in 1641, was created Earl of Leven by that Monarch. Towards the end of the Seventeenth Century, David, second son of George Earl of Melville, married the Countess and Heiress of Leven, in consequence of which, the Estates and Titles of the two Earldoms came to be united in the same family, as Lord Raith, the eldest son ofthe said Earl of Melville, died without issue. Here is a private School under the immediate Patronage of The Countess of Leven, who, with a benevolence and patriotism corresponding with her high birth and accomplishments, has built, at her own expense, a School^house, and a house for the Master ; and by the encouragement which Her Ladyship has afforded, and the personal attention she has paid to it, has greatly contributed to its prosperity and success. Her Ladyship has also established here, a School for teaching young girls to sew ; and has provided a house for the Mistress, with an apartment for teaching, and has given such encouragement, as to induce a woman of good abilities and education to undertake the management of it. Several years ago, an extensive Smelting Manufactory of Iron Ore was established here by a Company from Newcastle ; being induced to fix on the situation, from the inexhaustible Seams of Coal, and Iron-stone, and the benefit of the river of Leven for driving the machinery.

This road is also particularly useful to the Farmers on the adjoining lands. It is the property of Neill Malcolm, Esq. From Ballenoch a road is carried to the boating-place at Keills, which forms the point of communication between the Main-land ofthe Shire of Argyle, and the Islands of Jura, and Islay.

The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 277, and, in 1811, was 269. It is 5 m. N. N. E. from Beath. This Parish is about 3 miles in length, and one mile in breadth, and is principally appro priated to pasturage. Coals, and limestone, both of an excellent quality, are in abundance. A plan was lately formed for draining Loch-Ore, which is now completed, and the land is under culture ; and independent of the benefit of obtaining about 150 acres of good land, the adjacent grounds are thereby drained, which were annually overflowed : towards its Eastern extremity, is a small Island, upon which is situate an old ruinous Castle, surrounded by a high wall. It was built by Duncan de Lochore, proprietor of the estate in the reign of Malcolm the Third ; but the estate passing into the hands ofthe Wardlaws, of Torry, it from them received considerable repairs, and the name of Robertus Wao'dlaw is engraven upon tlie chief entrance to the Tower : it was afterwards purchased by Captain Park, and is now the property of Mr. Jobson. A little to theWestward ofthe House of Loch-Ore, are the vestiges of a Roman camp, and in the neighbourhood various Roman antiquities have been discovered, particu larly adjoining to the walls ofthe Tower. BALLOCH, v. KILL-MARONOCK. BALLOCH, CASTLE, v. KENMORE BALLOCHROY, v. MULL, ISLE. BALLOGIE, v. BIRSE. BALLUMB1E, in the Shire of Forfar ; and in the Parish of Muirhouse. This Estate formerly belonged to a family of the name of Lovell, and being afterwards part ofthe entailed property of tlie late Earl of Panmure, was sold by Mr. Maule under the authority of the Act of Parliament for the redemption ofthe Land Tax. In this Castle the celebrated Catherine Douglas resided; whose arm was fractured, when attempting to stop the Assassins, who murdered James the First, King of Scotland, in the Town of Perth : this heroic Lady was married to Alexander Lovell, and lived in suitable splendour here. Tradi tion reports, that one of the family was a very turbulent member of Society; enjoying the security of the Castle, he amused himself in shooting arrows at the passengers, and in similar acts of aggression on the peaceable inhabitants ofthe neighbourhood: being in a state of hostility with his nearest neighbour, Graham of Duntrune, it is said, that Graham once before Easter sent a Servant to him with a goose as a peace-offering, and that Lovell compelled the servant to eat"], [171, "B A L the whole of it in his presence, and returned no other answer to the pacific over ture of his master. David Millar, Esq., the present proprietor, has built a large modern House, and fitted up the Castle into a commodious set of offices, still judiciously preserving the appearance of a ruin. BALMACLELLAN, in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright: formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. in money, \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements, and a glebe: the manse, and offices, are in tolerable repair : Patron, The Crown: The Church is in decent condition.

The surface is in general level, except towards the Northern march, where there is a considerable range of pretty high hills. Along the banks ofthe Ken, the soil is chiefly dry, light, and gravelly, and, when properly cultivated, is very abundant : the remainder is also of a light nature, but some times of a deeper moss, and is commonly covered with heath. There are five Lakes, which are plentifully stocked with fish; especially Loch Brack, \"which is remarkable for an excellent sort of trout, of a very large size. The salary of the Parochial School is about \u00a315. Sterling, to which an addition was made some years ago, of the Interest on \u00a3500. bequeathed\" by a Gentleman of the name of Murdoch, late merchant in Glasgow, and a native of this Parish; this fund is secured upon land, which yields more than 5 per cent. : these sums, how ever, are the whole income of the master, as the terms of the donation do not permit him to receive wages. A great advantage to this neighbourhood are its Public Roads, which are kept in excellent repair. This Parish seems to have derived its name from its ancient proprietors: a considerable branch of the Family of Maclellan having, until lately, possessed the lands contiguous to the Church and Village for several centuries, and are supposed to have transferred their name to their property. This family was in great authority so early as the reign of Alexander the Second, in 1217, when David Maclellan is mentioned in a Charter of that King, and Heritable Sheriffs of all Galloway, till the time of jAMES-the Second. Its branches were so numerous and respectable, that there were then in Galloway Twelve Knights of the name of Maclellan, of whom Sir Patrick Maclellan, Tutor of Bombie, was the Chief. He was the eldest son of Sir Patrick, Tutor of Bombie, who lived about the year 1410, and of a daughter of Sir Andrew Gray, of Broxmouth andFoulis, father of Sir Andrew Gray, the first Lord Gray: but, in 1452, happening to take part with Herries, P2"], [172, "B A L of Tereagles, against William Earl Douglas, of Galloway, he was besieged by that Earl in his own Castle of Raeberry, and being cast into close prison in the Earl's Castle of Thrieve, was by him put to death. He was interred in the Abbey of Dundrennan, under a monument bearing a suitable inscription. There upon, his relations, without warrant of authority, making great depredations on Douglas's lands in Galloway, his office of Sheriff was forfeited to the Crown : and, in 1455, the King took the siege of Thrieve Castle upon himself. His son was Sir William, to whom succeeded Sir Thomas, his son, who, in the reign of James the Fourth, was very serviceable to the Crown. In 1547, Sir Thomas gave pledge to serve on the West Border, with 140 men as his Militia force : in 1582, he built the Castle of Kirkcudbright, and died in 1607, leaving three sons ; of whom, Sir Robert, the eldest, was first made a Gentleman ofthe Bed-cham ber by Charles the First, and afterwards created Baron Kirkcudbright, on the 25th of May 1633, with limitation to his heirs male: the Honours still remain, but the family possessions at Kirkcudbright have long since been alienated. BALMADIES, v. RESCOBIE. BALMAGHIE, in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 2 chalders of meal, 1 chalder of bear, \u00a3700. Scotch in money, and \u00a340. Scotch for Communion elements: the manse, and offices, are in good repair : the glebe consists of 14 acres : Patron, Thomas Gordon, Esq. : The Church is in good condition. It is in the Presbytery of Kirkcudbright, and Synod of Galloway. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 969, and, in 1811, was 1132. It is 5 m. N.W. from Castle Douglas. This Parish contains 15,687 acres. The general appearance is un favourable; a great part of it being heath, rocks, and morasses incapable of cultivation; there are, however, some fertile meadows, and the improvements in agriculture have been introduced with success. It is watered by the rivers Ken, and Dee ; and there are five Lakes, which abound with pike, perch, and trout ; especially Grannoch, or Woodhall Loch, which is about a quarter of a mile in breadth, and 2\u00a3 miles in length. Here is a very powerful Chalybeate spring, called Lochenbreck Well, which is much resorted to, and its good effects have been sanctioned by all the Faculty who know its virtues : feus, or building leases, may be had on very moderate terms adjacent to it. The climate is rainy, but not unhealthy. The legal School Salary is 300 merks Scotch, which is divided between two Masters. A small part of the Military Road, from the"], [173, "B A L English Border to Port-Patrick, passes through this Parish on the South ; and the other Parochial roads are in tolerable repair. Peats are abundant. Upon an Island of sixteen Scotch acres, formed by the river Dee, stands the stately Castle of Thrieve, or Thrieff. Here, it is said, was a more ancient Fortress belonging to the old Lords, or Reguli, of Galloway: which being demolished, the present building was erected, but by whom or when is not ascertained, though it is supposed to have been raised by a Douglas. On the ruin of the house of Douglas, and the annexation ofthe Lordship of Galloway to the Crown of Scotland in 1455, this Castle remained in the King's hands, who appointed Captains for the custody thereof, as occasion required. In the year 1502, Sir John Dunbar, of Mochrum, was appointed Keeper of the Castle of Thrieff for nine years. But, in 1524, it was granted to Robert Lord Maxwell, and the longest liver of his sons, and their assigns and tenants, for the space of nineteen years from the feast of St. Martin. The Lords Maxwell, afterwards Earls of Nithsdale, possessed the Heritable Office of Stewards, of the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, and Keepers of the Castle of Thrieff, until the year 1747, when all the Heritable Jurisdictions in Scotland were annexed to the Crown. The Keeper of the Castle of Thrieff received from each of the twenty-seven Parishes in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, what was called a Ladner-Mart Cow, that is, a fat Cow, in such condition as to be fit for killing and salting at Martinmas, for winter provision. These Ladner-Mart Cows were regularly paid to the Earls cf Nithsdale, 'till the forfeiture of the last Earl in 1715, when it went into disuse : But formerly, so attentive were the family to that right, that when, in the year 1704, they sold the estate, upon which the Castle of Thrieff stood, they reserved the Island and Castle, that it might afford them a title to the twenty seven Ladner-Mart Cows belonging to the fortress : and they regularly, by a written Commission, appointed a Captain ofthe Castle of Thrieff. This ruin is now said to be the property of the Laird of Kelton ; but by what means it became private property does not appear, as the Lords Maxwell seem to have holden it only as tenants by a lease from the Crown. During the troubles under King Charles the First, the Earl of Nithsdale held this Castle for the King, and armed, paid, and victualled, a garrison therein of Eighty men, besides officers, all at his own expense ; till at length His Majesty, unable to give him any assistance, directed and authorised him, by Letters bearing date the 15th of September 1640, to make the best conditions he could for himself and the gar rison of this Castle, and also for that of Caerlaverock, wherein he had been for"], [174, "B A L a considerable time besieged. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. This Parish is said to take its name from the family of Maghie, who formerly possessed extensive estates in this part of the Country, and who resided here. BALMAKEWAN, v. MARY KIRK. BALMALCOLM, in the District of Cupar, and Shire of Fife ; in the Parish of Kettle. This is a small Village ; through which the road by Cupar, between the Forth and Tay, passes. BALMALEEDIE, v. MARY KIRK. BALMANGAN, in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright ; and in the Parish of Borgue. Here is a fine old Tower, situate on the Western coast of the Bay of Kirkcudbright: and, at half a mile's distance, within Little Ross, on the West side of that Island, there is a small, but safe harbour. At four hours flood, there is a depth of 12 or 15 feet water for vessels to ride in, either at spring or neap tides ; besides mooring, and sufficient room for twenty large vessels to lie on a soft clay bottom. BALMANO, v. MARY KIRK BALMERINO, or BALMERINACH, in the District of Cupar, and Shire of Fife: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, w&s 8 chalders of victual, and 200 merks Scotch: the manse, and offices, are in tolerable repair: the glebe consists of about 9 acres, and a garden: Patron, The Crown: The Church was re-built in 1812. It is in the Presbytery of Cupar, and Synod of Fife. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 786, and, in 1811, was 921. It is 7 m. N. from Cupar of Fife. This Parish contains upwards of 3000 Scotch acres, stretching along the Southern bank of the Tay; two-thirds of which are arable, and well cultivated. The climate is healthful. The Salary of tlie Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School -fees, and per quisites, and a house, and garden. There is a Ferry-boat from hence to Dundee twice a week, and it is within two miles of the Public Ferry at Woodhaven, where boats ply constantly. The Harbour of Balmerino, which is small, is a Creek belonging to the Custom-house of Dundee : and where great quantities of coals, and lime, are imported. The salmon fishings in the Tay are very valuable. The principal manufacture is that of coarse linens. Several Planta tions have lately been made here, which are in a flourishing condition. The Abbey of Balmerino is pleasantly situate upon the banks of the Tay, and was built, and richly endowed, in 1229, for Monks of the Cistertian Order, who were brought from Melros : it was dedicated to St. Edward and the Virgin Mary."], [175, "B A L Mr. Grose has preserved a view of its ruins, which are much admired. On the 20th of April 1604, King James the Sixth erected Balmerino into a Temporal Lordship, in favour of Sir James Elphinstone, of Barnton, then Principal Se cretary of State, and who had likewise been a Lord of the Session, and Presi dent after Lord Fivie : this dignity was attainted in 1745. BALMUTO, in the District of Kirkaldy, and Shire of Fife : in the Parish of Kinghorn. It is 3| m. W. b. S. from Kirkaldy. This is a compact small estate of good land, lying in a Glen surrounded on all sides by hills or rising ground, and has lately been greatly beautified by strips and clumps of plantation. It is the property of The Right Honourable Claud Irvine Boswell, Lord Balmuto, one of the Judges of The Supreme Court. BALNABREICH, v. BRECHIN.

Murray, Bart. : The Church is in decent repair. It is in the Presbytery of Dunblane, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (including theVillage of Loch-Earn- Head) was 1377, and, in 1811, was 1353. It is 4 m. S. W. from Loch-Earn- Head. This Parish is about 15 miles in length, and about 7 miles in breadth. The surface is very mountainous, and is principally appropriated to the pasturage of sheep. It contains the Lakes of Loch Doine, Loch Voil, and one half of Loch Lubnaig ; which frequently inundate the adjacent plains, and occasion very considerable damage, especially in the months of August or September ; these Lakes are connected by the river Balvag, and abound with salmon, and trout. The climate is very rainy. Fuel is scarce. Besides the Parochial School,"], [176, "BAN there are other two Charity Schools, with small Salaries from the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge in Scotland : one of these is at the Village of Loch-Earn-Head, the other about the middle of Strath-Ire ; these are upwards of 6 miles distant from one another ; and each of them are about 5 miles from the Parochial School. The Gaelic language is generally spoken here. The great Military road, from Stirling to Fort William, passes through the Parish ; and the other Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. See, Methven.

In the year 1290, on the death of Alexander the Third, the Estates of the Kingdom sent Sir Michael Wemyss of Wemyss, and Sir Michael Scot, of Balweary, as Ambassadors to the Court of Norway, to bring home the Princess Margaret, grand daughter to the late King, and undoubted heiress of the Crown of Scotland. These \" Equites Fifani Illustres,\" according to Buchanan, went to Norway ; but unhappily, the Princess died in the Orkneys on her passage to Scotland. The Ruins of the ancient seat, called Balweary Tower, still remain. It gives the title of Baron to the Ancient and Noble family of Leslie, Earl of Leven and Melville. BAMFF, v. ALYTH, and BANFF.

For that part, which is in the Shire of Aberdeen - 235. - 367. It is 4 m. S W. b. S. from Aberdeen. This Parish is situate on both sides of the river Dee, near its confluence with the German Ocean. It extends about 4 miles along the sea coast, and about 7 miles along the banks of the river. The general appearance ofthe country is rugged, and stony, and the hills are mostly covered with heath. The soil is in general light, and either mossy or sandy, but when properly managed is not unfruitful. Agriculture is well attended to, and inclosures are becoming general. The river Dee is not navigable here ; it produces excellent salmon ; but is subject to very sudden, and high floods. The Sea coast is bold, and rocky; and though no part of it affords a safe Harbour for Ships, yet there are very convenient Coves for the Fishing-boats at Findon, Port Lethen, and Dounies. The Climate is healthy. Several Quarries of blue granite are worked here. There are a number of very large cairns, and two Druidical temples that are worthy of notice. The Roads are in bad repair. BANCHORY TARNAN, in the Shire of Kincardine : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a342. Sterling, 4 chalders of victual, one third bear, and the Interest of \u00a3 100. Sterling, mortified for the benefit ofthe Minis ter, by Dr. Alexander Reid, whose father had been Minister here : the manse is very old : the glebe, and toft, want more than one-fourth of an acre of the legal extent : Patron, Sir Robert Burnet, Bart. : The Church was elegantly re-built, in 1775. It is in the Presbytery of Kincardine O'Neil, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population\"of this Parish, in 1801, was 1465, and, in 1811, was 1559. Itis 110 m. N. b. E. from Edinburgh. This Parish is situate on the Northern bank of the river Dee, and contains 19, 125 English acres of land. The surface is very unequal, the greatest part being mossy, and covered with heath. There is plenty of an inferior kind of limestone on both sides of the Dee ; which are adorned with much natural wood, and extensive plantations. A substantial stone bridge, of four arches, has lately been erected over the impetuous river Freuch near its junction with the Dee, by Mr.RussELL, of Blackhall, who has also made good roads leading to it, for a considerable distance, to the great benefit ofthe country. A General Post-Office is established here. The Salary ofthe Grammar School is \u00a316. Sterling ; which, with \u00a31. Sterling set apart for upholding the vol. i. Q"], [178, "BAN School-house, is the annual Interest at 4~ per cent, ofa Sum mortified T>y the late Dr. Alexander Reid, and of \u00a350. Sterling by another gentleman ; no part ofthe Salary being paid by the Heritors or Tenants. There is also a School for the education of young girls ; the fund for tbe maintenance ofthe Mistress being 2000 merks, mortified also by the same benevolent and pious Dr. Reid. The air, near the river, is very salubrious ; but to the Northward, it is unwholesome, from the low marshy fields and mosses; The Loch of Drum, at the Eastern ex tremity, is between two and three miles in circumference : and, near the middle of the Parish, is another of the same dimensions, called The Loch of Leys, in which is an artificial Island with the ruins of some houses upon it. BANDRUM HILL, v. SALINE. BANFF, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Shire of Banff : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 60 bolls of barley, 52 bolls of meal, and \u00a363. Sterling in money, including the Vicarage Tythes converted, and \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements : the glebe, which consists of 7| acres, is a beautiful and fertile field, immediately adjoining the Town ; the manse, and garden-walls, were lately substantially repaired, and an allowance very liberally made by the Heritors of \u00a310. per annum to the Minister, for upholding them ; the garden contains nearly half an acre of ground, and is very productive : Patron, The Earl of Seafield : The Church was elegantly rebuilt in 1789 and 1790, after the model ofthe new church at Dundee ; except an -ancient vaulted Aisle, on the South side, now a burying-place of Lord Banff's Family. It is in the Presbytery of Fordyce, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population ofthis Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 3571, and, in 1811, was 3369. It is 165 m. N. from Edinburgh. The Market, which is on Friday, is well supplied with provisions of all kinds. The Fairs are holden on the first Tuesday, O. S., in February, the third Tuesday, O. S., in May, and the third Tuesday, O. S., in December. A General Post-Office is established here. It is pleasantly situate at the influx of the river Doveron, on a fine declivity, opening to the East and South-East, and commanding various and delightful prospects. It is an ancient Royalty, and the Capital ofthe Shire ; and, in con junction with the Royal Boroughs of Elgin, Cullen, Inverury, and Kintore, send one Member to Parliament. At what precise period it was erected into a Royal Borough is not known : but its privileges were confirmed by King Robert the Second, on the 7th. of October, 1372 ; and, afterwards by James the Sixth, and Charles the Second. It is governed by a Provost, four Baillies, and twelve"], [179, "BAN Counsellors : eight ofthe old Council are re-elected, and the new Counsellors are chosen annually out ofthe Merchant Guild-Brethren. The annual Revenue ofthe Borough amounts to about \u00a3300. Sterling ; arising chiefly from feu-duties, rents of lands, shore dues, and petty customs. The river Doveron, over which is a handsome Bridge of seven arches, and which abounds with salmon and trout, seems frequently to have changed its course : and that piece of low ground on the East side of it, called The Gaivs, now a part ofthe pleasure grounds of The Earl of Fife, was lately the property ofthe Town, is still within the Royalty, and, it is probable, formerly laid on the West bank of the river, which divided the Earldom of Buchan from the County of Banff. The Harbour, which is most use ful and commodious, was finished about the\" year 1775 : but it is subject to the Custom-House at Aberdeen, an inconvenient distance of 45 miles. Here is a neat Town-House, and Prison, on the plan ofthe benevolent Howard. The air is pure, and healthy. There are manufacturies of thread, linen, stockings, ropes, and sails, bricks and tiles, soap and candles ; and a brewery of ale, beer, and porter, is carried on to a considerable extent, and is in high repute. The Bank of Scotland, and the Banking Company in Aberdeen, have each of them estab lished a branch in this Town. During the late war, a small Battery was erected on the high ground near the Harbour ; on which are mounted two 18 pounders, four 12 pounders, and two field pieces. The public Schools of Banff, which are entirely under the direction ofthe Magistrates (for there is no Parochial establish ment), were connected together, and converted into an Academy, in the year 1786 : this Seminary has answered the expectations of all concerned, and, by the great care and diligence of able and meritorious Teachers, is now in a flourishing state : there is also an excellent Establishment for the education ofthe Children of the Poor; besides two English Schools, and two reputable Boarding- Schools for the education of young Ladies. Banff has, for several years, been the residence and occasional resort of many genteel, opulent, and respectable Families; and, in few Provincial Towns, are the Inhabitants more distinguished for general information, social intercourse, and urbanity of manners. By the liberality and munificence of the late George Smith, Esq., a sum of money was bequeathed, for the express purpose of building an Infirmary here ; and such an useful Institution will prove a most substantial benefit to this part of the country. Here is a small Hospital or Bede-House, which affords lodging to eight poor decayed women ; but it has no other endow ment than what is derived from the Parochial funds, and the donations of Q2"], [180, "BAN charitable individuals. There was a Convent of Carmelites, or White Friars here, consecrated to the Virgin Mary, and which was probably established by Alexander the Third : two of their Cells are still to be seen, near the Old Church, in a pretty entire state : the beautiful green Mount in Lord Fife's Park, and another of inferior size, situate in the middle of the Town, formed a part of their territory : and, on the Mount in Duff House Park, are still remem bered the ruins and foundation of their Chapel, around which was the conse crated ground ofthe Sepulchre : here many human bones were discovered, and by the care of Lord Fife deposited in a large Urn, elevated on a Pedestal, near the Mount: in the same ground, on an eminence, overhanging the river Doveron, his Lordship has built an elegant Mausoleum ; the ancient monuments in which, brought from the family burying-place in the Aisle of Cullen, are elegantly delineated and described by the late Reverend and ingenious Charles Cordiner, who was a native of this place. Banff was a part of the ancient Thanedom of Boin, whence the name seems to be derived : in some old Char ters it is spelled Boineffe and Baineffe : the District of Loin has probably received its name from a conspicuous Mountain in the neighbourhood of Cullen, called The B inn: on the South side ofthis Hill, at Darbrich, the Forrester had his dwelling ; and it is well known that the Forrestry, and Thanedom Territory, extended thence to the Borough lands of Banff, being divided only by the water of Boindie. The Castle of Banff was a Constabulary of old : it was a place of strength, and said to be occasionally the residence of the King, when visiting this part of his dominions : in His Majesty's absence, it was the mansion of the Thane, Sheriff, or Constable, and the seat where Justice was administered. The office of Sheriff continued to be annexed to the Castle, until thc year 1636, when the Sheriffdom was resigned by The Earl of Buchan to Sir James Baird, of Auchmedden ; and the Castle was transferred to Mr. Sharp, the father ofthe Archbishop of St. Andrew's ; from whom it afterwards came into the Noble family of Seafield. The Castle and adjoining grounds hold of the Crown blanche, and pay neither cess, stipend, nor any burden whatever. The Sheriff's office was resigned in 1681, by Baird, of Auchmedden, to the Earl of Seafield, who enjoyed the right, until the abolition of Heritable Jurisdictions, in 1748. Part of the ancient Wall is yet entire ; and the remains of the moat, and en trenchments, are still visible : except a small adjoining House, the residence of Archbishop Sharp's father, the Castle is now a plain modern building, long the residence of the late Countess Dowager of Findlater, a Lady not more"], [181, "BAN distinguished for her high rank, than by the unassuming manners, and unwearied benevolence, which adorned her character : its situation is uncommonly pleasing and romantic, and few Seats can boast ofa greater variety of charming prospects. Near to the Castle was situate the Chaplainry of the The Holy Rood. Duff House, the magnificent Mansion of The Earl of Fife, was planned by the late Mr. Adam : it contains a great profusion of Paintings, chiefly Portraits, and a well selected Library, and a Cabinet of Coins : the Park, and surrounding Plan- tations, measure 14 miles in ci_rcumference ; the former being bounded by the two Bridges of Banff and Al vah, and comprising within its circuit a part of the Counties of Aberdeen and Banff, and ofthe Parishes of Banff, Gamrie, Alvah, and King Edward. Banff gave the title of Baron to the Noble Family of Ogilvie, now extinct. \u2014 TheParish of Banff forms an irregular, oblong figure, stretching from North to South-West above six miles, and in breadth, from a mile and a half to two miles and a half; and contains about 7680 acres. The surface is in general beautifully unequal, and rises gradually to the South-West : the nature and quality of the soil are various, being a rich fertile loam, deep strong clay, sandy, and a thin gravelly bottom : the sea-coast of the Moray Firth, for half a mile Westward of the Harbour, is bold and rocky: towards the water of Boindie it forms a fine sandy beach, adjoining which is The Links, affording an excellent field for the healthful exercises of Riding, and the Golf. The Earl of Seafield, The Earl of Fife, and Sir George Abercrombie, are the principal Proprietors ; of whom, The Earl of Fife is the only residing Heritor. Great improvements in agriculture have been introduced here by these public-spirited Proprietors, and The Banfeshire Farming Society. The ancient Forest of Boin is destroyed; but vast plantations have been made, which are all in a flourishing condition. The Well of Boindie ,** a powerful Chalybeate, has been found bene- ficial in many diseases. Auchmedden was long the residence of the very ancient and respectable Family of Baird : This Parish also gave birth to James Sharp, D. D., Archbishop of St. Andrew's, and Primate of Scotland, whose tragical end, on the 3d of May 1679, exhibits a melancholy instance of the furious and misguided zeal of ancient times. The Castle of Inch-Druar, on the estate of the late Lord Banff (into whose family the lands of the Barony came, in 1627), is situate on a fine rising ground, about sour miles South-West from the Town : it is still entire, and habitable : by the style of architecture, it seems to have been built about the time of King James the Fourth or Fifth. Mr. Grose has preserved a View of it. The new Turn-pike road from"], [182, "BAN Aberdeen, Turreff, and Peterhead pleads through the Town, and the Mail-Coach passes three times a week, on its way to Inverness ; Turn-pike roads also branch off to Huntley, and Keith ; and one is conducted as far as Mortlach, at the extremity of the county: These are public benefits, and which, it is hoped, are only the precursors of still greater improvements. Banff is in tlie Latitude of 57\u00b0 40' 30\" North, and the Longitude of 2D 23' West from the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. This is supposed to have been the Roman Station, Ad Selinam. BANFF, SHIRE. This Shire is situate within the Fifty-Eighth degree of North Latitude, and extends from Banff to Garmouth, along the South Shore of the Moray Firth, its Northern Boundary, about 24 English miles : The length from the Bay of Cullen, in a South-West direction to Loch Avon, its Southern boundary, is 50 miles : It preserves a mean length of nearly 20 miles, till within five miles of that Lake, where it is suddenly compressed into a breadth of little more than three miles, making a superficies of 1015 square miles, or 649,600 English acres. The whole extent, except the tract along the sea-shore, may very properly be described as a hilly, mountainous country, interspersed with a great many fertile vallies, well adapted to the cultivation of corn and grass. The hills are either covered with heath or moss, affording little pasture ; while, from their bleak and barren aspect, they have a very gloomy and unpleasant appear ance. The arable land, which bears but a small proportion to the waste, lies on the sides, and towards the bottoms of the higher hills\", or on the sides of those vallies through which the waters have their courses, or on the narrow level plains on the banks of those waters. From the nature of the soil, as well as from its generally exposed situation, and the great height of many ofthe mountains, this District is often subjected to all the evils ofa cold and rainy climate. The lower part ofthe country, however, from Duff- House to Forglen and Kinnairdy, a tract of about twelve miles along the river side, and from Banff to Gordon Castle, including the Districts of Boyne and Enzie, are nearly equal to the climate of Moray, and greatly surpass the most part of that County in the fertility of its soil, the improvements of its agriculture, and the richness of its productions. The Resident Population of this Shire, in 1801, was 35,807, and, in 1811, was 36,668. It sends one Member to Parliament. It is watered by the rivers Spey, Avon, Fiddich, and Doveron ; besides many other small rivulets, which fall into the Firth at different places along the coast, and which serve to turn the machi nery of the corn mills erected upon them, and also the machinery necessary for"], [183, "BAN carrying on different branches of manufactures established in that part of the country, particularly at Banff, Boyndie, Portsoy, and Cullen.

In the bequest, a right of presenting the poor person, or persons, to whom the Interest of it is to be given, is reserved to the heir of entail. BANNISKIRK, v. HALKIRK. BANNOCK-BURN, in the Shire of Stirling; and in the Parish of St. Ninian's. It is situate on the Northern bank ofthe small river Bannock, at the distance of 3 m. S. from Stirling. Of late cotton-cloth, and for a long time, all the tartan used by the army, has been manufactured at this village. Here is an extensive Colliery. This Village is celebrated for the Battle, between Robert Bruce and Edward the Second, in which the latter, with every superiority in point of numbers and disposition, was completely defeated. This Battle, the Pride of the Scottish Warrior, was fought on Monday, the 24th of June, 1314: and so sure was Edward of success, that he brought with him a Carmelite Friar ofthe name of William Baston, one ofthe best Poets of his age, that he might witness and celebrate the victory : the Poet was taken prisoner, but obtained his liberty, on condition of composing a Poem in honour of the victorious Scots: this Poem is still extant, in Latin, and is a literary curiosity. At this place, that unfortunate monarch James the Third was defeated by his rebellious subjects ; who, in his flight, falling down from his horse, and being bruised by the accident,"], [184, "BAR was taken into a neighbouring mill, and soon after assassinated by a Priest who had been called in to receive his confession, and afford him Spiritual assistance. The Fairs are holden on the second Tuesday, O. S., in June, and the second Tuesday, O. S., in October. .. . p a.,svf 7-Aaa*joM BANTON, in the Shire of Stirling; and in the Parish of KilJsyth. It is 1\u00a3 ra. N. E. from Killsyth. This Estate is situate in the East Barony. Here is a School, which is generally well attended, though tlie encouragement to the teacher is riot very great : he has a dwelling-house ; and William Cadell, Esq. , pro prietor of the Estate of Banton, has annually contributed in the most liberal manner to his support. BARBISTON, CASTLE, v. DALRYMPLE. B ARBRECK, in the District of Inverary, and Shire of Argyle : in the Parish of Kill-Martin. It is situate at the head of Loch Craignish. This was the Estate of the Ancient and Illustrious family of Campbell, lineally descended from Sir Colin Campbell, of Lochoiv, who early distinguished himself for Military achievements, and was in the expedition made into Ireland, in 1316, in behalf of Edward Bruce, then King of that Realm, where he behaved with exceeding gallantry, and performed many signal services: in consideration whereof he obtained a grant of divers lands in the Shire of Argyle, by a Charter yet extant ; and faithfully conducted himself during the whole reign of King Robert the First, from whom he had obtained a Charter of confirmation of the Barony of .Lochoiv, under the Great Seal ofthe Kingdom. He maried a Daughter of the family of Lenox, by whom he had three sons and a daughter: viz., I.Archibald, his Successor, and Progenitor of the Dukes of Argyle, \u2014 2. John Campbell, Ancestor of the branch of Barbreck, from whom descended Campbell, of Succouch. Frederick William Campbell, Esq., is the present most respect able Chief of the Campbells of the Barbreck Line ; but this their paternal Estate was sold by his Grandfather, the late Colonel Charles Campbell, and now belongs to Campbell, of Loch-Nell.

The ancient Family of Moubray were originally Proprietors here ; the name of Philip Moubray, of Barnbougle, occurring about the year 1200. In the reign of Robert Bruce, it was forfeited by Roger Moubray, and granted to Murdoch Monteith. But this Barony, which comprehended the lands of Easter Cragie, seems to have been restored to the forfeited Family, in the person of Philippa Moubray. In that name the Estate remained till the year 1620, when Sir Robert Moubray sold it : and his representative, it is said, is still in the Parish, but reduced to the condition ofa common Servant. Barnbougle Castle still remains entire, and is inhabited, but is no ways remarkable, except for its singular situation within the sea mark, and the strength of its embrazures fronting the Forth. It is now the property of The Earl of Roseberry. BARNS, EAST, in the Shire of Hadington ; and in the Parish of Dunbar. A Village, at the distance of 3. m. S. E. from Dunbar. It is situate upon the German Ocean. Here is a private School with a small Salary, being the Interest of \u00a3100.

BARNS, WEST, in the Shire of Hadington; and in the Parish of Dunbar. A Village, at the distance of \\\\ m. W. from Dunbar. It is situate on the river Biel, and has several Mills. Here is also a Rope-walk. In 1790, a Parochial School was established here by the Heritors, with a Salary of \u00a38.. 6.. 8. Sterling, since increased to 300 merks, and which has been found very beneficial in this populous Village. BARN-YARDS, in the District of St. Andrew's, and Shire of Fife : in the Parish of Killconquhar. This is a small Village, containing, in 1793, about 198 Inhabitants: it is adjacent to the Village of Killconquhar, of which it may be said to form a part, although it still retains a separate name. BARO, v. BARRA. BAROCHAN, v. HOUSTON, BARONY of GLASGOW, within the Jurisdiction ofthe City of Glasgow, and Shire of Lanark : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, before the late augmentation, was about \u00a3165. including the value ofthe glebe, consisting of 6y acres, and the rent allowed by the Heritors in lieu of a manse : Patron, The vol. i. R"], [186, "BAR Crown : The Parish Church was a part of that venerable building, The Cathe- dral of Glasgow, and had been occupied by the inhabitants ofthe Barony since the year 1595 ; but, being of an arched roof, which is low, and supported by a great number of massy pillars, it is exceedingly dark, dirty, and incommodious. The Heritors, therefore, about ten or twelve years ago, have built an elegant and commodious Church, in the Gothic stile, on the South side ofthe Cathedral, and have appropriated their old Church for a cemetery. It is in the Presbytery of Glasgow, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (including the villages of Calton and Bridgeton, Graham's- Town, Anderston, Finnieston, Clayslap, North Woodside, Cowcaddens, Park- House, Camlachie, Park-Head, West Muir, Shettleston and Middle-Quarter, Lightburn, Callendar and Denniston, and Sandy-Hills) was 26,710, and, in 1811, was 37,216. The City of Glasgow, and the Barony Parish, were compre- hended under one Parochial district, until the year 1595 ; when the Population having so much increased, it was found more convenient to have them disjoined; and the Land-ward part of the Parish, as distinguished from the City, was denominated The Barony. This Parish is both large and populous, extending from two to six miles around the City, except on the South side, where the river Clyde forms the boundary. The soil is in general fertile ; but by far the greater part is covered with the extensive Villages, which constitute a part rather than the Suburbs ofthe City. The side cuts from the Great Canal, and the Monk- land Canal, intersect the Parish, and are of the greatest consequence in pro- moting the numerous manufactures. Coals, and free-stone, are in great abund- ance. The climate is moist, but not unhealthy. Nearly one-third ofthe valued rent of the Parish is holden by The College of Glasgow, as the Teind of the Archbishoprick: and the greatest part of The New Town of Glasgow is situate within the Barony. Education is so cheap here, as to be within the reach ofthe poorest Inhabitant. An Act of Parliament has lately been obtained for feuing the glebe, which, from its vicinity to the City of Glasgow, promises to advance the value of the benefice very much. BARR, in the District of Cantyre, and Shire of Argyle ; and in the Parish of Killean. It is 12 m. NW. b. N. from Campbell-Town. Here is a tolerable Inn. It is situate upon the Atlantic Ocean, near which is the great Cave of Bealach-a '-chaochain. BARR, in the District of Carrick, and Shire of Ayr: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150.: the manse is in tolerable repair: the"], [187, "BAR glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Patron, The Crown : The Church was built about the year 1653, when it was disjoined from the Parishes of Girvan and Dailly, and erected into a separate Parish. It is in the Presbytery of Ayr, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 742, and, in 1811, was 728. It is 12 m. S. from Maybole. This is a very extensive Parish, and is principally appropriated to pasturage. About a mile South-West from the Church, upon the banks of the small river Stincher, are the remains of a Chapel, and near it a small Farm-house, where a great annual Fair is holden on the last Saturday of May, called Kirk Domin\u00e6 Fair. Limestone is abundant ; but coals have not yet been discovered. BARRA, in the Shire of Hadington : an ancient Vicarage, now compre hended in the Parish of Garvald : The Church is demolished. The Village is small, and thinly inhabited. It is 4 m. S. E. from Hadington. See, Garvald. BARRAS, v. DUNOTTAR. BARRA Y, ISLAND, one of the Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was2 chalders of meal, and 900 merks Scotch, of which 300 are paid out of the unaffected Teinds of South Uist, together with 50 merks for Communion elements : tliere is no manse, but \u00a310. per annum is allowed in lieu of it : the glebe is a small Farm, given by the Heritor to the Presbytery, when this place was erected into a Parish, on condi tion that every Incumbent should pay 46 merks Scotch yearly rent : and which may be valued at \u00a312. : Patron, The Crown : There are three Places of Wor ship, viz. Killbar, Borve, and Watersay : the Minister preaches two Sundays at Borve, which is only a mile and a half from his own house ; the third Sunday at Killbar, at the distance of three miles ; and the fourth, at Watersay, which, in cluding a Ferry of one mile, is at the distance of five miles. The Inhabitants of the South Isles are all Roman Catholics ; the Priest goes there only twice a year, unless by a particular call to visit the sick, and to administer extreme unction. What renders this Parish singularly troublesome, is its distance from the Seats of Presbytery, and Synod : \u2014 the Seat of the Presbytery is in North Uist, at the distance of 40 miles, besides a Ferry of 8 miles, where the Minister attends two stated Presbyteries in the year, one of them in the beginning of December, and the other in the middle of March ; besides occasional Meetings, and attend ance upon Sacraments in North Uist and Harris, the last of which is at the dis tance of nearly 60 miles, besides the Ferry already mentioned, and another between North Uist and Harris, which is 12 miles in length; \u2014 The Seat ofthe R2"], [188, "BAR Synod, which isGlen-Elg, on the Continent of Scotlaud, is at the distance of 30 leagues by sea, when the Minister must be at the expense ofthe Boat and Crew; and, if he goes from hence to North Uist, to take passage by the Packet-boat to Dunvegan, and then through Skye, the distance is much greater, and the expenses more considerable. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Islands of Barray, Watersay, Sanderay, Pabay, Mengalay, Ber neray, Flodday, Keillesay, and. Gigay) was 1925, and, in 1811, was 2114. The Main Island of Barray is 8 computed miles in length, and from 2 to 4 miles in breadth, being intersected in different places by arms ofthe sea. It has a barren appearance, from the great quantity of rock to be seen every where, excepting the North end, which, for its fertility, if the climate were equally good, might be compared to any of the same extent in any part of Scotland. In the middle, and South end, are very high hills, and some flat ground ; the hills are a mixture of verdure, rock, and heath ; and seem to be better calculated for sheep pasture, than for rearing black cattle, but lie at too great a distance from Market. The soil is, in general, thin, and rocky ; and, in some parts, there is a great deal of sand, which is blown about by every gale of wind, and is often very injurious. By the example and encouragement of Roderick Macneil, Esq., agriculture is much improved here. The Tenants pay their rents by manufacturing Kelp, and the sale of their Cattle. The Superiority ofthe Island is in the Noble Family of Macdonald. On the East Coast, great quantities of cod and ling are annually taken ; the fishing banks extending from the mouth of Loch Boisdale to Barray- Head. Here are five Danish Duns. In Killbar are two Churches, built by the Monks of I-Columb-Kill : there is another also at Borve, which is dedicated to St. Michael. On the South end of the Island is Kisimul Bay, or Castle Bay, where there are the remains ofa Castle, which was the residence ofthe Lairds of Barray, till the beginning of the Eighteenth Century. There are also several Druidical Temples; and a few mineral springs. The Society for propagating Christian Knowledge have established a School here, with a Salary of \u00a315. \u25a0 the Heritor has built a good School-house, as also a house for the Master, and has furnished him with all the conveniences required by the Society. The Gaelic is the only language commonly spoken ; and, it is said, with greater purity than in any other place. The Weather is rather inconstant ; the West and South- West winds blow most frequently here, and often prove very destructive to corn. Very little snow falls here. The surrounding Islands are fertile in corn, and grass, but are also liable to be blasted by the South-West winds : they are very"], [189, "BAR difficult of access, on account of the strong Currents running between them, and landing is sometimes not only troublesome, but hazardous. The Island of Bar ray, with all the surrounding Islands, are the property of Roderick Macneil, Esq., of Barray, whose predecessors are said to have been in possession of them before the Danes, and were the first of that name who came from Ireland, whence they derive their Pedigree ; so that they have always been acknowledged the Chief of the Macneils in Scotland. The present Name of the Parish seems to be derived from St. Barr, she Tutelar Saint ofthe Island, and to whose memory the 25th. of September is dedicated as a Holiday : on this day the Roman Catholic Priest says Mass, and all those of that Religion used punctually to attend ; after Mass, the people amused themselves with horse-races, and spent the evening in mirth and conviviality: but, of late years, this custom has been much on the de cline. Formerly, there was an image ofthe Saint in the Church-yard of Shilbar (the principal Place of Worship, and probably the Burial-Place of the Saint), which was clothed with a linen shirt every year upon his own Anniversary. The Uninhabited Islands belonging to this Parish, are the two Crean-Mulls, Crinamil, Fiaray, the three Fladdays, Fudia, Griskay, Lingay, Muldonich, Snoassumul, and Wia. BARREL of BUTTER, one of the Orkneys; and constituting part of the Parish of Orphir. Here was formerly a Seal fishery, for which the neighbour ing Farmer paid the Proprietor a Barrel of Oil yearly, until the frequency of Shipping scared them from the Rock : when the Proprietor, determining not to lose his rent, converted the Tack-duty into a Barrel of Butter ; which is still paid by the Tenant, and thence the rock is said to derive its present name. Its ancient name was Carlin Skerry. BARR-HEAD, in the Shire of Renfrew : and in the Parish of Neilston This is a considerable, manufacturing Village. BARR-HILL, v. COLMONELL. BARRIE, inthe Shire of Forfar: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., together with a glebe, and \u00a38. .6.. 8. for Communion ele ments ; the manse is in tolerable repair : Patron, The Crown : The Church is old, and in bad condition. It is in the Presbytery of Aber-Brothock, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population' of this Parish, in 1801, was 886, and, in 1811, was 1046. It is 9 m. E. N. E. from Dundee. This Parish is about four miles in length, and three miles in breadth, stretching along the North Coast of the Firth of Tay. A high verdant bank runs through the whole extent,"], [190, "BAR from East to West, which divides it -into two parts, that are very different in soil and appearance : the Northern district being sandy, and affording only a scanty pasture for sheep : but the Southern district is a fine light loam, extremely fer- tile, and well cultivated. The chief manufacture is brown linen ; and this Parish has long been famous for the excellence of that fabric, and the superiority of the workmanship : the greatest part is stamped, and sold at the market of Aber- Brothock. The Salary of the Parocial School, which has been uniformly well conducted, is 300 merks, and perquisites. There are two Light-Houses, on the- banks ofthe Tay, to guide the mariner in safety through the sand banks, which are very numerous at the mouth of the Firth : the largest, which is stationary, is a circular stone building erected upon piles : the other is a moveable wooden fabric, raised on rollers : when the two lights are seen in one, the pilot may navigate the river without fear. The expense of the lights is defrayed by a small tax on the tonnage of the vessels which enter the Tay. Although this Parish has no regular harbour, the surrounding beach nevertheless affords a safe landing place to small vessels ; by which lime, the staple manure, and coals, the chief article of fuel, are imported from the Firth of Forth, and sold at a reasonable rate. A rigorous astriction to a Barony Mill is loudly complained of. On the Eastern boundary, are many tumuli ; and on the adjoining estate of Carnoustie , i. e. Tlie Cairn of Heroes, are the vestiges ofa camp of great extent, where the Danes, under Camus, were totally defeated by the Scottish army under Malcolm the Second. Buchanan relates {lib. 6. cap. 50), that the engagement was so desperate, that the neighbouring brook ran with blood for three days. Some 'of these tumuli have been lately opened, and found to contain human skeletons, in a perfect state. BARROCH, v. WICK. BARROGIL CASTLE, v. CANISBAY. BARRULE, NORTH and SOUTH, two lofty Mountains in the Isle of Man. BARRY-HILL, or BARRA-HILL, in the Shire of Perth; and in the Parish of Meigle. Upon the summit ofthis hill, are the remains of an extensive British Fort. It is now called, by the tradition of the country, Cumyris Camp, from the defeat which The Earl of Buchan there sustained, when attacked by the gallant Bruce. Mr. Chalmers has preserved a plan and sections of it. BARSELL HILL, v. TINWALD. BARSKEOCH, v. DALRY. BARSKIMMING, v. STAIR."], [191, "BAS BAR VAS, in the Isle of Lewis, and Shire of Ross: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a380..11..0., including the allowances for Com- munion elements, and the glebe : the manse is small, but in good repair: Patron, The Crown: The Church was lately re-built; besides which, there is another Church, called St. Peter's, in the district of Ness, at about 12 computed miles from the manse. It is in the Presbytery of Lewis, and Synod of Glenelg. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 2233, and, in 1811, was 2165. It is 10 m. N. W. from Stornoway. This is an extensive Parish, constituting the Northern extremity ofthe Isle of Lewis, and is computed to be 24 miles in length, and 9 miles in breadth, on the average. The surface of the whole Parish is pretty plain, except a few hills at a considerable distance from the sea, and some small glens through which the rivulets flow. The soil is various, but tolerably fertile; and agriculture is much improved here of late. The sea-coast is bold and rugged, with a tremendous surf or swell upon it, when the wind blows from the West and North-West. There is not a single harbour where a vessel can anchor, aud but a few creeks where boats can land, even in the finest weather. The air, though moist, is salubrious. It is wholly destitute of wood. The principal fishing is that of dog-fish, from the liver of which a considerable quantity of oil is extracted. There is a Charity School in the District of Ness: and Lady Seaforth, whose patriotic zeal and benevolence is so conspicuous, has generously erected two Spinning-Schools, with a Salary of \u00a36. Sterling to each ofthe Mistresses: and, as a spur to industry and emulation, annual com- petitions are holden, when premiums are given to the best spinners. There are the ruins of several Popish Chapels; and round most of them are burying- grounds, which are still in use. Here are a vast variety of wild geese and ducks, and the coast abounds with a variety of sea-fowls. Peats are abundant. The Gaelic is the common language. See, Lewis. BASSENDEAN, or BASING-DENE, in the Shire of Berwick: an incient Vicarage, which formerly belonged to the Nuns |of Coldstream : The Church, which is now in ruins, stood near the Mansion-House, on the South- East; and the walls still inclose the burying place of the Homes, of Bassendean. Soon after the Reformation, Andrew Currie, Vicar of Bassendean, conveyed to William Home, the third son of Sir James Home, of Colden-knows, \" terras ecclesiasticas, mansionem, et glebam vicari\u00e6 de Bassendene:\" whereupon, he obtained from James the Sixth a Charter for the same, on the 11th of February 1573-4: this William, who thus built his house upon Church lands, was the"], [192, "BAT progenitor ofthe present family here : and it appears, that the Minister of West Struther is still entitled to six days casting* of turf on the Lands of Mr. Home. See, West Struther. BASS, ISLAND, off the Shire of Hadington; and part of the Parish of North Berwick. This is a small Island or insulated Rock, of stupendous height, within the Firth of Forth, about a mile distant from the South shore, and inac cessible on all sides, except by one narrow passage. Upon the summit of this Rock, is a spring which furnished water sufficient for the Garrison of a small Castle : there is also pasture for 20 or 30 sheep, and a small Warren of Rabbits : it is frequented by countless flocks of sea birds, which continue here during the summer, and almost cover the surface with their nests, eggs, and young: among which is the Solan Goose. The Island of the Bass was an ancient possession of the family of Lauder, who, for a long time, refused to sell it, though solicited so to do by several ofthe Scottish Kings. However, the family at length coming to decay, it was, in the year 1671, purchased by King Charles the Second, during; whose reign, and that of his Brother James the Second, it was made a State Prison, where the Western people, in those days called Cameronians, were confined for being in arms against the King. After the Revolution a despe rate crew of people got possession of it; and having a large boat, which they hoisted up on the rock, or let down at pleasure, committed several piracies, took a great many vessels, and held out the last of any place in Great Britain for King James: but their boat being at length either seized or lost, and not receiv ing their accustomsd supply of provisions from France, they were obliged to surrender. A Cavern runs through this rock from North West to South East: it is quite dark in the centre, where there is a deep pool of water ; from thence it widens towards both apertures, that at the South- East side being the highest. This Island was soon after its surrender given to President Dalrymple, and is still in the possession of his Family. It is said to have been the residence of St. Baldred. BATHGATE, in the Shire of Linlithgow: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3142., together with a glebe, and four chalders of vic tual; the manse is old: Patron, The Earl of Hopetoun: The Church was erected, in 1739.

This Parish is about 7 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth: towards the North East, it is hilly; and the Bathgate Hills are the most elevated in this part of the country ; to wards the South, the surface is level: the soil is tolerablv good, and agriculture is much attended to. Here are extensive Quarries of free-stone ; and there is also abundance of coal, and an inexhaustible quantity of moss The Roads are in pretty good repair. The Barony of Bathgate was part of the extensive posses sions which were given by King Robert Bruce, in 1316, as the dowry of his daughter Lady Margery, to Walter, High Steward of Scotland, who had one of his principal residences at this place, and where he died in 1328: the foun dations ofthe House are still visible, in the midst ofa morass, about a quarter of a mile distant from the Town ; and several Causeways leading to it, still remain. On the 4th of June 1663, Charles the Second granted to Thomas Hamilton, of Bathgate, the Barony, with the Office of Sheriff of Bathgate. And, on the abolition of Hereditary Jurisdictions, in 1747, John Earl of Hopetoun claimed \u00a32000. for the Sheriffdom of this place. The Muslin manufacture, which is a chief branch of trade here, is now on the decline. BATTLEBY, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Redgorton.

A General Post- Office is established here. The great North road from Edinburgh, by the Queen's Ferry, goes through it. This Parish is about 4 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth. The surface is hilly, and a great part of the soil is moorish and wet : it is considerably behind the neighbouring country in agricultural vol. i. S"], [194, "B E A improvements, and the inclosures are not yet completed. It abounds with excel lent game, and contains a small Lake, called Loch Fitty, which is well stocked with perch, and pike. The climate is healthy. It abounds every where with coal, and contains some lime-stone. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites. Much of the Parish belongs to small resident proprietors, who have long been remarked for their retired life and insulated habits, though they are now neither so numerous as formerly, nor so different from others in their manners. Tlie Hill of Beath is a beautiful and conspicuous object, cultivated to its summit, which commands one of the finest and most extensive views in Scotland, comprehending the Metro polis, and a great part ofthe Firth of Forth. It is in contemplation to erect a Monument upon it, to the Memory of Sir William Wallace, as a testimony of the veneration entertained by the Members of The Crossgates Club, and other Gentlemen in Fife, for that distinguished Patriot : though it was not the Scene of any of his Exploits. BEATON'S MILL, v. NINIANS, ST. BEAUFORT, v. KILLTARLATY. BEAULY, or BEAULIEU, in the Shire of Inverness ; and in the Parish of Killmorack. It is 166 m. N. b. W. from Edinburgh. Here is a General Post- Office. This is a very flourishing Village, situate at the mouth of the river Beauly, where it discharges itself into a Loch or Firth ofthe same name. The river is navigable for small vessels, about three miles above the Village : and Vessels of upwards of 90 tons burden are occasionally built here. The greatest part ofthe Walls of the ancient Priory are still standing, which was founded in the year 1230, by John Bisset, of Lovat, whose Charter was confirmed by Pope Gregory. On the Dissolution of Religious Houses, Hugh Lord Fraser, of Lovat, acquired this Priory from the last Prior thereof, and transmitted it to his Posterity, with whom it still remains. The situation of the Town of Beauly at the head of the Moray Firth, renders it the necessary thoroughfare to and from all the more Northern Highland Counties ; and necessarily encouraged the expectation that a Bridge should be built here* The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, in their Fifth Report of April 1811, observe, \" On application ofthe General Meeting of the County of Inverness, an Act was passed in the last Session of Parliament (50\u00b0 Geo. III. c. 87.), .

BEDRULE, or BETHOC-RULE, in the District of Jedburgh, and Shire of Roxburgh: formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., together with a manse, and glebe : Patron, Joseph Hume, Esq., of Nine- Wells: The Church is in a ruinous state. It is in the Presbytery of Jedburgh, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (containing the Villages of Bedrule, Fulton, Newton, and Rue-Castle) was 260, and, in 1811, was 235. It is 4. m. S. W. from Jedburgh. This Parish is about 4 miles in length, and from 2 to 3 miles in breadth. The soil is, in general, good, and well cultivated. The surface is various, exhibiting sudden and unexpected transitions from Hill to Dale. The climate is also unequal, according to the situation in the vallies, or more elevated ground. The appear ance of coal is very flattering ; but, as yet, none has been discovered Here is abundance of excellent freestone. The Roads from Berwick to Carlisle, and from London to Edinburgh, in passing through this Parish, are remarkable for the variety and beauty ofthe prospects which they unfold It is situate on the East side of the river Rule. During the early part of the Twelfth century, this Manor, with the adjoining Manor of Rughe- Chester, which now forms the Barony of Rue- Castle, were enjoyed by a Lady ofthe name of Bethoc, who, it is said, not only gave her name to this Parish, but gave birth *to a long line of heroes, and heroines. But, as the Name is usually pronounced Bed de Ride, its origin is otherwise explained ; and, it is thought, that it signifies The Seat or Resting-place of Rule or Reg ulus, probably the Tutelar Saint of the Parish; S2"], [196, "B E I whilst others again derive it, from the rapidity of its stream, being also written Roul or Roll, in some old papers. The Chief of the family of Turnbull, a branch ofthe very ancient family of Rule, had his principal residence at Bedrule Castle, formerly a strong hold, and pleasantly situate on the bank of the river, but which has long been demolished. There are plainly the vestiges of a regular encampment, on an elevated ground, and surrounded by a mound of earth, almost at an equal distance between Bedrule, and Newton : from ils figure, it appears to have been British : There is another encampment, at the distance of about half a mile to the Eastward, surrounded by a mound and fosse, and which, from its square form, seems to have been Roman : They are both of small size, and occupy an area nearly of the same extent. There are two Bridges in the Parish, both of them across the river Rule ; one being near the Village of Spital, on the great Road, between Berwick arul Carlisle, consisting of two arches ; and the other, consisting of one arch, on the road from Hawick, by Bedrule, to Jed burgh. The Schoolmaster's Salary is 300 merks, and perquisites, but his School-house is almost a ruin. In this Parish is the lofty Mountain Dunian. BEECHWOOD, v. CORSTORPHINE. BEEKTON, v. DRYFE'S-DALE.

The Market is on Friday. The principal Fair is holden on the 30th of August, when there is a fine show of horses. A General Post-Office is established here. It is situate upon an eminence, and has a considerable trade in the manufacture of linen, and of silk gauze. The Salary of the Paro chial School is 300 merks (subject to a certain deduction, to be divided equally"], [197, "BEL among the teachers of three small Schools in the country), together with School fees. Both peats, and coals, are used for fuel; but chiefly the latter, which are plentifully supplied from the neighbouring Parishes. Here are three Charitable Societies, which are found to be very beneficial. The great Road from Glasgow to Port-Patrick, by Paisley, passes through the Town. This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and 4 miles in breadth, besides four farms which are situate in the Shire of Renfrew. The soil is fertile, and well cultivated; and particular attention is paid to the management of the Dairy. The climate is rainy, and not very healthy. There were formerly several Castles in this district, all of which are now demolished, except one, that forms a stately ruin, and was anciently the seat of the Montgomeries, of Giffan. The impolitic servitude of thirlage is justly and loudly complained of here. BELEPHETRICH, v. TIR-Y, ISLAND. BELHAVEN, in the Shire of Hadington ; and within the Parish, and Royalty of Dunbar. It is f m. W. from Dunbar, and is a Suburb to it. In 1647, Sir John Hamilton, of Broomhill, was created Lord Belhaven and Stenton, but having no male heirs, made a surrender of his Barony to the King, and obtained a new Patent, limiting the honours to Sir John Hamilton, of Beil, Bart., (who had married his eldest Grand-daughter, Margaret) and his heirs male. The late Lord Robert Hamilton, of Whishaw, married Susan, daugh ter of Sir Michael Balfour, Bart., and had issue William, the present Noble Lord, who succeeded to the Baronies, by a Decree of the House of Lords, in 1799. His Lordship is Lieutenant Colonel of the Lanarkshire Militia, and a Baronet. BELHELVIE, in the District of Aberdeen, and Shire of Aberdeen: for merly a Rectory, belonging to the Chapter of Aberdeen; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 32 bolls of meal, 15 bolls of bear, and \u00a372.

The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 1428, and, in 1811, was 1373. It is 9 m. N. from Aberdeen. This is an extensive Parish, stretching along the German Ocean. The general appearance is unfavourable, exhibitin0- little more than heath and stones ; but notwithstanding, there are many acres of naturally very fertile land, particularly on the sea-coast. A great part ofthe Parish, under the name of The Estate of Belhelvie, formerly belonged to The Earl of Panmure, which, being forfeited in 1715, was purchased by The"], [198, "BEL York Building Company; and again sold in 1782, before the Court of Session, in sixteen different lots; since which time, a rapid improvement has taken place both upon that estate, and in other parts ofthe Parish. Fuel is expensive. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a rood ofland. BELLADRUM, v. KILLTARLATY. BELLEVILLE, v. ALVIE. BELLE-WOOD, v.

Itis in the Presbytery of Strath- Bogie, and Synod of Moray. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (including the Town of Fochabers) was 1802, and, in 1811, was 1904. It is \\\\ m. N. from Fochabers. This Parish is situate on the Eastern bank of the river Spey, and is about 6 miles in length, and nearly 4 miles in breadth. The soil is mostly loam, except upon the coast, where it is sandy ; and the whole is very fertile. The air is mild, and pure. The Duke of Gordon is sole proprietor ofthe Parish, except one farm, which belongs to The Earl of Seafield: His Grace has also an excellent Salmon fishery on the Spey. Near the confines of the Parishes of Rathven and Bellie, a neat Chapel has been built for the itinerant Minister, who has a considerable District ofthis Parish as part of his charge : he receives something from a fund collected, and accumulating, for the benefit of that mission, in addition to his Salary from the Society, and a glebe of 8 acres, together with a house. Gordon Castle, the magnificent Seat ofthe An- cient and Illustrious Family of Gordon, Duke of Gordon, Marquis of Huntley, and Earl of Norwich, is surrounded with elegant and extensive domains : This ancient residence, founded by George, second Earl of Huntley, who died in 1501, was originally called \" The windy Bog A from the very free circulation of air from the Moray Firth, and the West ; and the late Ferry-boat over the Spey"], [199, "BEN retained the name of \" The Boat of Bog .*\" This Castle was also long known all over the North, by the name of the \" The Bog of Gight,\" because of its situation in a marsh, and doubtlessly so with a view to strength, by ditches and inundation. In the Parisii of Bellie, tliere is a valuation of \u00a3242. which belongs to the Shire of Elgin; and in this little district, by some odd coincidence, a part of Gordon Castle is situate. The Duke of Cumberland forded the Spey at the Church of Bellie, in April, 1746, where the banks ofthe river are very high and steep : so that, had not the Rebels been providentially so infatuated as to neglect oppo sition, the passage must have been attended with considerable loss. About half a mile North-East from the ruins of the Kirk of Bellie, upon a high bank, over looking the low fluviated ground ofthe Spey, is the Tuessis of Richard of Ciren cester, which was intended to cover the ford of this rapid river : this Roman Station has been in form nearly a rectangular parallelogram, of 888 feet by 333 ; but, the West side, and the greatest part of the North end, of the parallelogram, are now wanting. At Upper Dalachie, near this Station, there remained invio late, until the year 1794, a sepulchral tumulus, which is popularly called The Green Cairn ; in it were discovered an Urn, and a piece of polished gold, like the handle ofa vase, three inches in diameter, and more than one-eighth of an inch thick : and, as The Society of Antiquaries at Edinburgh declined to purchase this curiosity, the finder sold it for bullion, at the price of Thirteen guineas.

This Par ish contains about 3300 acres, exclusive ofthe detached and insulated Estates of Persy on the Shee, and Cally on the Ardle ; and Drimmie on the left bank of the Eroch. It is watered by the rivers Isla, and Eroch : the former of which is sub ject to heavy floods, and over it a fine stone bridge of 5 arches was thrown by Government, in 1766, on the road from Cupar of Angus to Fort George. The soil is fertile, especially on the banks of the rivers : the more elevated dis tricts being appropriated to pasturage. It abounds with excellent free-stone, and some granite. Fuel is expensive. The principal manufacture is linen yarn. The Salary ofthe Parochial School, which is situate at Cupar Grange, is 300 merks Scotch, and perquisites. BEN-EGIN, MOUNTAIN, v. BOHARM.

It is 3 m. S.S.W. from Bervie. This Parish contains 4721 English acres; of which, nearly one-fifth part is uncultivated. The surface is much diversified, and the soil is various ; but, in many parts, it is very fertile. The air is cold and damp, but not unhealthy. The Salary of the Grammar School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites. Here are several Quarries of excel lent free-stone. The Roads are bad. Fuel is scarce. The coast abounds with fish of various kinds. Along the shore is an opening ofthe land that bears such a strong resemblance to a creek or harbour, that it often tends to mislead those who are unacquainted with the coast, which is flat and rocky. A small Village, built upon the beach, contributes to this mistake; and while it seems to promise assistance to the distressed mariner, allures him to destruction. Several vessels have suffered shipwreck by attempting to run ashore at this place ; and the utmost exertions of the inhabitants have seldom been effectual to rescue their crews from the fury of the waves. This place is called, Tlie Haughs of Nether Benholme, it lies almost in a direct line with the Church, and is nearly situate in the middle between the Fishing Towns of Gurdon, and John's-Haven. The Tower of Benholme, anciently the residence of The Earl Marischal, is still kept in repair, though not inhabited. BEN HOPE, v. TONGUE. BEN LAOGHAL, v. TONGUE. BEN LAWERS, MOUNTAIN, v. WEEM.

It is frequented by prodigious numbers of sea-fowls during the season of incubation. Here is one of the Danish Duns; and which is noticed by Dr. Macpherson, of Slate, in his Antiquities. BERNERA, v. GLENELG. BERNERAY, ISLAND, one of thc Hebrides, and inthe Shire of Inverness: it constitutes part of the Parish of Harris. This is a beautiful, and fertile Island, about 4 miles in length, and l\u00a3 mile in breadth : but its North-West side is much damaged by the breaking of sand banks. It is situate in the Sound of Harris. Divine Service is performed here only once a Quarter. BERRIED ALE, in the Shire of Caithness; and in the Parish of Latheron. It is 253\u00a3 m. N. from Edinburgh. It is situate in a romantic vale, on the banks ofthe river Berriedale, which here discharges itself into the German Ocean. According to tradition, William Sutherland was the last who possessed this Castle, which is now in ruins. He was called William More Mackehin, i. e. Big William the son of Hector, implying that he was of a gigantic size. Previous to his expedition to the Orkneys with one ofthe Earls of Caithness, where he was killed, he was prepossessed with the opinion, it is said, that he should never return to his native country. Having laid down on the ground above Berriedale"], [203, "BER Inn, contiguous to the Burying-place, he caused the length of his body to be cut out in the form of a grave, which to this day retains the name of The Long Grave, and measures about 9 feet 5 inches. Berriedale gives the title of Baron to the Noble Family of Sinclair, Earl of Caithness. On this Castle persons are sta tioned, in the salmon season, who are to observe the approach ofthe fish to the fresh waters. Here is a neat Inn, for which travellers have to thank the gen erosity of Sir John Sinclair. BERTHA, in the Shire of Perth. It is 2 m. Northward from Perth; and where, according to General Roy, there are still some faint vestiges of Old Perth. That this was a place of consequence, as being sometimes the residence of the Kings of Scotland, is certain, from the particulars which Buchanan re lates of the inundation of the Tay, which in one night's time swept the greatest part of the Town away. This happened towards the end of William's reign, who died in 1214. The King himself escaped the disaster which overwhelmed the place; but his infant son, with many of the promiscuous multitude, lost their lives. Though the existing vestiges of Bertha are extremely slight and trifling to appearance, yet even these serve to shew how, in all probability, the place was situated, on that tongue of land, before it was washed away. Here the Roman road crossed the Tay, and the houses on the opposite bank are still called Rome. From so many concurring circumstances, but especially from the distance between it and Hierna, corresponding so well with that assigned by Richard in his Itinerary, there seems to be sufficient ground to conclude, that the ancient Bertha must have been the Orrea of the Romans. General Roy has preserved a plan of it. pi. 12. BERTRAM SHOTTS, v. SHOTTS. BERUBIUM, of Ptolomy, v. DUNCANS-BAY. BERVIE, or INVER BERVIE, a Royal Borough, having separate Juris diction, locally situate in the Shire of Kincardine : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 4 chalders of victual, 400 merks of money, with \u00a350.

T2"], [204, "BER A General Post-Office is established here. It is situate at the confluence of the river Bervie with the German Ocean, which here forms a small and incon venient Harbour for Fishing boats. It was erected into a Royal Borough by a Charier from King David the Second, in 1342, as a return for the kindness and hospitality with which the inhabitants received him, when he was forced in here by stress of weather : The place on which he landed, still bears his name, and is called Craig David ; this rock is in the Parish of Kinneff, and is a conspi cuous Land-mark for mariners, being seen at the distance of 15 leagues, and is generally known by the name of Bervie Brow. James the Sixth, in the year 1595, renewed the Charter, and confirmed all the Privileges and Immunities granted by King David. By this Charter, the Public Property is distinctly marked out, and it comprehends nearly the whole extent of the Parish ; but the Property which now belongs to the Town, is confined to a piece of barren moor, a few acres of haugh ground, and a range of braes, about a mile in extent, which afford a little grass for the Cows belonging to the Inhabitants of the Town, in the summer. It is governed by a Provost, 3 Bailies, a Dean of Guild, a Trea surer, and 9 Counsellors, who are annually elected by the free Burgesses. Inver- Bervie, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of Aberdeen, Montrose, Brechin, and Aber-Brothock, sends one Member to Parliament. A fine Bridge was lately thrown over the water of Bervie; the dead arches of which have been fitted up as a Town-Hall, &c. The Revenue of the Burgh is about \u00a338. per annum. Here is a machine for spinning linen yarn, which was the first ofthe kind erected in Scotland. There is also a productive Salmon fishery, belonging to Viscount Arbuthnot, and Mr. Barclay, of Ury. Fresh water has lately been introduced into the Town, by means of pipes. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, and perquisites. Here was formerly a Religious establishment of the Order of White Friars, but nothing now remains of it. \u2014 The Parish of Bervie contains 2339 English acres. The soil on the Lower grounds, is a fine deep loam : in the Higher district, it is a mixture of clay and gravel ; and nearly one half of the Parish is under culture, according to the judicious system introduced by Mr. Barclay ; who has not only by this means increased the value of his property, but enabled the Farmer to live more comfortably and happily. Some particular Services are still retained here. The air is sharp, but not unhealthy. During storms, a considerable quantity of sea-ware is thrown ashore, which is much esteemed as a manure for raising bear or barley. BERWICK, NORTH, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction,"], [205, "BER locally situate in the Shire of Hadington : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3161., together with a glebe of 6 acres of very rich land: Patron, Sir Hew Dalrymple Hamilton, Bart. : The Church is dedicated to St. Andrew. It is in the Presbytery of Hadington, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1583, and, in 1811, was 1727. It is 22 m. N. E. b. E. from Edinburgh. The Fairs are holden on the last Thursday in June, and on the last Thursday in November. It is a General Post-Office Town. This Parish extends along the Sea-coast about three miles, from West to East, and about two miles and a half from North to South ; and contains somewhat more than 4000 acres, the whole of which is arable, with the exception of a beautiful conical eminence, called North Ber tcick Law, and about 89 acres of Links. The soil is in general rich, fertile, and well cultivated. North Berwick, and the territory around it, belonged of old to the Earls of Fife : and it continued, in this great family, till the demise of David the Second. Robert the Second granted it the privilege of a Port : and it was made a Burgh, by Robert the Third. It is one of the Royal Boroughs, which, in conjunction with Jedburgh, send one Member to Parliament. It is situate near the entrance ofthe Firth of Forth, and had formerly a considerable trade: It is under the Jurisdiction ofthe Custom-House of Preston Pans. North Berwick Law is about half a mile from the Sea: its height is rather less than 800 feet, but the country round it is so level, that it is seen from a great distance on every side: At a short distance from the Town, on the South West, are the ruins of the Cistertian Nunnery: the eminence upon which they stand, commands a delightful prospect of the Firth of Forth, the coast of Fife, and several little Islands, which lie about a mile or two from the shore ; this Monastery was founded by Malcolm, son of Duncan, Earl of Fife, soon after the year 1216; it was governed by a Prior and Prioress, and possessed a very considerable property in the Shires of Fife, and Ayr: part of the lodgings, some ofthe offices, and a gate, are remaining ; and also some very large vaults : the whole of the field, in which it stands, is filled with foundations : The site of this Monastery, with a great part of the adjacent country, is now the property of Sir Hew Dalrymple Hamilton, Bart. A picturesque little ruin stands on a small sandy mount on the shore of North Berwick, a little to the Eastward of the Harbour: various are the opinions >and reports concerning it, some making it a Chapel belonging to the adjacent Nunnery, others the Chapel of an Hospital or Hermit age ; but no proofs in support of either of those opinions are adduced from"], [206, "BER history or records : the adjacent ground appears to have been used as a Burial place, from the number of human bones scattered about it. The ancient Castle of Tamtallon stands a little more than two miles East from the town of North Berwick, on a high rock overlooking the sea, which surrounds it on three sides, its shape being half an irregular hexagon : much of the building is remaining, though in a ruinous state : it is encompassed toward the land side by a double ditch, the inner one very deep : the entrance was over a drawbridge, through a strong gate, which, with some other parts of the wall, is built with a rough stone, banded at certain distances with square stone: arising ground covers the ditches and lower parts ofthe wall, so as to render them invisible to persons approaching it : from the style of its architecture, it seems to have been of great antiquity, but the precise time, at which it was built, cannot be ascertained. It was formerly one of the strong holds of the powerful Family of Douglas. In 1455, it appears that the Barony of North Berwick, and Tamtallon Castle, had been forfeited by the Earl of Douglas. In 1479, the Lands, and Castle of Tam tallon were granted by James the Third to Archibald, the fifth Earlof Angus. In 1527, it sustained a long siege by James the Fifth, as related by Lindsay, of Pitscottie : and there is a tradition among the soldiers, that the Scots March, as now beat, was first composed for the troops going on this siege, and that it was meant to express the words **- Ding down Tamtallon.\" On the 10th of December 1540, the Lands, and Lordship of Tamtallon, with the Castle, were annexed to the Crown, by Parliament. In 1639, this Castle was destroyed by the Covenant ers, The Marquis of Douglas having favoured the cause of Charles the First. In 1640, a ratification was passed in the Parliament to Sir William Dick, of his right to the lands, and tythes, of the Barony of North Berwick. The Patronage of the Parish Church of North Berwick, with the site of the Nunnery, and the lands that belonged to it, were afterward acquired by Hew Dalrymple, who became President of the College of Justice, in 1698: and who purchased from The Marquis of Douglas, the representative of the Earls of Angus, the remainder of the Manor of North Berwick, which was now called Tamtallon, from the Castle ; and the property of the whole now belongs to his descendant. Mr. Grose has preserved four views ofthe Nunnery, and Castle, and one ofthe Ruin on the Shore. BERWICK, SHIRE. The County of Berwick, though not one ofthe largest, is, in point of fertility, one ofthe richest Counties of Scotland. It is bounded on the North by East Lothian, on the East by the German Ocean, on the South by"], [207, "BER the river Tweed and the English border, and on the West by the Counties of Roxburgh, Peebles, and Mid-Lothian. Its mean length is about 30 miles, and its breadth 17; containing about 326,400 English acres. It is nominally divided into three Districts, viz. Lauderdale, Lammer-Muir, and The Merse or March. The first is that opening or valley in the Lammer-Muir Hills, through which the river Leader flows: The Division of Lammer-Muir comprehends the ridge of hills which separate this County from East Lothian, extending from the head of Leader water to the sea, below the Town of Berwick: The Merse or March includes that fertile and populous plain, stretching from the hills, along the banks ofthe Tweed. It contains 32 Parishes, and part of a Thirty-third. Greenlaw is the County Town, where the Courts are holden; and Eyemouth is the only Port for shipping; but a great part of the produce ofthe County, chiefly grain, wool, salmon, pork and eggs, is shipped at Berwick. Its Resident Population, in 1801, was 30,621, and, in 1811, was 30,779. The direction ofthe two great English roads, lying across the East and Western extremities of the County, have greatly accelerated the progress of agriculture, and have consequently raised the value of property : in The Merse, the state of Agriculture is excellent. It sends one Member to Parliament. BERWICK, SOUTH, or BERWICK upon TWEED, a Town, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate within The Liberties of the same : a Vicarage, valued in the King's Books at \u00a320. : Patrons, The Dean and Chapter of Durham : Church dedicated to The Holy Trinity. The Resident Population of this Town, and its Liberties, in 1801, was 7187, and, in 1811, was 7746. The Money raised by the Parisii Rates, in 1803, was \u00a34044.. H.. 8^, at 3s. lid. in the Pound, on the Rack Rental. It is 53^ m. E. S. E. from Edinburgh, and 335^ m. N. b. W. from London. The Markets are on Wednesday, and Satur day. The Fairs are holden on the first Saturday in March, the second Wed nesday in May, the first Wednesday before the 26th of August, and the first Wednesday in November. It is situate on the North or Scotch side of the river Tweed, and was originally a Scotch Town of great importance, and is still a Liberty of itself, distinct from England. During the reign of Robert Bruce, in. 1318, the Town of Berwick became an important part of North Britain : that great Prince marked the consequence, which he annexed to its acquisition, by strengthening its defences and residing within its Castle : and, he seems to have supposed, by the annuities which he granted out ofthe Revenues of the Town, that his posterity would enjoy it for ever. The Setons, who were connected by"], [208, "BER marriage with Bruce, seem to have been Hereditary Governors of Berwick ; and as such enjoyed the Firms thereof. During the Border Wars, the Town and Castle were often lost, and regained. In 1482, according to Mr. Chalmers, they were finally ceded by the treasonous intrigue of The Duke of Albany, and never recovered by design or accident. The English now regarded Berwick as their own. It was made the Eastern mart of the Scottish trade by Edward the Fourth, in the Twenty-second year of his reign ; as it was by nature, the issue of the products which the Counties on the Tweed and the Teviot cou ld spare : and by this law, all merchandizes brought from Scotland were to pay customs at Berwick : the Fishery there was confirmed to the Freemen. In 1551, Berwick was made a Free Toun, independent of both England and Scotland. And, as King James the First was received with the warmest gralulations by the people of Berwick, he seems to have been equally studious to confirm to them their old Privileges. It remained a place independent of both Kingdoms, under its proper Jurisdiction, until the year 1747, when the Legislature annexed it to England. The lands belonging to it, or what are called Berwick Bounds, are about 8000 acres. It is a well built Town, pleasantly situate, on a gentle decliv ity, close by the German Ocean ; and is surrounded with high walls, regularly fortified, having a ditch on the North-East ; the river Tweed serving for a moat on the South side. It is governed by a Mayor, Recorder, one Alderman, four Bailiffs, a Town Clerk, Coroner, and other Officers. It sends two Members to Parliament ; the Mayor, and Bailiffs being the Returning officers. This was formerly the chief Town of The Merse or March, which is still generally called The Shire of Berwick : and, after it had ceased to belong to North Britain, in 1482, the Shire of Berwick had no settled County Town, when Duns was sometimes used, and Lauder often, but finally Greenlaw was confirmed as such. During the Twelfth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Centuries, the Town of Berwick, with its Suburbs, together with the adjacent Liberty or Berwick Bounds, formed two Parishes : The Town of Berwick, and the lands near the sea, on the North, forming one Parish, of which The Trinity Church was the place of Worship ; while the Village of Bondington, which no longer appears on the Maps, and the adjacent Territory, on the West, formed the other Parish, of which the Churches of St. Laurence, and The Virgin Mary, were the consecrated Houses : both those Parishes were within the Diocese of St. Andrew's, and the Deanery of The Merse : but, in Ecclesiastical affairs, it is now considered in the Deanery of Bambrough, and Diocese of Durham. The English Judges hold Assizes here."], [209, "B I G The Castle, which is now in ruins, was built by Henry the Second. It is joined to the County of Northumberland by a fine Bridge of stone, of 16 arches, which was built in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Under William The Lion, it became a place of Mintage. It does not seem ever to have possessed many ships, as the Harbour is indifferent. The Berwick Smacks, during late years, are praised for their expedition, and safety : but, the Town of Berwick, though the natural, is not now the proper Port of the Shire of Berwick ; the whole coast, from Berwick Bounds to Dunglas, being included in the Custom-House District of Dunbar, which was established, in 1710. Here are six Free-Schools. It has Barracks sufficient to accommodate two Regiments of Foot. A vast quantity of corn, wool, and eggs, are annually exported, together with abundance of fine Sal mon, both fresh and pickled. The Salmon fisheries lie on each side ofthe river Tweed, and are all private property, except those belonging to The Dean and Chapter of Durham, which, in rent and tythe offish, bring in upwards of \u00a3450. per annum, for all the other fisheries are liable to tythe. The chief import is timber from Norway and the Baltic. The Scottish Lyrists have delighted to speak, in encomiastic strains, ofthe Tweed. It was Thomson's \" parent stream, whose pastoral banks first heard his Doric reed.\" Hamilton, of Bangour, also cele brates \" the flow'r-blushing bank of the Tweed.\" \"Bonny Ticeedside ,\" is the frequent topic of Ramsay's muse. And it is questioned by Mr. Ritson, whether any English writer has produced such a beautiful Pastoral, as Crawford's Tweedside. BETHELNY, v. MELDRUM. BEWLIE-HILL, and BEWLIE MOSS, v. LILLIES-LEAF. BHEIN-GHULBHUIN, p. GLEN SHEE BIEL, in the Shire of Hadington ; and in the Parish of Stenton. It is 3 m. S. W. from Dunbar. This Estate belongs to William Hamilton Nisbet, Esq., who is making very extensive improvements here. BIELMOUTH, in the Shire of Hadington ; and in the Parisii of Dunbar. Here the river Biel, aster flowing by Whittingham, the Bield, Belton, and West Barns, empties itself into the German Ocean. BIGGA, ISLE, one of the Shetland Isles. Half of this Isle belongs to the Parish of Delting, and half to theParish of Yell, It is situate in Yell Sound, and is inhabited by four Families. BIGGAR, in the Upper Ward, and Shire of Lanark : formerly a Collegiate Church, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 3 chalders of oat-meal,. one chalder vol. i. U"], [210, "B I G of barley, \u00a355.. 11.. 11^ in money, and \u00a32..10..0. as an allowance for grass : the manse is in good repair: the glebe consists of 2f acres: Patron, Lord Elphin stone : The Church, which is an ancient Gothic building, is in decent condition. It is in the Presbytery of Biggar, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population ofthis Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 1216, and, in 1811, was 1376. It is 27| m. S. b. W. from Edinburgh. The Market is well sup plied. The Fairs are holden on the second Tuesday, O. S., in June, the first Thursday, O. S., in July, the last Thursday, O. S.,in October. A General Post- Office is established here. It is situate on a dry and elevated hill, with a South erly exposure, and is a healthy and well aired Town. Bog Hall stands upon a flat, or rather a marshy ground, half a mile South from the town, and is probably so called from its situation. This Castle formerly belonged to the Flemings, Earls of Wigton, a family of great antiquity : they acquired the lands and Barony of Biggar by the marriage of Sir Patrick Fleming, with one of the daughters and Co-heiresses of the brave Sir Simon Fraser, of Oliver Castle. This Sir Patrick was the second son of Sir Robert Fleming, who died in the year 1314; and, like him, was a faithful friend to King Robert Bruce. In 1451, Sir Robert de Fleming obtained a Charter from King James the Second, erecting the Town of Biggar into a free Burgh of Barony, and by the same was created a Lord of Parliament, by the title of Lord Fleming, of Cumbernaud : and, on the 15th of June 1452, Malcolm Fleming, his nephew, procured a grant under the Great Seal, of the Lands and Barony of Bog Hall, and some other estates. The Mansion of Bog Hall continued in the Family of the Flem ings, and was occasionally their residence until the year 1747 ; when Charles, Earl of Wigton, dying unmarried, his sister, Lady Clementina, marrying Charles, afterwards Lord Elphinstone, carried it, together with the Barony, into that family ; in which it at present remains. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. The Collegiate Church of Biggar was founded in the year 1545 by Malcolm Lord Fleming, Lord High Chamberlain of Scotland, and Ancestor to the Earls of Wigton : it was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and endowed for a Provost, 8 Prebendaries, 4 Singing-boys, and 6 Poor men. It is a hand some building ; and, from its general appearance, seems much older than the time of the Foundation here mentioned : possibly it might have been then stand ing as a Parochial Church, and raised by the Flemings to the dignity of a College. Here is the Cemetery of The Earls of Wigton ; and here also is pre served an ancient Vase, supposed to be Roman : in the days of Popery it was"], [211, "B I N appropriated to sacred offices, as it still continues to be; for it is now used to contain the water for Baptism. The iron collar, Called The Jongs, an instrument for Ecclesiastical punishments, is still hanging by a chain in the wall, near the door ofthe Church. Mr. Grose has preserved a view ofthis Collegiate edifice. The Parish of Biggar is about 6 miles in length, and 3^ miles in breadth; the surface is partly hilly, and partly level ; and is almost equally divided between tillage, and pasture. The public Roads are in good repair; and the Bridge lately built across the Clyde, a little way to the West of the town, is a great accom modation to the public. Fuel is expensive. Here are the vestiges of a Roman Station, called The Moat, and where Roman coins have been discovered. Tra dition reports a severe and bloody engagement to have taken place in this neigh bourhood, between the Scots under the command of Sir William Wallace, and the English army: and, at the West end ofthe Town, is a larg tumulus, which appears never to have been opened ; and it is hoped, will not be disturbed. BIGHOUSE BAY, v. REAY. BIGSWELL, v. FIRTH. BIMERSYDE-HILL, v. MERTOWN BINGHILL, v. PETER CULTER. BIN HILL, v. RATHVEN. BINNING, in the Shire of Linlithgow: an ancient Parish, annexed after the Reformation to the Parish of Linlithgow. Thomas Hamilton, who, being bred to the Law, was by King James the Sixth made one ofthe Senators in the Col lege of Justice, Secretary of State, and Lord Advocate and Register; and, in 1613, he was created Baron Binning, and Earl of Melros, which he afterwards changed to the title of Hadington: In 1627, he was constituted Lord Privy Seal, which office he held for ten years. BINNOCH, or BINNING, v. LINLITHGOW. BINNS, in the Shire of Linlithgow ; and in the Parish of Abercorn. This was the Birth-place of Thomas Dalyell, or Dalziel, whose name occurs in the Register of Baptisms for Abercorn, in 1615. He was Commander in Chief of the Forces in Scotland, distinguished by great fidelity to his King, and is recorded to have had many peculiarities of character. He died on the 22d of August 1685. Mr. Granger, in his Supplement, p. 502, has preserved a spirited anec dote of him. BINNY CRAIG, v. LINLITHGOW. BINNY, EAST and WEST, v. ECCLES MACHAN. U2"], [212, "B I R BINRA, MOUNTAIN, v.

It is in the Presbytery of Elgin, and Synod of Moray. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 366, and, in 1811, was 359. It is 3 m. S. from Elgin. This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth. The general appearance is bleak, and rugged, the greatest part being covered with heath and moss: the arable land, for the most part, is sandy, shallow, stony, and steep, lying either on a bed of rock or of compacted gravel : some fields contiguous to the Lossie, consist of loam either upon a bed of clay or sand: and several plots, ofa mossy and moory nature, are to be found both among the high and low lands. It is intersected with the three rivulets Lennock, Barden, and Rushcrook, whieh flow into the river Lossie. The air is pure along the banks of the Lossie, but rather moist among the hills; itis, however, equally healthful in each of these places. It abounds with game. Considerable improvements in agriculture have been made here, by the encouragement of the late Earl of Findlater and Seafield, who was then the only Heritor : but Dr. Stephen has now a property here. Peats are abundant, and good BIRRENS, or BURRENS, v. MIDDLEBIE. BIRRENSWORK HILL, in the Shire of Dumfries; and in the Parish of Hoddom. It is situate between the rivers Mein and Milk, near the village'of Eccles-Fechan, on the East side ofthe Roman way leading from the Station at Middlebie along Annandale. The extent and figure of this remarkable Hill, which not only commands a prospect over the Shire of Dumfries, and also into East Galloway, but likewise over all Cumberland, and even into Westmoreland, will be best understood by a reference to General Roy's plan and sections of it, pi. 16. On the South skirt of the hill, there is an oblong Camp, 300 yards in"], [213, "B I R length by 200 in breadth : and on the North side another, of half the extent of the first, that is to say, 300 yards long, and 100 broad. From the different style of intrenchment, and disagreement in size between the Birrenswork Camps and those at Torwood Moor and Cleghorn, on the same Western Com munication, there seems sufficient reason to suppose, that these works were thrown up at some other period of time, and by some other Roman General than Agricola. BIRSA, in the Island of Pomona, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shetland: formerly a Vicarage, united to the ancient Vicarage of Harra ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, including the glebe, was upwards of \u00a3150. : the manse was built in 1761, and is in bad repair : Patron, Lord Dundas : The Church is in bad condition. It is in the Presbytery of Cairston, and Synod of Orkney. The Resi dent Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 1451, and, in 1811, was 1432. The United Parishes of Birsa and Harra, the former of which is situate on the shores of the Atlantic, of a dry rich soil, and indifferently cultivated ; the latter more inland, more wet, and less productive, were anciently known by the name of Birgis-Harad, i. e. Birgis or Birsa, hunting, and Harad, now Harra, a territory: and, if this derivation be just, the conclusion will naturally be, that these Parishes of old composed a District destined principally, if not solely, to the amusement of Hunting. This is by no means improbable ; for, before Kirkwall was a place of any great note, the Princes, perhaps, and certainly the Counts, and even the Bishops, had their chief residence in Birsa ; and it is almost needless to observe, that in a barbarous age, when war is the business of men of rank and fortune, hunting very seldom fails to be their favourite amusement. Neither are the nature, the form, nor the dimensions of these Parishes ill adapted to that purpose. Their Western extremity is a flat, fertile, and rather narrow tract ofland, which opens gradually towards the East, till it swells at length to an immense Amphi theatre, bounded by the hills of Sandwick, Orphir, and Rendal. Game was also perhaps found there in abundance. Besides what they at present contain, there were formerly, it is evident, some other kinds, such as hares, and several sorts of red and fallow deer, the horns of which have been often dug up in various parts hereabouts. To this it may be added, that several beautiful Lakes, of different sizes, are dispersed through this district, with some pretty large rivu lets intersecting it in various directions ; and, as the former of these contain plenty of swans, ducks, and other water-fowl, so both of them abound in those kinds of fish that generally frequent fresh water ; all of which might have con-"], [214, "B I R tribuled to vary, as well as to enlarge the sphere of their amusement. These Parishes discover at present much difference of soil, some pretty deep, some thin or shallow, some, especially in Birsa, dry and sandy ; whereas in Harra, it is mostly of a deep clay, sometimes intermixed with ground that is wet and swampy. Though, in several parts of them, marl of an excellent kind might be had with little expense or labour, the Inhabitants have hitherto made very little use of it as manure, but satisfied themselves with a scanty portion of compost of dung and earth, to raise alternately bear and oats ; when they might have added to their stores, not only some other kind of grain, and all ofa superior quality, but also flax and hemp in great perfection. For want of an accurate survey, the proportion between the land in tillage, and what is entirely uncultivated, cannot be precisely determined ; but the whole is believed to amount to fity-eight square miles, including the Lochs already mentioned, some of which it would not be difficult to drain, and thus add much valuable land to the Parishes. The Inhabitants are employed on their little farms in spring and harvest ; in summer they burn about twenty tons of kelp at an average ; and, filling up the intervals with catching the ordinary kinds offish for their own consumption, they support themselves without aid from others. Some monuments of antiquity may still be seen here, among which must be reckoned the ruins of that magnificent Palace, reared by the ancient Earls, and situate on a beautiful green spot, near the Church on the sea-side, fronting what is called The Burgh of Birsa. This last is a small portion of pretty high land, which the force of the Ocean has separated from the Mainland, and formed into a distinct Island ; to which there is access by land only at low water. From the remains of a Wall yet to be seen on the land-side, and the marks of some huts within it, there is much reason to believe that, as the name Burgh imports, it was, like some others in the Islands, a rock fortification. In a later period, it served a very different purpose, as there are in it the remains ofa Chapel, said to have been dedicated to St. Peter, which, like its fellow chapel in the Burgh of Deer-Ness, was until lately a place of Pilgrimage, and the receptacle of many devout oblations : but Time, operating with other circumstances, has now destroyed the credit of their virtues. Picts' Houses are very frequent. And single erect monumental Stones are not uncommon : of which, one gives the name of Stone-garth to a piece of excellent land that lies around it ; two, known by the name of Stanerandy, stand on a tumulus or barrow, without the walls of the Barony ; and three, of a much smaller size, amidst a number of very large tumuli, concerning which even"], [215, "B I R tradition ventures not to give any opinion. The names of many of the places here [are evidently of Norwegian extraction ; and, in Harra, on account of its distance from the sea, and, of consequence, little intercourse with strangers, the Norse language was spoken both in greater purity, and to a later period, than in any ofthe other Islands. Marble, and alabaster, are said to have been discovered both at Buquoy, and Swanay, in the Parish of Birsa. Above the Gate of the Palace was the famous Inscription, which, among other points of ditty, cost Earl Patrick his head: viz., \" Dominus Robertus Stuartus films Jacobi quinti Rex Scotorum, hoc opus instruxit\" and above his coat of arms was the following motto, \" Sic suit, est, et eritA this stone, it is thought, is now in the possession of The Earl of Morton, to whom the lands were sold, and by him re-sold to the late Sir Lawrence Dundas, in whose son's possession (Thomas, Lord Dundas) the largest estate in the Parish still continues. Here is a Parochial School, with a salary of 900 merks Scotch, together with the Session Clerkship, and some perquisites that are generally paid in kind. Two Charity schools have also been established here, by a mortification left by Nicol Spence, late Church Agent, which is the rent of his Houses in Edinburgh, lying in Warriston s Close. BIRSE, or PRESS, i. e. The Wood or Thicket, in the District of Kincardine O'Neil, and Shire of Aberdeen: formerly a Rectory, belonging to the Chancellor of Aberdeen; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3135..18..11-f- Sterling, includ ing \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements, 3 bolls 3 firlots and -f of alippie of meal, 1 firlot 2 pecks 1 lippie of bear, County measure, and \u00a318. .8.. 1. by Parliamentary augmentation : the manse is commodious, and in good repair: the glebe is scarcely legal ; but part of it, particularly the garden, is valuable : Patron, The Crown : The Church was re-built, in 1779, in a superior style. It is in the Presbytery of Kincardine O'Neil, and Shire of Aberdeen. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 1266, and, in 1811, was 1299. It is 3\u00a3 m. S.W. from Kincardine O'Neil. This Parish, comprehending the three vallies or straths of Feugh-Side, Tlie Six Towns, and The Water of Chattie, forms nearly a square of 10 miles. The surface is uneven, and in some places even rocky and moun tainous; and is beautifully diversified with hill and dale, wood and water. The arable soil is in general light and sharp, and of the whole extent not more than 2500 acres are under cultivation; the remainder being hill and moss, or covered with that extensive Forest of natural wood, called The Forest of Birse. Game, of all kinds, are in great abundance. It is watered by the Avon, the Feugh, and the burns of Chattie, and Birse, all of which are tributary streams to the Deey"], [216, "B L A and abound with fish. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, a dwelling, and a rood of land. Besides which, there is a Free School, in good repute, with a mortification of \u00a3500. by the late Dr. Gilbert Ramsay, a School-house, and a glebe of about 6 acres. Here are inexhaustible quarries of excellent lime-stone, and granite. Peats, and turf, are in plenty, though not of easy access. The public roads are in tolerable repair : but a bridge is much wanted at Pot-arch, over the Dee, near Inchbair. The House of Finzean, the residence of Mr. Farquharson, and the House of Ballogie, the residence of Mr. Innes, are surrounded with extensive Plantations, and their worthy Proprietors are making every patriotic and laudable exertion in the improvement of their estates. At Easter Clune, are the small remains ofa square Tower, which is said to have been built by the Archbishop of Ross, who was proprietor of the place, and a native of Birse. The late Dr. Gilbert Ramsay, Rector of Christ's Church, in the Island of Barbadoes, was also a native ofthis Parish ; whose piety and benevolence are so conspicuous from his liberal benefactions to this Village, but especially feo Marischal College. From the late Donald Rose, of Wester Clune, the present Right Honourable George Rose, Treasurer of the Navy, is lineally descended. BIRSLEY, in the Shire of Hadington ; and the Parisii of Tranent.

This is the residence of The Bishop of Sodor and Man *. it was formerly a venerable edifice, but was demolished, and a modern building erected on its site ; which is inferior in external magnificence to the ancient Palace, but more adapted to the refinement and luxury of modern times. His Lordship's domain contains between three and four hundred acres. The grounds are well wooded, and, besides a sea view, command the luxuriant prospect of the Northern district. BISHOP'S FOREST, v. KIRK-PATRICK IRONGRAY. BISHOPS-HILL, v. SCOTLAND'S-WELL. BLACKADER, v. EDROM. BLACKATER MOUNT, in the Shire of Berwick : and in the Parish of Lamberton. Here James Small carried on his extensive manufactory of all sorts of implements used in agriculture, but especially ploughs, which, from the high estimation in which they were so justly holden, were generally known by the"], [217, "B L A name of Small's Ploughs. This ingenious Mechanic, a native of Scotland, returned from England to Berwickshire about the year 1764, where very little was then known of the construction of wheel carriages, and still less of the mechanical principles of the Plough ; a good plough or cart being obliged to be brought from Northumberland, many miles distant. John Renton, Esq., of Lamberton, a zealous promoter of the agriculture of this county, saw at once this man to be the only individual wanted fully to accomplish all their designs. Mr. Renton, therefore, immediately settled him here, erected all the necessary buildings for a Smith and Carpenter's manufactory ; set him agoing with cash, and gave him credit ; and hence issued numbers of ploughs, carts, waggons, large and small, and all the different implements of husbandry in abundance. Thus he went on for many years : \u2014 Happy for this ingenious Artist, if in the future career of life, he had finished upon the same plan on which he set out ! BLACKBURN, v. CASTLE-TOWN. BLACKBURN, in the Shire of Linlithgow ; and in the Parish of Livingston. It is 4 m. S. W. from Mid Calder. The Market is well supplied. George Moncrieff, Esq., is the principal Heritor, and is resident. Here is an extensive Cotton manufactory. There is also a Coal mine ; and a Paper Mill, and two Lime-kilns, have recently been erected. It is situate near the river Amon. See, Livingston. BLACKCHESTER, v. BOWDEN BLACKERSTONE, v.

The Fair is holden on the 7th of October. This Parish is of a circular figure, having a diameter of nearly six miles, and com prising a ridge of the Ochil Hills, which affords excellent pasture for sheep : the lower grounds are watered by the Allan, but the soil is by no means good. The climate is cold, damp, and inclement. In the lands of Abercairney, belonging to Charles Murray, Esq., is a large Quarry, which has for many years furnished the adjacent country with excellent Mill-stones. Peats, and turf, are in great plenty: but a considerable quantity of pit-coal is annually imported vol. i. X"], [218, "B L A The roads, and bridges, arc in good repair. There were formerly several Chapels in this Parish, some of which are still standing : and, before the year 1745, Divine Service was occasionally performed in the one situate at the house of Gleneagles, which is the burial place of the Family of Haldane ; and in another, near the Castle of Tullibardine , in the choir of which The Dukes of Athol formerly interred: besides these, there are the vestiges of two chapels in the ground of Mahany, belonging to Colonel Drummond, at one of which is a burying-ground still in use by the inhabitants of the neighbourhood. Upon an eminence, fronting Gleneagles, are the vestiges of a small Roman camp. There are also several Druidical circles. In this Parish, the ancestors of The Duke of Montrose had their ordinary residence, at the Castle of Kincardine, which was burned in the time of the Civil Wars, and has never been re-built. In Tullibardine, stand the remains of a Castle of that name, the seat, in former times, of The Earls of Tullibardine : and, for a long time after that family came to the titles of Athol, by marrying the Heiress, they resided there some part of the year : at the Rebellion in 1715, it was garrisoned by a party of the Earl of Marr's army, and taken by The Duke of Argyle: before the year 1745, Lord Georgb Murray and his family inhabited it ; but since that time, it has been suffered to go to ruin. Tullibardine gives the title of Marquis to the Ancient and Illustrious family of Murray, Duke of Athol. The Village of Blackford was burned by a cruel command of the Pretender, in the month of January 1716. Duchaly is the hospitable Mansion of David Drummond, Esq. BLACKHALL, v. STRACHAN.

BLAIR- ATHOL, or BLAIR in ATHOL, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Rectory, with the ancient Parish of Strowan united ; and which consisted for merly of the Parishes of Blair- Athol, Strowan, Lude, and Killmaveonog; the Stipend, in 1811, being \u00a3150..0..0. in money: the manse is in decent repair *. the glebes contain more than the legal extent: Patron, The Duke of Athol: The Church is in good condition. It is in the Presbytery of Dunkeld, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of the United Parishes, in 1801. was 2848, and, in 1811, was 2515. It is 20 m. NW. b. N. from Dunkeld. The Fair is holden on the 1st of February. These Parishes are supposed to contain 130,000 Scotch acres ; of which, about 4000 acres only are under tillage. In so X2"], [220, "B L A large a tract of country, the appearance, surface, and soil, are exceedingly vari ous: but the surrounding valley is richly cultivated. The climate is cold, and rainy, but not unhealthy. In the extensive Forest of Athol, and on many ofthe moors, game, of various kinds, are abundant. The Duke of Athol is Superior, and Proprietor of at least one half ofthis District. The Gaelic is the prevailing language here. The Salary of the Parochial School at Blair, is \u00a310. which is paid by the Heritors, and 100 merks Scotch paid out ofthe Bishop's rents, toge ther with School-fees, and perquisites. Tliere are also three Charity Schools ; to one of which The Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge pay \u00a310., to another \u00a37., and to the third \u00a34. per annum. The District of Athol gives the title of Duke to The Ancient and Illustrious Family of Murray, so created in 1703. Athol-House, according to Mr. Pennant, is seated on an eminence above a plain, which is watered by the Garrie; a most outrageous stream, whose ravages have greatly deformed the valley by the vast beds of gravel that it has left behind. This House, or Castle, is of uncertain antiquity: the oldest part is called Comyns Tower, being supposed to have been built by John, com monly called de Strathbogie, who enjoyed the title of Athol, in right of his wife. It became the principal seat of his successors. In 1644, The Marquis of Mont rose possessed himself of it, and was joined by a large body of the Athol Highlanders, to whose bravery he was indebted for the victory at Tibber-muir. In the troubles of 1653, this place was taken by storm by Colonel Daniel, an Officer of Cromwel's party, who, unable to remove a magazine of provision lodged there, destroyed it by gun-powder. In 1689, it occasioned one of the greatest events ofthe time, being the cause that brought on the celebrated battle of Killicrankie. An officer belonging to Viscount Dundee flung himself into it, and refusing to deliver it to Lord Murray, son to The Marquis of Athol, was by him threatened with a siege: His Lordship, to effect the reduction, assembled a body of forces, and marched towards the place : Lord Dundee, a zealous par tisan of the Abdicating Monarch, knew the importance of preserving this Pass, and the communications with the Highland Clans, in whom he had the greatest confidence: With his usual expedition, he joined the garrison ; and, in a few days after, concluded his glorious life with the well-known defeat of the Royal forces under General Mackay. The last siege which it experienced, was in 1746, when it was gallantly defended by Sir Andrew Agnew against the Rebels, who retired from before it a few weeks preceding the battle of Culloden. As soon as Peace was established, a considerable part ofthis Fortress was reduced in height,"], [221, "B L A and the inside most magnificently furnished ; and it is now the splendid resi dence of The Duke of Athol. BLAIR CASTLE, in the Shire of Perth, though locally situate in the Shire of Fife; and in the Parish of Culross.

KINCARDINE. BLAIR-GO WRIE, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 5 chalders of victual, two-thirds payable in meal, and one-third in bear, together with \u00a345. Sterling in money, and \u00a38..6..8. for Com munion elements : the manse, and offices, are in good repair : the glebe consists of 9| acres, of which, 4~ are good land, the remaining 5, lately obtained in lieu of grass ground, being of an inferior quality, and at a considerable distance from the manse : Patrons, Colonel Allan Macpherson, of Blair- Gowrie, and Colonel William Lindsay, of Spynie, in consequence of his marriage with one of the Co-heiresses of Ardblair : The Church was built in 1767, and is a plain, sub stantial edifice, but cold in winter. It is in the Presbytery of Meigle, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1914, and, in 1811, was 1965. It is 58. m. N. b. W. from Edinburgh. It is pleasantly situate upon the banks of the river Ericht, and was made a Burgh of Barony, by a Charter from Charles the First, in 1634 : the whole of it belongs in Superiority to Colonel Allan Macpherson, who is Proprietor of about one fourth part ofthe Parish. This Village is well supplied with butcher's meat, and other articles. The Fairs are holden on the third Wednesday in March, the 23d of July, the second Wednesday in August, and the first Wednesday in November. A General Post-Office is established here ; and also a Stamp- Office for stamping linens, of which considerable quantities are manufactured in this neighbourhood. This Parish is about 11 miles in length, and 8 miles in breadth ; being divided into two districts by a branch ofthe Grampian moun tains, which is the Northern boundary of this part of the beautiful valley of Strathmore. The hills are mostly covered with heath ; but, along the banks of the Isla, and the Ericht, the soil is a deep rich loam, though subject to the sudden inundations of those rivers. The climate is healthy. Tliere are several Lakes, abounding with pike, and perch : and some that have been drained, now furnish great quantities of excellent marl. Fuel is expensive. Curling is an exer cise, at which the inhabitants of this district excel. The rate of multure paid at"], [222, "B L A the Mills, is about one-twelfth part. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees. The Public Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. Newton House, which commands an extensive view, not only of Strathmore, but also of part of several Counties, was the birth-place of the justly celebrated George Drummond, Esq., six times elected Lord Provost of the City of Edinburgh. About half a mile farther West, lies the Mansion-house ofthe old family of the Blairs, of Ardblair, who were long the Proprietors of a most extensive property in this Parish, and are still possessed of a fifth part of it. Here are several large cairns, and Druidical circles. BLAIRINGONE, i. e. The Field of Spears, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Fossaway. It is 10 m. N. W. from Dunfermlin. This is a Burgh of Barony, under the Superiority of The Duke of Athol. A Market is holden here in the month of June. Here are coal pits, belonging to the Duke ; and also a private School, for the benefit of the children belonging to the work people ofthe Colliery ; but the salary is very small, and quite inadequate to the services of a proper master. It probably derives its name, from Weapon- Shawings having been made here, and from exercising the people inthe use ofthe Spear, near the Seat of the Chief ; for the Chieftain of the Murrays had a family seat at this place : And The Rocky Pinnacle, now vulgarly called Gibson's Craig, is said to be the real Gartwhinzian, where the whole Clan of the Murrays assembled to attend their Chief. On the North-West side of the Southern branch of the Parish of Fossaway, the site of the Family seat of the old Earls of Tullibardine is still visible, and goes by the name of The Palace-Brae. BLANE-FIELD, in the District of Carrick, and Shire of Ayr : in the Parish of Kirk-Oswald. This is the estate ofthe respectable Family of Bl ane. The late Mr. Gilbert Blane set the exaniple of making inclosures here, and was also the first person in the Parish who introduced the improvement of land by lime. On the 3d of November 1812, Gilbert Blane, M. D., one of the Physi cians in Ordinary to His Royal Highness The Prince Regent, had the-honour to be created a Baronet.

W. from Hamilton. This Parish is about 6 miles in length, and one mile in breadth. The surface declines from South to North, where it is bounded by the Clyde, upon the banks of which are very large Cotton Mills. The soil is exceedingly fertile, except towards the Southern extremity, where it degenerates into a deep peat-moss. Itis watered by the rivers Calder, and Clyde : and, upon the banks ofthe former, a vast quantity of iron-stone, of excellent quality, has lately been discovered, which is now worked to great advantage. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and a house, and garden. The banks ofthe Calder, and Clyde are here very picturesque, and are ornamented with a number of beautiful family Mansions, especially Green-Hall, Mill-Heugh, Calder-Bank, Blantyre Farm, and Coat's-Hill. A considerable part of the ancient Priory of the Canons Regular, founded before the year 1296, is still standing upon a rock which rises almost perpendicularly out of the Clyde : in 1606, it was erected into a Tem poral Lordship in favour of Walter Stewart, Keeper of the Privy Seal, ofthe family of Galloway, from whom the present Noble owner, Robert Lord Blantyre, is descended : and the whole ofthe Heritors, who are numerous, pay feu-duty to His Lordship, who is also Titular ofthe Teinds.

The soil is in some parts sandy ; but, in general, it is a stiff, rich, deep clay, on a bed of limestone, and is tolerably fertile. The air is moist, but healthy. The rivers Fiddich, and Spey, flow through an exten sive Valley, that is surrounded with lofty mountains, of which, that of Ben-Egin"], [225, "BOL is the most remarkable. This Parish is possessed by four Heritors ; \u2014 David Mac Dowall Grant, Esq., has the lands of Airndilly, Papeen, Newtown, Gali val, and Auchmadies ; \u2014 The Earl of Seafield holds the Barony of Mulben, and the lands of Cairnty and Muldeiry ; \u2014 Andrew Stuart, Esq., Writer to the Signet, has the Barony of Auchl uncart ; \u2014 and Archibald Duff, Esq., of Drum muir, has the farm of Knocan. The Scottish is the only language spoken in the Parish. The Castle of Galival, which was probably built by the Freskyns, of Duffus, is now an extensive ruin : and about 50 yards from the North end of it, tliere formerly stood a Chapel within its own consecrated burying-ground, and which is supposed to have been the parent of the present Parish Church. A part ofthe Parish of Dundurcos has also of late been united to Boharm, and a new Church erected about two miles Eastward, in a situation more central James Ferguson, the celebrated Astronomer, received the Rudiments of his education here. The Hospital of St. Nicholas is completely demolished. The Commis sioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, in their Fifth Report of April, 1811, observe, \" an application has been made to us, representing the utility which might be expected to result from building a bridge over the river Spey, in the Parish of Boharm, at a Ferry, now called \" Boat of Bridge,\" from the appearances of an ancient Bridge, still remaining there. Perceiving that the Memorialists were little aware of the expense of constructing a Bridge across such a river as the Spey, We postponed any positive answer till a due examina tion of the spot had taken place, and We now learn from a plan and report recently laid before us, that the proposed situation of this Bridge is within six miles of Fochabers, and almost in sight ofthe New Bridge at that place ; to wards which, Parliament granted \u00a36000. in the year 1805. Under these circum stances, We cannot think ourselves warranted in affording public aid to the pro posed bridge at Boharm, even if the contributors should persevere in their applica tion, aster knowing the amount ofthe estimate : but We are sufficiently convinced of the utility of additional communication across the Spey, to induce us to lend ready assistance in case any proposal shall be made for the improvement of the present Ferry at Boharm, and ofthe roads of approach to it.\" BOISACK, in the Shire of Forfar ; and in the Parish of Kinnel.

Archibald Fraser, of Lovat : The Church, and Manse, are large and commodious, but from their exposed situa- tion, are liable to frequent repairs. It is in the Presbytery of Aber-Tarf, and Synod of Glen-Elg. The Resident Population ofthe United Parishes, in 1801, was 1748, and, in 1811, was 1462. It is 12^ m. N.E. from Fort Augustus. The United Parish is 24 miles in length, and from 10 to 12 miles in breadth : the surface is various ; that part situate at the Western extremity of Loch Ness, is level ; but the Eastern District is mountainous ; the soil also varies from the finest clay or light loam, to the worst gravel or deep flow moss. It abounds with lime-stone, and several Quarries are now worked. Foyers is the Scat of the Frasers, the Chief ofthe ancient and powerful Clan of that name ; near which is The Fall of Foyers, a remarkable cascade, ofthe waters of Loin into Loch Ness. \" Towards evening,\" says Dr. Johnson, \"we crossed by a bridge, the river which makes the celebrated Fall of Foyers. The country at the bridge strikes the imagination with all, the gloom and grandeur of Siberian solitude. The way makes a flexure, and the mountains, covered with trees, rise at once on the left hand and in the front. We desired our guides to shew us The Fall, and dismounting, clambered over very rugged crags, till I began to wish that our curiosity might have been gratified with less trouble and danger. We came at last to a place where we could overlook the river, and saw a channel torn, as it seems, through black piles of stone, by which the stream is obstructed and broken, till it comes to a very steep descent, of such dreadful depth, that we were naturally inclined to turn aside our eyes.\" On the summit of the hill of Dunardile, are the remains of a vitrified Fort.

This Parish contains about 2300 acres, mostly inclosed: and of which, about 170 acres are planted: the surface is level, with the exception ofa gentle eminence about the middle of the Parish, and the soil is fertile. The Tenants are sometimes subjected to kain and carriage of coals, and thirlage to mills ; many pay money for grinding, or barley making; and even in some places, thirlage is converted into money. The fuel used here is chiefly coal. The Schoolmaster's Salary is 300 merks, and perquisites. In the village are some vestiges of an ancient House, and a Park on the West side of it, still called The Orchard, being about four acres, which is said to have belonged to John Hep- burn; and who, according to Mr. Chalmers, was executed, in January 1568, as the associate of The Earl of Bothwell, his Chief, in the murder of Darnley. The Manor of Bolton, thus forfeited, was given to William Maitland, the well- known SecretaryLETHiNGTON, the author of the plot, which ended in the death of Darnley. It was confirmed to the Earl of Lauderdale, in 1621. The fa- mous Duke of Lauderdale, while he acted with the insurgent Covenanters, appears to have annexed the Patronage of the Church of Bolton to the Manor. Richard Earl of Lauderdale, who died about the year 1693, sold the Barony of Bolton, with the Patronage ofthe Church, and even the ancient inheritance of Lethington, to Sir Thomas Levingston ; and Sir Thomas transferred the whole to Walter Lord Blantyre, in whose Family the property remains. There are three Parks belonging to Lethington in this Parish, on the South West side of the river; two of which are yearly let for pasture; the third was made an Orchard, by the late Lord Blantyre, with a small pleasure ground planted by the side ofthe water: the other Parks of Lethington are in the Parish of Had ington, in all between three and four hundred acres: the walls of which Thc Duke of Lauderdale is said to have heightened to about 12 feet, when The Y2"], [228, "BON Duke of York came to Scotland in the reign of Charles the Second, that he might show a Deer-park in Scotland, which His Royal Highness had been in formed did not then anywhere exist: the walls have been reduced by Lord Blantyre to seven feet.

On the East side ofthe river Ness, about five or six Hundred yards below its efflux from Loch Ness, there are the remains of a Roman Station; which, it is supposed, was the site of the Banatia Urbs, of Richard of Cirencester. BON AR, in the Shire of Sutherland: and in the Parisii of Criech. It is 12 m. W. from Dornoch. By the Fifth Report of The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, in April 1811, it appears, that all the investi gations of Highland lines of road North from Inverness, have uniformly de signated the head ofthe Dornoch Firth as a necessary central point ; and to the inhabitants ofthe Eastern part of Sutherland, and of all Caithness, it is import ant that the passage should be established as near to the Coast as can be made safe and practicable. The inconvenience and danger experienced at The Meikle Ferry, at the mouth ofthe Dornoch Firth ; and the circuitous rout by Portinlech, a Ferry at the head of that Firth, rendered it very desirable to ascertain and de termine upon the most convenient place for crossing it between these extreme points. For this purpose, Criech and Bonar appeared to possess nearly equal pretensions, the first being wider but nearer the coast; the other, narrower, but not affording so direct a road towards the North-East. While the question was, which of two Ferries should be preferred, that of Criech seemed to have the pre ference, insomuch that the Surveys of the Skibo road, and ofthe Dornoch road, were made to terminate at that spot; and no pains were spared to ascertain the species of Ferry boat best adapted to the place ; but the degree of accommoda tion afforded by a Ferry and a Bridge is so different, that much hesitation was fell by all parties before the Bridge over the Dornoch Firth, mentioned in the Sutherland County Assessment Act, should be thus finally relinquished. In this dilemma, Mr. Telford felt himself justified by the measurements which had"], [229, "BON been taken at Bonar Ferry, to propose an Iron Bridge at that place, whereby not only the Ferry of Criech, and any Bridge at Portinlech, but also a less con siderable bridge over the river Carran, on the road towards Portinlech, would be rendered unnecessary. In his Report to The Commissioners, dated the 3d of January 1811, Mr. Telford observes, \" Having repeatedly examined this Firth, I find that about 12 miles above Dornoch at Bonar Ferry, it is con tracted into the breadth of about 70 yards at low water of a Spring tide ; at which time, 20 yards of that breadth extending from the Southern shore, is covered by water no more than three feet in depth; and, as the Springtides rise no more than eight feet, I conceive it is practicable to construct a bridge at this place where the several roads, South and North of it, may be made to centre without inconvenience. As considerable quantities of ice float here in Winter, and the tides run with considerable velocity, it is adviseable to construct an Iron Bridge of one arch 150 feet span, and 20 feet rise; and by making the arch to spring three feet above high water mark, no interruption can then take place. I accompany this with a Plan, in which I have endeavoured to improve the Prin ciples of constructing Iron Bridges, and also their external appearance ; the principal ribs have here their parts all of equal dimensions, which, by cooling equally, will avoid defects hitherto experienced in structures of this sort; the Road-way, instead of being supported by circles or perpendicular pillars as for merly, is sustained by lozenge forms, which preserve strait lines and keep the points of pressure in the direction of the radii; the covering plates, instead of being solid as formerly, are to be made reticulated, something in the way of Malt-kiln tiles, which enables them to be made thicker, and yet so as to save a very considerable portion of iron, and consequently weight. \u2014 The Estimate of the expense is \u00a39736.. 6.. 8.\" \u2014 This Plan having obtained the approbation of the County of Sutherland, will be effected without delay. By means ofthis Bridge and that at Lovat when completed, the benefit of the Highland Road and Bridge Act will have been largely extended in completing the communication ofthe Great Highland Road without the intervention of any Ferry, quite to the Northern extremity of Great Britain; the Bridges of Dunkeld, Lovat, Conan, and Bonar, forming a connected Series of Bridges, which for size, solidity, and utility, is not surpassed any where in the Kingdom.

It is in the Presbytery of Dumbarton, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 2460, and, in 1811, was 2791. It is 3. m. N. from Dumbarton. This Parish is about A\\ miles in length, and 4 miles in breadth, stretching along both sides of the river Leven: on the banks of which, several extensive and flourishing print-fields, and bleach fields, are established. The soil, in the low grounds, is partly a rich loam, and partly a light gravel ; but the rising ground is more wet, and tilly, and part of it is covered with heath : it is all inclosed, and subdivided. The river Leven is remarkable for the softness of its water, and the clearness of its stream ; it issues from Loch Lomond, and is navigable for one half of the year ; the tide flows more than a third of its length, and where the tide fails, the vessels of a parti cular construction are drawn up the river by horses ; the salmon produced in it, are esteemed among the best in Scotland. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, and perquisites. The woods are famous for the number of Wood cocks, that frequent them during winter ; and, the river and lake, for the great variety of aquatic birds. The House of Darleith, now the property of Mr. Yule, is supposed to have been built by the ancient family of Lennox, before the Estate came into the possession of the Stewarts. The whole of the Parish formerly belonged to the Family of Lennox ; but, in the Fifteenth century, the Darnly family, by marriage, got the greater half of the Estate, and the Titles : the other half went to the Rusky Family, which was afterwards divided between the families of Napier, and Gleneagles ; and the latter Family is still in pos session of the Superiority of several farms, together with considerable Feu duties. The House of Cameron is an old and high Mansion, built in the style of the time ; and, ata little distance, is a Monument erected to the memory ofthe celebrated Tobias Smollet, M. D., by his relative, the late James Smollet, of Bonhil. \"Unavailing monument of affection! Placed on the banks of that Leven, which resounded the first cries of his infancy ; and not long before his departure, its own praises, the tribute of his Muse.\" This charming Ode to Leven Water, paints the beauties of this Vale in colours the most just, chaste, and pleasing : On Leven 's banks while free to rove, And tune the rural pipe to love, I envied not the happiest swain That ever trod th' Arcadian plain. \u2014 Smollet, BONINGTON, v.

E. from Dunse. This Parish contains about 8900 acres. The soil on the high lands, towards the Lammer-Muir Hills, is thin, dry, and poor ; but has of late been much improved by lime and marl: the rest of the Parish, particularly on the banks ofthe Whittadder, which runs through it, is a fertile loam ; but it is occasionally overflowed. The climate is very healthy. Coal is the only fuel used here ; all of which is brought from Northumberland, at a distance of 15 miles, through very bad roads ; and consequently driven in Summer, when the Tweed is fordable. The whole Parish under the Lammer-Muir Hills, as well as the whole of the low parts of the County, are inclosed, principally with hedge and ditch. The Schoolmaster's' salary is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and his emoluments as Precentor and Session Clerk ; besides which he receives \u00a33..15..0. from the Heritors, for collecting the Poor's money, and the Statute road money. Bonkill gives the title of Baron to the ancient and Noble family of Douglas. BONNEY-BRIDGE, in the Shire of Stirling ; and in the Parish of Falkirk. It is3y m. W. S. W. from Falkirk. Some years ago, a person ofthe name of Scott left a small sum of money, for the encouragement ofa School here.

This Parish is about 10 miles in length, and 7 miles in breadth, and is bounded nearly one half of its circumference by the sea ; being indented with several Bays, where vessels may anchor with safety, especially in Ross Bay, and Bridgehouse, Kirk- Andrew's, and Knockbrix ays: the other parts ofthe coast are bold, and rocky, and furnish samphire, and kelp, in the interstices, in great abundance.. The surface is uneven, but there are no lofty hills; the soil is, for the most part, f"], [233, "BOR a fine loam, and, in showery seasons, is very productive. The climate is healthy. The manures chiefly employed are lime, marl, and sea-shells ; of the latter of which, there are inexhaustible stores. This district has long been deservedly celebrated for fine honey. The Parochial School is well attended, and the emoluments are about \u00a330. per annum, on the average. There are two fine old Ruins in the Parish ; one of them called The Tower of Balmangan, the other, Plunton Castle; besides which, there are several remains of ancient fortifications, particularly, Tlie Dun of Boreland, and the strong entrenchments on the Farm of Borne as.

It is \\ m. N. W. from Auchterarder. This Village was originally built by Govern ment, for the accommodation of the soldiers who were disbanded after the war in 1763: but most of them left it very soon afterwards, though the terms of their settlement were very advantageous. It is now principally inhabited by weavers. BOROUGH-BRIDGE, v. SPYNIE. BOROUGH-MOOR, in the Shire of Edinburgh ; and in the Parish of St. Cuthbert. It is adjacent to the City of Edinburgh, on the South. In the West end of the Borough-Moor, there stood a large Chapel, dedicated to St. Roque, and round it there was a Cemetery, where those persons in Edinburgh, who died ofthe Plague, were interred. The Town-Councils in 1532, granted four acres of ground in the Borough-Moor to Sir John Young, the Chaplain, for which he was bound to keep the roof and windows of the Chapel in repair ; but, agreeably to the general embezzlement of Religious and Charitable Foundations which took place at the Reformation, no services were performed, but the very Church and Church-yard were converted into private property. The loss of this piece of ground is severely felt by the Citizens, whose Burying-ground, which lies within the City, is by no means adequate to the vast increase of the Inhabitants. A considerable part ofthe Walls ofthis Chapel is still standing, and Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. This Moor appears, in 15J.3, to have abounded with large Oak Trees ; and here King James the Fourth reviewed his army, before he marched to the fatal Battle of Flodden- Field. BORROWFIELD, v.

Prior to the year 1634, Borrowstown-Ness belonged to the Parish of Kinneil : the Inhabitants then becoming numerous, built a Church, finding it inconvenient to travel nearly two miles to the Old Church at Kinneil ; and petitioned the Parliament of Scotland, in 1649, for a disjunction, and a separate Minister : The prayer of the Petition was granted by Parliament, and after several visitations, the Presbytery of Linlithgow found it necessary, that Borrowstown-Ness should be erected into a Parisii by itself, bounded on the South, by Graham's Dyke ; on the North, by the Sea ; on the East, by Thirlestone ; and on the West, by the Castle Wall, commonly called \" Capie's Wall.\" In the month of December 1669, The Duke and Duchess of Hamilton, obtained an Act of the Scotch Parliament, declaring the Church lately built within the Town, to be \" The Kirk of the hail Barony of Kinneil and Borrowstown-Ness ;\" From that period, the Parishes have been united, and considered as one : and this Parish is now about 4 English miles in length, from East to West, and about 2| miles in breadth, from North to South. The Minister's Stipend, in 1811, was \u00a370. Sterling in money, 3 chalders of victual, together with 3 chalders of coals, a glebe of 6 acres, and \u00a310. in lieu ofa Manse, which has not yet been provided by the Family of Hamilton : The Duke of Hamilton, who is Patron, is also at the expense of Communion elements : The Church is a good plain Edifice. It is in the Presbytery of Linlithgow, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population ofthis Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 2790, and, in 1811, was 2704. It is 18 m. W. b. N. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. The surface of the high ground, or dry-field, is uneven, rising gradually from the Forth to the South, and sloping gently on the West, to the banks of the Avon: the soil is a deep loam, well cultivated, and mostly inclosed. It is a Burgh of Barony, governed by a Baillie appointed by The Duke of Hamilton. No certain information can be obtained when it was built, or when it it was erected into a Burgh of Regality ; but it was made a Burgh of Barony, when the Jurisdiction Act was repealed in 1748. The Harbour of Borrowstown-Ness is one of the safest, and most com modious in the Firth of Forth. In 1680, it was controverted, whether this could be a Port of Entry, in opposition to Blackness, the Port of Linlithgow: but, after a long discussion, Borrowstown-Ness was declared to be a Port, for Shipping : the depth ofthe Harbour, in Spring-tides, is from 16 to 18 feet. Grange-Mouth,"], [235, "BOR South Queen's Ferry, North Queen's Ferry, St. David's, Iriver-Keithing, Lime kilns, Torry, and Culross, are united to the Custom-House here ; the business of which employs about 44 officers. Here is a very considerable trade in Ship building, for which this place has long been famous. There are extensive Manu factories of Salt, and Stone-ware : and abundance of excellent coal is exported. Quarries of free-stone, and granite, are also worked. There are five Schools in the Town, and Parish, well attended : the Salary ofthe Parochial School-master being* 300 merks Scotch, besides perquisites, and School-fees. The Duke of Hamilton is Proprietor' and Superior of the whole Parish of Borrowstown-Ness, except the farm of Muir- House. The Roman Wall, called Graham's Dyke, between the Forth and Clyde, runs through the high grounds, the whole length of the Parisii : it is still distinctly visible on the East bank of the Avon : and, at Inver- Avon, the ruins of a Roman Tower still remain : where in a window of the adjacent Farm-house, is a stone with several Hieroglyphics upon it. At Low-water, above 2000 acres opposite to the Parish are left dry ; which, it is said, a Dutch Company offered to reclaim from the sea, but their pro posals were imprudently rejected. The Roads are in good repair, See, Kinneil. Castle Lyon, which stood of old on the Shore ofthe Forth, below Kinneil Castle, is now completely overflowed. The Fair is holden on the 16th of November. BORTHWICK, and BORTHWICK-BRAE, v. ROBERTON. BORTHWICK, anciently LOCHERWORTH, in the Shire of Edinburgh : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3 157. all paid in money ; the manse is very old, but in tolerable repair ; the offices, and garden, are excel lent : the glebe, which is adjacent, consists of rather more than 12 Scotch acres, and is inclosed: Patron, The Right Honourable Robert Dundas, Lord Chief Baron : The old Church, which was built in the form of a Cross, and dedicated to St. Kentigern, was accidentally burned, in May 1775 : but a more commo dious Church was built, in 1778, about forty yards from the site ofthe old one, and entirely without the Burying-ground ; and, much to the credit of the Heri tors, is superior to any other Church in the neighbourhood. It is in the Presby tery of Dalkeith, and Synod of Lothian ant. Tweeddale. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (comprising the Villages of Borthwick, Ford, Middleton, and Vogrie) was 842, and, in 1811, was 1166. It is 1 m. N. E. from Middleton. This Parish is about 6 miles in length, and 4 miles in breadth : the soil is various, being in some parts kindly andlight, in others consisting of qlay, and loam ; and, Z2"], [236, "BOR on the higher grounds, it is rather cold, and somewhat marshy. The climate is also various ; but, upon the whole, it is mild, and the inhabitants are in general healthy. Coals, and lime-stone, abound here, and are worked to a great extent : there are also Gun-powder Mills. In this Parish, services of every kind are almost entirely abolished, and payment is made in money, in lieu of them ; ex- cept in some instances, when a certain quantity of Poultry is furnished to the Proprietors by their tenants. The Salary of the Schoolmaster at Borthwick is 300 merks, together with perquisites, and School-fees, and a small house, and garden. This Parish has produced many eminent men ; \u2014 in Literature, the late Principal Robertson: \u2014 and in Law, the several Dundases, of Arniston. On the lands of Harvieston, beautifully situate by the side of the river Gore, is a Ruin, which is said to have been the residence ofthe family of Borthwick, be- fore they were created Peers, or had risen to such eminence in this country. The Manor of Locherworth, according to Mr. Chalmers, lies also upon the Gore water, which is formed of two streams, that are now called the Burns of North and South Middleton. The Church stands on the bank of the last, a short dis- tance above its junction with the Gore. Below the Church, on the West bank ofthe Gore, at the confluence of the two streams, stands the Castle of Borthwick, which was built on the ancient site of Locherworth Moat : on the East, from this position, at some distance stood the Hamlet of Little Locherworth, where there is still a Village, that bears the old name, in the corrupted form of Lochuharret. In 1449, Peter Crichton, the Parson of Locherworth, consented to the dissolution of his Rectory, and to the assignment of many ofthe Revenues, to the Collegiate Church of Crichton. During the Twelfth century, the Manor of Locherworth belonged to the family of Lyne, who enjoyed it till the reign of Alexander the Second, when it went with Margaret de Lyne, a Co-heiress, to Sir John de Hay. The Hays retained possession of the whole Manor of Locherworth, till the reign of James the First. Sir William Hay, having changed his residence from Locherworth to Yester, sold the greater part of his ancient Manor, with the Mansion, to Sir William de Borthwick ; retaining Little Locherworth, with its pertinents. Sir William now resolved to build a Castle on the ancient site of Locherworth : and accordingly he erected a Cas tellated House, which he called Borthwick Castle, from the family name, which his Progenitors had assumed, from Borthwick, in the Shire of Selkirk. The Founder of that House was created Lord Borthwick, in 1433 : and the Castle of Borthwick became now the seat of his Barony. The name of Borthwick was."], [237, "BOS not applied to the Church and Parish, until the Reformation. In 1596, James the Sixth withdrew from the Collegiate Church of Crichton those Prebends, with their Revenues : and restored them to the Parsonage of Borthwick, whence they had been taken: and the King's Charter, for those purposes, was confirmed by the Parliament of July 1606 : which Charter was also confirmed by the Diocesan Bishop. The Castle of Borthwick was of great strength, and its Noble Owners were uniformly men of great honour and loyalty. John, the eighth Lord Borth wick, had, during all the Civil war, remained firmly attached to the Royal cause, which was sufficient to draw upon him the vengeance of the Protector : and, accordingly, on the 18th of November 1650, a peremptory Summons was addressed to him by Cromwell, from Edinburgh, requiring an immediate sur render : when, having made a bold stand, and seeing no appearance of relief, His Lordship obtained very honourable terms of capitulation, viz., \" liberty to march out with his Lady, and Family, unmolested, and fifteen days allowed to remove his effects.\" Mr. Hepburn, of Clerkington, is now Proprietor ofthe Castle, and Lands of Borthwick. Mr. Grose has preserved a View of this Castle. The House of Arniston is the elegant Seat of Lord Chief Baron Dundas : The Lands of Arniston were one ofthe Prebends, which belonged to the Collegiate Church of Crichton. The Barony of Borthwick is claimed by Archibald Borthwick, Esq., who is descended from Alexander Borthwick, of Sauchnell, brother of William, the third Baron, next male heir ofthe first, second, and third Barons Borthwick.

St. Boswell's Fair is holden annually on the 18th of July, upon a large green of the same name, through which the turnpike road passes from the Lothians to Jedburgh, and into Northumberland : it holds in the name of His Grace The Duke of Buccleugh, and is said to be the greatest Fair in the South of Scotland. There is an established Schoolmaster in Les sudden, where he has a comfortable house, and a Salary of 300 merks, and perquisites. The greatest disadvantage under which this Parish labours, is the scarcity of fuel.

The climate is in general healthy; though, from the elevated situation"], [239, "BOT ofthe Parish, it is cold. Here are the remains of an Abbey; founded by one of the Countesses of March, during the reign of William the Lyon; and for which Ada, the Prioress, swore fealty to Edward the First, in 1296. It was a Cell to South Berwick, and was of the Cistertian Order. About a quarter ofa mile from the Nunnery, and on the same side of the river, lie the foundations of a small Chapel and Yard holding that name : but there are no marks of persons having been buried in it. About a mile from the Nunnery, on the North side of the river Whittadder, is situate Trois Fontaines, i. e. The Three Fountains, On the side of Manegnut ivater, which empties itself into the Whittadder here, and where the remains of an Hospital and Burying-ground are yet extant, founded by David the First, and also dependent on South Berwick. Tradition relates, that a subterraneous passage went from the Nunnery of St. Bothan's, below the water of Whittadder, to this Chapel, along which the Nuns went to be confessed by the clergy from Coldingham, who had a House at God's Croft in this Parish, and at a little distance from the Chapel.

This Parish is about a mile and a half in length, and nearly of equal breadth, and is situate in that tract of country, commonly called The Carse of Falkirk. It is perfectly level through its whole extent, and every acre is inclosed, and well cultivated: the soil is mostly a deep clay, and is very abundant. The climate is uncommonly healthy. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a house and small garden. The Roads are in good repair; and, a little above Grangemouth, is a Bridge over the river Carr on. BOTHWELL, in the Middle Ward, and Shire of Lanark: formerly a Col legiate Church, the Stipend of which, in 1795, was 6 chalders and one boll of meal, one chalder of bear, and \u00a346.. 18. .0. in money: the manse is in good repair, and a considerable addition is now (in 1812) making to it: the glebe consists of upwards of 4 acres, and a garden : Patron, The Duke of Hamilton : The Church, which is very ancient^is in decent condition. It is in the Presbytery of Hamilton,"], [240, "BOT and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (containing the Divisions of Woodhall, Lauchope, and Sideridge; Stevenson, Cl eland, Carfin, and Tirviston; Upper and Lower Orbiston ; back of Moor, andCambrae; Uddingston, and Out-farms; and Bothwell, Out -farms, and Bothwell Castle) was 3017, and, in 1811, was 3745. It is 3 m. N.W. from Hamilton. This is a great, noble, and extensive Barony, stretching along the Eastern bank ofthe mer Clyde for about 8j miles in length, and 4 miles in breadth. The soil is excellent, and well cultivated. The climate is healthy. The Salary of the Parochial School is 400 merks Scotch. It is watered by thG rivers Clyde, and the North and South Calders. The roads, and bridges, are in good repair. Coals, and free-stone, are in abundance. The Castle of Both- well, situate on the Northern bank of the Clyde, exhibits, even in its decayed state, some striking remains of its former splendour. This Castle made a con- spicuous figure in the History of Scotland : but, concerning the date of its origin, both history and tradition are equally silent. In the reign of Edward the First, it was the residence ofthe English Governor of Scotland, Aylmer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, and it was hither that this Monarch fled upon his defeat by Bruce, at the battle of Loudon Hill, in 1307. On the forfeiture of The Earl of Pembroke, it had a variety of Possessors; and, among the rest, the man most notoriously marked in the Annals of Scotland for the audacity and splen- dour of his crimes, The Earl of Bothwell, v/hose name it still bears. From Bothwell it descended to Archibald Tlie Grim, Earl of Douglas, in whose family it continued until their Attainder in 1445. After a variety of trans- missions, it reverted to the family of Douglas in 1715, in whose possession it now remains. The Collegiate Church of Bothwell was founded on the 10th of October 1398, in the Reign of Robert the Second, by Archibald The Grim, Lord of Galloway, afterwards Earl of Douglas, for a Provost, and eight Prebendaries, and was very richly endowed: most ofthe Superiorities, with part ofthe property, and all the Tythes, now belong to The Duke of Ha- milton, who is both Patron and Titular. Near Bothwell Bridge, the Coven- anters were defeated by The Duke of Monmouth, in 1679 : and, a little above it, is Bothwell- Haugh, formerly the property of James Hamilton, who having embraced the party of his Royal Mistress, Mary Stuart, a part of his estate was, in consequence, bestowed by the Regent Murray on one of his favourites ; who, in a winter's night, seized on his house, and turned his wife naked into the open fields ; where, before morning, she became furiously mad. Love and party rage co-operated so strongly, that he could not rest until he had executed hiss"], [241, "BOU vengeance: he followed the Regent from place to place, till the opportunity of a slow march, on the 23d of January 1570, through a crowded street in Lin lithgow, rendered his intent successful, when \" with a blameless revenge\" he shot the Regent dead. He fled to France, and being there solicited to destroy the Admiral Coligni, he replied with a generous resentment, \" That notwith standing his injured affection compelled him to commit one murder, nothing should induce him to prostitute his sword in a base assassination.\" The House of Bothwell, the residence of Lord Douglas, is an extensive and noble structure, situate a little to the Eastward of the old Castle ; and at once commands the charming group of beauties, arising from the wooded banks, the river, the ruins, and the adjacent country. The late William Aiton, the Scotch Linn\u00e6us, and author of \" Hortus Kewensis\" , was a native ofthis Parish, BOTRIPHNIE, in the Shire of Banff : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a347.. 5.. 0.

It is in the Pres bytery of Strath-Bogie, and Synod of Moray. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 589, and, in 1811, was 577. It is 5 m. S. W. from Keith. This Parish is about 4-\u00a7- miles in length, and about 3 miles in breadth : the greater part of it consists of one beautiful Strath, between two ridges of hills, with the little river Isla running through the middle of it : and on the banks of which, very extensive plantations have lately been made. The soil is fertile, being generally of a rich black loam, and, in some places, a strong clay. Lime stone, of an excellent quality, is to be met with in every field. Several Services are still injudiciously exacted ofthe Tenants. A considerable quantity of Linen cloth is manufactured here. The Salary of the Parochial Schoolmaster is 300 merks, and a rood of land, together with School-fees, and a few perquisites. The Roads are in tolerable repair. The neighbouring* hills supply the inhabit ants with peat, and turf; but, as these mosses are becoming daily more and more scarce, the Heritors restrict their Tenants to a certain number of subsets : however, as the duty on coals carried Coast-ways is now taken off, the difficulty of providing fuel is removed. BOUDANE-HILL, v. TORPHICHEN, _ BOURTIE, in the District of Garioch, and Shire of Aberdeen : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 32 bolls of meal, 16 bolls of bear, yoL. i.

This Parisii contains about 4000 acres. The soil is in general a strong clay, tolerably fertile, and a great part is inclosed, and well cultivated. Peats are the principal fuel. Upon the summit of the hill of Barra, are the vestiges of an extensive circular camp ; where, tradition reports, Thomas de Longueville, the brave associate of Sir William Wallace, was killed. There are three Druidical circles, two of which are pretty entire. BOURTREE-HILL, v. IRVINE. BOW BUTTS, v. GLEN CAIRN. BOWDEN, in the District of Melros, and Shire of Roxburgh : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 5 chalders of victual, Linlithgow measure, two-thirds of which are payable in oatmeal, and one-third in barley, 400 merks in money; and \u00a38. 16.. 8. for Communion elements ; the glebe is 16 English acres, of which about 3 acres are meadow ; the manse, and offices, are excellent : Patron, The Duke of Roxburgh : The Church is old, long, narrow, and out of repair; and a vault, adjoining to it, is the Cemetery ofthe Ducal family of Roxburgh. It is in the Presbytery of Selkirk, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 829, and, in 1811, was 865. It is 2| m. S. from Melros. This Parish contains nearly 6700 English acres, by measurement. The surface is much varied : but the soil is fertile, and well cultivated : and, upon the whole, the Inhabitants enjoy good health. The great disadvantage under which this Parish labours, is the distance from lime, and coals. The Parochial Schoolmaster, at Bowden, has a Salary of \u00a38.. 6. .8. Ste rling, besides School-fees, and about \u00a33. for collecting the Poor's Rates, together with a dwelling-house and garden worth \u00a32., making in all about \u00a330. per annum. There is also a School, and a School-house, at Middle ham; the master of which has a Salary of \u00a33., together with his victuals, during the teaching season, from the different parents of the Children, being in the whole about \u00a37. or \u00a38. Sterling. The Roads are pretty well taken care of by the Justices of the District. Game abounds here. The remains of a Military Road, with circular stations or camps, at the distance of two or three miles, supposed to be Roman, may be traced, running nearly North through the eentre and broadest part of the Parish, about a mile to the Westward of the"], [243, "BOW Church : in some places, all vestiges of it are destroyed by the plough ; but, in other parts, traces of it are still visible, in the form ofa large bank about 20 feet wide ; and, in some spots, of two banks of that width, at the distance of 50 feet from each other : the camps or stations are all upon eminences in view of each other ; and different weapons have been discovered on ploughing, or ditching around them, as well as in the adjacent mosses. Blackchester, a strong Station, is situate on an eminence, in the South-East extremity of the Parish, on the North ofthe river Ale : it is a, parallelogram, with its corners rounded off, and was defended by a double fosse, and rampart. The remains of the Roman road leading to it, is here called The Ox-Road. The Family of Carre, of Cavers, one ofthe most ancient in the South of Scotland, have had their chief residence in this Parish, for many generations : George Carre, Esq., of Nisbet, a Lord of Session, was descended from a branch ofthis Family : they are supposed to have sprung from Ker, of Ferniherst: one of their ancestors claimed the title of Lord Jedburgh ; but, from the different manner in which they spell their name, it seems probable, either that they are a distinct family, or a very old Cadet. See, Holy-Dean. BOWER, in the Shire of Caithness : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, is 4 chalders of victual, 600 merks in money, and 100 merks for Communion elements : Patron, Sir John Sinclair : The Church is in decent repair. It is in the Presbytery of Caithness, and Synod of Caithness and Sutherland. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 1572, and, in 1811, was 1478. It is 10 m. N. W. from Wick. This Parish is 7 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth. The surface is flat, and the cultivated land consists principally ofa long Strath, which is bounded on the North and South by a ridge of green hill. Most of the Commons are capable of being converted into good arable ground ; but, from the practice of cultivating the land in patches, with a runrig to every small farm, much valuable soil is neglected : it is principally a strong clay, and loam. There are several tumuli, of which The Cairn of Heather Cow, surrounded by six or seven circles of large stones, is the most entire : it is situate on an eminence, and commands a very extensive prospect. Peat-moss is the only article of fuel, of which there is great abun dance. Personal services are mostly converted into money. The cultivation of flax, and the weaving of linen cloths, are daily increasing in this County. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, and perquisites : this wasforirerly one ofthe most flourishing Schools in Caithness, but, for some years past, it hag Aa2"], [244, "BOY had no legally qualified teacher. Mr. Alexander Miller, a merchant in Thurso, very liberally allows \u00a35. per annum to a private School in this Parish, for teaching poor children. Here the Archdeacon of Caithness resided ; and The Pope was anciently the Patron. The Parish of Wattin originally constituted part ofthis Parish. BOWEST, v. COLL, ISLAND. BOWLING, BAY, v. KILL-PATRICK, OLD. BOWMORE, in the Island of Islay, and Shire of Argyle : in the Parisii of Kill-Arrow. This is a neat, and improving Village, situate at the extremity of the Bay of Loch-in-Daul, and has an excellent Harbour, and a fine Quay for vessels drawing from 8 to 10 feet water. The Parish of Kill- Arrow is now fre quently called Bowmore; from the circumstance ofthe old Church at Kill- Arrow having been demolished, and the present elegant Church erected at the end of one of the principal Streets of the Village of Bowmore. It is 10^ m. S.S. W. from Port-Askaig. BOWNESS, or SLAINS CASTLE, v. CRUDEN BOYNDIE, in the Shire of Banff : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 60 bolls of victual, and \u00a339. in money : Patron, The Earl of Seafield : The Church is in good repair. It is in the Presbytery of Fordyce, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (in cluding the Sea-Town of Whitehills) was 1122, and, in 1811, was 1128. It is 4 m. W. b. N. from Banff. This Parish is about five miles long, and from a mile to a mile and a half in breadth ; and contains about 3000 acres : above one half are arable, and 400 acres are planted with wood of different kinds, but chiefly with Scotch fir : the soil is various. This Parish was one of the first in the North of Scotland, in which the new System of Husbandry was attempted, and carried on with success, by the example and encouragement ofthe late Earl of Findlater. The Rent is mostly paid in victual. The Salary ofthe School master is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a rood of land. Boyne Castle is romantically situate on a high, perpendicular rock, on the South side ofa deep gloomy ravine or glen, through which the river Boyndie flows : its banks being wooded quite to the water's edge. This was the Baronial Castle of the District, called Tlie Boyne, and anciently the residence of the Noble Family of Ogilvie, ancestors of its late worthy Proprietor, The Earl of Findlater and Seafield : It is now quite a ruin. Mr. Grose has preserved two Views of it."], [245, "BRA BOYNE, THE, v. BOYNDIE. BRAAL, CASTLE, v. HALKIRK. BRABSTER, CASTLE, v. CANISBAY.

It is in the Presbytery of Skye, and Synod of Glenelg. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1865, and, in 1811, was 1869. It is of an irregular form, being intersected by arms ofthe sea in different directions. The length of the inhabited part is about 17 computed miles : the breadth in one part is seven, and in other places about four miles. The surface, in general, is hilly, with some plain spots adjacent to the sea: and the soil is in some parts fertile. The air is moist and foggy, but not unhealthy. There are no considerable Lakes or Rivers, and none that are navigable. The Shore is in some places flat ; but, for the most part, it is high, and rocky. About 50 tons of kelp are annually made here. The principal Bays are Loch Braca- dale, Loch Harport, and Loch Eynart ; the former of which is a good and safe Harbour. The Islands belonging to this Parisii are Haversay, Vuiay, Oransay, and Soay : these Islands are not inhabited, and are only pendicles to the different Farms on the shore that are opposite to them, and afford pasture for cattle, during part ofthe summer and winter seasons. Tliere are no remarkable moun- tains : but a considerable ridge of very high and lofty hills, called The Forest of the Island of Skye, run between this Parish, and the Parish of Strath, and are the property of Lord Macdonald, Colonel Macleod, and Mr. Macalister, of Strath Aird : they afford pasture to numerous herds and flocks : and, upon the whole, this Parish is better adapted for grazing and rearing cattle and sheep, than for corn. The Gaelic is the principal language spoken here. The peat mosses are extensive, and of an excellent kind. Taliscar, the residence of Colonel Macleod, \" is the place beyond all that I have seen,\" says Dr. Johnson, '*- from which the gay and the jovial seem utterly excluded ; and where the hermit might expect to grow old in meditation, without possibility of disturbance"], [246, "BRA or interruption. It is situated very near the sea, but upon a coast where no vessel lands but when it is driven by a tempest on the rocks. Towards the land are lofty hills, streaming with water-falls. The garden is sheltered by firs, or pines, which grow tliere so prosperously, that some, which the present inhabit ant planted, are very high and thick.\" Here Dr. Johnson happily met with Mr. Donald Maclean, a young* Gentleman, the eldest son of the Laird of Col, whose friendship and services he so beautifully describes, and whose death he so pathetically deplores in his Journey to the Western Islands.

This is an increasing Village; through which the great Roman Road, called Watling Street, passes. The lands of Bradwood belonged to the ancient Castle of Hall-Bar, but have since been feued out by The Earl of Lauderdale, and Mr. Lockhart, of Carnwath, who have chosen to retain this Tower and small Garden, with free \" ish and entry\" , and which they rent at about IO*.

It is situate on the Eastern bank ofthe river Carron. BRAE-MAR, in the District of Kincardine O'Neil, and Shire of Aberdeen : an ancient Parish, now united to the Parish of Crathie : The Church is a very neat building, with an excellent Church-yard walled round, and supported almost at the sole expense of The Earl of Fife, and Mr. Farquharson, of Inver cauld. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 905, and, in 1811, was 945. It is 33 m. W. S. W. from Kincardine O'Neil. This is a very mountainous Parish, and is supposed to be more elevated above the level of the sea, and farther removed in every direction from the coast, than any other Parish in Scotland. Lime-stone is in great plenty ; and there is also a good Slate Quarry upon Mr. Farquharson's estate. The Forest is very extensive, and well stocked with red deer, and roes. The Gaelic is the prevailing language. Here is one ofthe Society's Schools, with a Salary of \u00a314. Sterling, and other perqui sites : Besides which, there is a mortification of 5000 merks by the late John"], [247, "B R E Farquharson, Esq. , of Invercauld, for the purpose of maintaining and educating some poor boys, of the name of Farquharson, at the Charity Schools. Near the Village of Castle- Town of Brae-Mar , which is situate on the great Military road, are the ruins of an old Castle, said to have been a Hunting-Seat of King Malcolm Canmore. At a short distance from hence, is the Castle of Brae- Mar, formerly the Seat ofthe ancient Earls of Mar ; but, in later times, a Garrison, to curb the discontented Chieftains ; and, at present, unnecessarily occupied by a Company of Foot, being rented by Government froin Mr. Farquharson, of Invercauld, to whose family it came by purchase in 1730. In this Vale, The Earl of Mar first set up the Pretender's Standard, on the 6th of September 1715: and, in consequence, drew to destruction his own, and several ofthe most Noble families of North Britain. Invercauld, the Seat of the ancient and patriotic Family of Farquharson, is seated in the centre ofthe Grampian hills, in a fertile vale, washed by the Dee, and surrounded by millions of trees of their own planting : the house is large, and elegantly furnished, and nothing can be more beautiful than the different views from the several parts of it : Mr. Farquharson's breed of cattle are much esteemed.

It is mountainous and rugged, lying among the Grampians, and is supposed to be the highest land in Scotland. It gives the title of Earl to a branch of the Ancient and Illustrious Family of Campbell. John Campbell, who was created Earl of Caithness (but, in 1681, that title, on a claim and petition, being allowed by Parliament to be vested in George Sinclair, who"], [248, "B R E was the Sixth Earl of Caithness) was, instead thereof, created Earl of Breadal bane, with precedence according to the former Patent. See, Kenmore. BRECHIN, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Shire of Forfar : a Collegiate Charge ; the Stipend of the Senior Minister, in 1811, was in the whole 15 \\ chalders of grain ; more than one half of which are oat-meal, 3^ bolls of them are wheat, and the remainder is paid in barley, together with \u00a38. .6.. 8. for Communion elements: The Stipend of the Second Minister being 4 chalders of barley, 2 chalders of meal, \u00a352..14..0. in money, \u00a38..6..8. for Communion elements, together with a manse, offices, and a glebe of 6 acres : The Crown is Patron of both these Benefices : The Cathedral is an ancient Gothic Building, and was elegantly repaired a few years ago: it was the See ofa Bishop, and was founded about the year 1150 by King David the First, and very richly endowed. It is in the Presbytery of Brechin, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 5466, and, in 1811, was 5559. It is 66 m. N. b. E. from Edinburgh. The Market is on Tuesday, which is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the third Wednesday in April, the second Wednesday in June, and the second Wednesday in August. A General Post-Office is established here. It is pleasantly situate on the lowest extremity of a rising ground which here termi nates in a ravine or den, the foot of which is washed by the river South Esk; and over which there is a very ancient stone Bridge, of two large arches, and a handsome one of wood, with stone arches, built by The Honourable William Maule. In former times, it was encompassed by a strong Wall, but no vestiges either ofthe gates or walls now remain. It has twice been ruined by fire ; first, by the Danes, in 1012 ; and afterwards by The Marquis of Montrose, in the year 1645. It now consists of a steep, but tolerably broad street, with smaller ones diverging* from it; and is well watered by means of leaden pipes, laid down at the expense of the late Earl of Panmure. Brechin, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of Aberdeen, Aber-Brothock, InverrBervie, and Montrose, sends one Member to Parliament. The Burgh is governed by a Provost, two Baillies, a Dean of Guild, a Town Treasurer, an Hospital Master, a Convener of Trades, and six Ordinary Counsellors. The Royalty extends about a quarter of a mile every way from the Cross ; but the Suburbs stretch to a considerable distance towards the East and South, and are called The Upper and Nether Tenements: Both are independent of the Borough, and are holden in feu mostly from Sir James Carnegie, Bart., of South Esk. On the North-West corner of the"], [249, "B R E Cathedral, stands a handsome square Tower 120 feet high, and certainly built at the same time with the Cathedral ; and, on the South-West corner, is one of those remarkable Round Towers, concerning the use of which, Antiquaries are so much divided ; it is 103 feet high, having a diameter of only 16 feet over the walls at the base, and at the top, before the octagonal spire begins, of 12 feet 2 inches : a View, and Description of it, are preserved in the Second Volume of Arch\u00e6ologia. Brechin was, in an early age, a distinguished seat of the Culdees, who were suppressed or superseded here, before the time of Robert Bruce, or soon aster he came to the Throne. Keith states, that a Monastery of Red Friars here is mentioned in ancient Charters and Records ; but not having seen any distinct account of them, he is uncertain when, or by whom it was founded. Here was also an Hospital, founded in 1256 ; which, from the small vestiges of its ruins, seems to have been a neat little building: The Magistrates are now Patrons of its funds, and the feus paid to its Preceptor constitute the Salary paid to the Master of the Grammar School, which is by no means incon siderable; handsome Schools are at present building by public Subscription, for the Grammar Master, a Teacher of English, who by Salary, his diligence in teaching, and other emoluments, is in the receipt of upwards of \u00a3100. per annum, and a Writing Master to be engaged. The manufactures consist chiefly of sail cloth, osnaburghs, and webs ofa thinner fabric. On an average of the last five years, upwards of 155,000 yards of sail cloth have been manufactured; and, on an average often or twelve years, 730,000 yards of all other kinds of cloth have been annually stamped here. There is also a Brewery, in which between five and six Thousand barrels of Porter were, in 1811, prepared for sale; as the work is now enlarged, it is rendered capable of brewing 20,000 barrels annually: Porter is exported from it to London, and other parts ofthe Kingdom, and to the West Indies. Contiguous to the Town, are three Flax spinning mills, the smallest of which contains three spinning frames, the next contains eleven, and the largest thirty, and all together give employment to about 180 persons. The climate is dry, and, in general, healthy. \u2014 The Parish of Brechin sweeps a circle of nearly four miles around the City; it gradually rises on each side of the river South Esk, which runs through the middle of it; and along which the tide flows within five miles ofthe Town. It was proposed, some years ago, to conduct a Canal from hence to the Ocean at Montrose, a distance only of eight miles; but, though the expense would not have been by any means great, the scheme was abandoned. The soil is for the most part rich and fertile, especially on the North side of the river, and contiguous to it on the West. Here is abundance of excellent vol, i. B b"], [250, "B R E free-stone. Coals, brought from various parts of the Firth of Forth, but, chiefly from Sunderland and Newcastle, are the only fuel. The low grounds, on both sides ofthe river, are occasionally inundated. Brechin Castle, the prin cipal residence of The Honourable William Ramsay Maule, is built on the brink ofa perpendicular rock, overhanging the South Esk, a little to the South- West ofthe Town, and from its situation, being placed in an angle, one side of which is formed by the Esk and the other by the deep den that divides it from the Town, was in ancient times well chosen for a place of strength : it also prob ably received its name from the nature of its situation, Breech or Breek, in the Gaelic language, signifying a Cleft. In 1303, it sustained an obstinate siege against the English army under Edward the First ; and, notwithstanding every effort of that Prince, it held out for twenty days, 'till the brave Governor, Sir Thomas Maule, was killed by a stone thrown from some engine, on the 20th of August; when the Fortress immediately surrendered. In 1646, a descendant ofthis gallant Chieftain was created Baron Maule of Brechin and Navar, and Earl of Panmure. The present Castle is a modern edifice, having been built by James Earl of Panmure in 1711, and rendered commodious and elegant within, by its present Honourable and amiable Proprietor: it is much admired for its romantic situation: the -woods around it are very luxuriant, and Mr. Maule, a few years ago, laid out gardens of great extent, in a very superior style. William Maitland, F. R. S., who published the Histories of London and Scotland, was a native of Brechin ; as is also John Gillies, LL. D., the learned Histo rian of Greece; and the learned Lawyer, his brother, Adam Gillies, lately created one of The Senators of the College of Justice, and a Lord of Justiciary in Scotland. By the list of the Teind Clerk, ofthe 15th of February 1812, it appears, that there was a grant ofthe Teinds of Balnabreich , in the Parish of Brechin, by King Charles the First in 1641, in favour of the then Minister of Careston, and his successors in office, which are at present in part drawn by the Ministers of Brechin. The Ministers of Careston have maintained an expensive litigation for ten years, to reclaim this fund, hitherto without effect. These Teinds are said to amount to 45 bolls 2 firlots of victual, and \u00a33.. 15.. 0. Sterling ; of which, the First Minister of Brechin draws 28 bolls of victual, and \u00a31..13..4. Sterling ; and the Second Minister draws one boll two firlots and two pecks, and 12s. 5d. The last interlocutor of the Court in this process, was on the 3d of June 1807 : *' On report ofthe Lord Meadowbank, Ordinary, and having advised the libel of u declarator, with the informations for both parties, the Lords, in respect that the"], [251, "B R E \"Officers of State, though parties to this process, have stated no objections to the \" grant of Teinds in question, repel the defences offered for the other defenders, \" and find the Teinds of the lands of Balnabreich belong to the Minister of \" Caraldston, in terms of the grant libeled on, but subject to their burdens in \"favours ofthe Ministers of the Parish of Brechin, in which the lands are situate, \" and without prejudice to their being relieved thereof in case of a future local \" ityof that Parish, and to all objections thereanent.\" There is a process of locality ofthe Stipends of Brechin at present depending. In 1503, Brechin gave the title of Baron to the family of Barclay, now extinct or dormant. BREHAR, or BREYER, one of the Scilly Islands. It is 2| m. N. W. from St. Mary's. This Island is estimated to contain 330 acres. The Resident Popu lation, in 1810, was 100. Samphire, and many kinds of medicinal herbs, are produced here. The coast abounds with fish. It is furnished with a Church. This Island is very mountainous, which its name is said to imply. BRESSY, ISLE, one ofthe Shetland Isles : formerly a Vicarage, with the Parishes of Burray, and Quarts united ; the Stipend of which, in 1795, was \u00a318.. 15 .6f. in money, including Communion elements, 104lispunds 3 merks of butter, 152i cans of oil, with the sheep teind, cow teind, and boat teind, con formable to use and wont : The teinds do not appear to be valued ; the amount of the Rental since 1795 is not stated, and the Vicarage (which, in 1811, is estimated at \u00a322.. 4. .9.) is variable : the glebe is large ; the manse was built in 1732, and was lately repaired at a great expense : Patron, Lord Dundas : There are two Churches, at the distance of 10 English miles from each other : one of them is in Bressay, A*ery near the manse ; the other is in Burray; but they are both in bad repair. It is in the Presbytery of Shetland, and Synod of Orkney, The Resident Population ofthe Islands of Bressay and Noss, in 1801, was 735, and, in 1811, was 776. The Island of Bressay is about 4 miles long, and 2 miles broad ; it lies to the Eastward ofthe Mainland of Shetland, and forms the Eastern protection of Bressay Sound, the safe and commodious Harbour or Road stead of Lerwick, AA'here, it- is believed, the whole British Navy might ride in safety. Bressay Sound is the resort, in time of peace, of several hundred Dutch Busses which annually rendezvous here, at the beginning of June, preparatory to the Herring Fishery. At the North entrance of the Sound is a dangerous rock, called The Unicorn, which is occasionally covered by the sea. When The Earl of Bothwell was driven, to extremities, it is well known, that he com* menced Pirate : and Kirkaldy, of Grange, was sent in pursuit of him, in a Bb2"], [252, "B R I vessel named the The Unicorn. While Kirkaldy entered Bressay Sound by the South, Bothavell narrowly escaped by sailing out at the North entrance : Bothavell's Pilots, it is said, had the cunning to sail very close by a sunk rock, with which they were familiar, thus leading their pursuers, Avho, in the hurry of the chase, Avould naturally follow their track, to a hazard which actually proved fatal to them, and Avhich ensured the escape ofthe unhappy fugitive : since that time, this rock has received the appellation of The Unicorn. The Parish of Bressay contains 366 merks of land, besides outsets, which are not included in the Rentals. The Pasture grounds of the United Parishes are extensive, and feed great numbers of sheep, coavs, oxen, and horses. In some places there are large meadows, which, in faAourable seasons, produce tolerable crops of Hay. The hills afford excellent Peats in great plenty. The Avhole rent is about \u00a34000. Scotch. But the value of Estates in this country is not to be estimated from the Rent only, payable to the Landlords ; the Fisheries which their tenants are obliged to carry on for them, more than double it ; and Services are also demanded, Avhich are sometimes commuted for money. The climate is rather damp, but not unhealthy. The Coasts of these Parishes are, for the most part, bold and rocky. In Bressay there are 26 large Fishing boats, Avhich are fitted out at a considerable expense ; besides, a number of small boats. A few tons of kelp are made here annually. The soil ofthe cultivated parts of Bressay is a fine clay; but neither the climate, nor the soil, are fovourable to agriculture. The Seed-time is commonly from the middle of March to the 1st of May : and the Harvest is, for the most part, finished by the end of September. The Poor of Bressay have the interest of \u00a3150. Scotch, and the rents of 4 merks of land, mortified by The Rev. William Humphrey, formerly Minister of these Parishes. There is an established School. These United Parishes enjoy very considerable advantages : almost all the Inhabitants of Lerwick are supplied with peats from the hills of Bressay, and almost the whole people of Shetland are furnished Avith slates from its excellent Quarries. They have a good Market for every article of Provision. Bressay Sound is in the Latitude of 60c 8' 0\" North. BREWHOUSFS, v. GRAITNEY BREYER, or BRYER, v. BREHAR.

This Parish consists of two ridges of hills, with a valley between"], [256, "B R U them, being about four miles in length, and three miles in breadth. The soil is generally of a deep wet clay, producing good crops, especially in dry seasons ; and agriculture is much attended to. The air is dry, and healthy. The principal disadvantage under which this Parish labours, is the scarcity of fuel , the nearest coal being 16 miles distant : lime is also at the distance of 12 miles. The language spoken here is English, with the Scotch accent. The Stool of Repent ance is said to be in use here, and is the only means hitherto adopted for pre venting the horrid crime of \" Child-Murder.\" The Public road which runs through the Parish, from Edinburgh to Moffat, is kept in good repair ; but the Bye-roads are very bad, and many of them impassable in winter. There is only one Bridge, which is over the river Biggar, about a quarter ofa mile from the Village ; and is in tolerable condition. The Schoolmaster's Salary is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and other perquisites. The Barony of Broughton is said to comprehend the whole Parish, except Burnetland. This Estate was, for many years, in the possession of the Murrays, of Stenhope, avIio resided in the Parish, and was sold by the late Sir John Murray, commonly called Secretary Murray (haA*ing acted in that capacity to The Pretender) to James Dickson, Esq., of Edrum, Member of Parliament for this District of Boroughs in the year 1762; and, above eight years afterwards, it was sold by his heirs to the present Lord Justice Clerk, now Proprietor of the whole Parish. The Mansion-House on this Estate was burnt about 30 years ago, and is not yet re-built. The village of Broughton was re-built, in a handsome manner, by its then liberal and public spirited proprietor, the late James Dickson, Esq.

Buccleugh gives the title of Duke to the Ancient and Illustrious Family of Scott. In 1665, The Duke of Monmouth, marrying Anne, the rich Countess of Buccleugh, and assuming her Name, was created Duke of Buccleugh, as she Avas at the same time created Duchess of Buccleugh. With an allusion to this marriage, perhaps, the Motto of this eminent Family is, Amo. The war-cry of the Scotts, however, according* to Mr. Chalmers, was Alemoor, the usual rendezvous of the whole Clan. The elegant Lay of Leaderhaughs and YarroAV, when lamenting the changes of times and chances, deplores : \u2014 \" For mony a place stands in hard case, Where blyth folk kened nae sorrow, With Homes, that liv'd on Leaderside, And Scotts, that dwelt on Yarrow.\" BUCHAN, a District on the Eastern Coast, comprehending part 6f the vol. i. C <_"], [258, "B U C Shires of Banff, and Aberdeen. The coast is bold, and rocky : and the sur face is in general bleak and barren, though in many places it is fertile, and well cultiAated. The Avhole District formerly belonged to the Cumyns, Earls of Buchan ; but, upon the attainder of that family in 1308, King Robert Bruce divided the lands among his friends ; and, though the title has been reneAved in the Ancient and Noble family of Erskine, the present Earls of Buchan possess little property in this District. Buchan-Ness, or Boddom Head, is a Promontory in the Shire of Aberdeen, about three miles South from Peterhead : it is in the Latitude of 57\u00b0 26' North, and the Longitude of 1\u00b0 47' West from Greenwich. The ancient District of Buchan is now commonly called Deer.

It is in the Presbytery of Dumbarton, and Synod of GlasgoAV and Ayr. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 748, and, in 1811, was 627. It is 1 m. N. W. from Drymen. Tiris Parish extends 18 computed miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth, along the North side of Loch Lomond. The surface is mountainous, with the exception of two fertile and inhabited Vallies, called Glen Dow, and Glen Arclet. The river Enric, which is the Southern boundary, frequently overflows the adjacent grounds. The Grampian hills run through this Parish from South-West to North-East, and diA'ide the Lower from the Higher grounds : the most elevated of these Hills, in this neighbourhood, being Ben Lomond, which is about 3240 feet above the level ofthe sea ; and, from its summit, the prospect is exceedingly grand and extensive.' Several ofthe inhabited Islands in Loch Lomond belong to this Parish ; the most valuable of Avhich are Inch Cailloch, Inch Facl, and Inch Cruin. There are also three small Lakes, called Dulochan, Loch Arclet, and Loch Amnancairn, which abound with trout, and pike. The climate is rainy, but not unhealthy. There are six Heritors, five of whom have a single Farm each; the remainder of the Parish belongs to The Duke of Montrose, who is also Superior of the other five. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees and perquisites, and a house. The Society School is kept at Sallochy, about 6 miles above the Church, for three years ; and then at Inver Snaid, about 7 miles farther up the country, for other three years,"], [259, "B U C alternately : the Salary is 300 merks, as Schoolmaster and Catechist, together with Quarter Avages from those Avho are able to pay ; but he is obliged to teach the Poor gratis. Peats are plentiful, and good. One great advantage which the Lower end ofthis Parish has received of late, is a new line of Road from Dry men to Rowerdennan, which (the Ferry intervening) joins the Great Road from Dumbarton to Inverary on the South side of Loch Lomond : There is always a Ferry-boat kept by the Family of Montrose at Rowerdennan, and another by the Family of Arrochar on the opposite side : The Ferrying-place on the Buch anan side has, of late years, been made pretty convenient for passengers ; a Quay has been built both for the safety of the boats, and for the convenience of horses getting into and out of them ; as also a neat Public-house. On the side of Loch Lomond, near the Church, stands the House of Buchanan, which was the Seat of the ancient Family of Buchanan, for nearly 700 years : But it has for many years past been in the possession of the Illustrious Family of Graham, Duke of Montrose, Avho has made considerable improvements and plantations around it.

The original inhab itants are said to have been from Brabant, their vessel being stranded on this shore, about the time of Philip the Second ; when they were permitted to settle here by the family of Wemyss. They are a sensible, honest, industrious set of people, seldom intermarrying out of the Village, and consequently retaining a phraseology and accent peculiar to themselves.

This Parish is about 8 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth. The soil is kindly, and fertile ; and the hills, which are mostly green and without heath, are cultivated to their very summits. At Barlochan, or Garden Creek, a Port in the river Urr, which is navigable from the Solway Firth for vessels of 50 tons burden, the greater part of the Parish is supplied Avith coals and lime : and, at Munshes, about a mile farther up the river, these useful commodities are also occasionally landed. The roads are tolerable. The climate is healthy. Here are two Schools; one of them Avith a Salary of \u00a315. ; and the other of \u00a33. per annum, only. The coast, on the Solway Firth, abounds with fish of various kinds. Here are some subterraneous passages, which haA*e hitherto been unexplored: and, upon the summit of one ofthe hills, are the remains ofa vitrified Fort. The Baronial Castle of Buittle, now in ruins, is situate on the West side ofthe Water of Urr, and is said to have been built out of the mate rials ofa very ancient Castle of the same name, by Allan, Lord of Galloway."], [261, "B U L When Galloway was an independant state, this was a considerable fortress ; and it seems to have been the favourite residence of John Baliol, sometime King of Scotland. After belonging to the Baliols, the Cummings, and the Douglasses, it appears to have become the property of the Lennoxes, of Caillie. It now belongs, with its precincts, as contained in the Charter, to Mr. Murray, of Broughton, the representative ofthe Caillie Family. Mr. Grose has preserved a vieAv of it. BULEAGRUMUIE, HILL, v. SNIZORT. BULLER'S BUCHAN, inthe District of Ellon, and Shire of Aberdeen : in the Parish of Cruden. This is a small Fishing Village, upon the German Ocean. \" Upon these Rocks {Dun Buy) there was nothing that could long detain attention\", says Dr. Johnson, \" and we soon turned our eyes to Tlie Buller, or Bouilloir of Buchan, which no man can see with indifference, who has either sense of danger, or delight in rarity. It is a Rock perpendicularly tubulated, united on one side with a high shore, and on the other rising steep to a great height, above the main sea. The top is open, from which may be seen a dark gulf of water which flows into the cavity, through a breach made in the lower part ofthe inclosing rock. It has the appearance ofa vast Well bordered with a wall. The edge of The Buller is not wide, and to those that walk round, appears very narrow. He that ventures to look downwards, sees that if his foot should slip, he must fall from his dreadful elevation upon stones on one side, or into the Avater on the other We, however, went round, and were glad when the circuit was completed. When we came down to the sea, Ave saw some boats and rowers, and resolved to explore Tlie Buller, at the bottom. We entered the arch, which the water had made, and found ourselves in a place, which, though we could not think ourselves in danger, we could scarcely survey without some recoil of the mind. The bason in which we floated Avas nearly circular, perhaps thirty yards in diameter. We were inclosed by a natural wall, rising steep on every side to a height which produced the idea of insurmountable confinement, The intercep tion of all lateral light caused a dismal gloom. Round us was a perpendicular rock, above us the distant sky, and below an unknown profundity of water. If I had any malice against a walking spirit, instead of laying him in the Red Sea, I would condemn him to reside in The Buller of Buchan. But terror without danger is only one ofthe sports of fancy, a voluntary agitation of the mind that is permitted no longer than it pleases. We were soon at leisure to examine the place with minute inspection, and found many cavities which, as the watermen"], [262, "BUR told us, Avent backward to a depth which they had never explored. Their extent Ave had not time to try; they are said to serve different purposes. Ladies come hither sometimes in the summer with collations, and smugglers make them store-houses for clandestine merchandise. It is hardly to be doubted but the Pirates of ancient times often used them, as magazines of arms, or repos itories of plunder. To the little Aessels used by the Northern rowers, The Buller may have served as a shelter from storms, and perhaps as a retreat from enemies; the entrance might have been stopped, or guarded with little diffi culty, and though the vessels that were stationed Avithin would have been battered Avith stones showered on them from above, yet the crews AA'ould have lain safe in the Caverns.\" \u2014 BUNAWE, in the District of Lorn, and Shire of Argyle; and in the Parish of Muckairn. It is 113 m. W. b. N. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. It is an improving Village, situate at the confluence of the river Awe Avith Loch Etive. Here The Lorn Furnace Company, established in 1753, have erected their extensive iron manufactories ; there is also a consider able Salmon fishing ; and a Quay is built on a secure and well sheltered Bay, for vessels of small burden, which resort occasionally to Liverpool, Whitehaven, Ulverston, and other places on the Western Coast, loaded Avith pig-iron, tan ner's bark, kelp, and salmon; and import in return, iron-ore, meal, coals, tanned leather, stone-ware, and other articles of commerce. BUQUOY, v. BIRSA. BURGH HEAD, v. WHITEHORN. BURG H-HEAD, in the Shire of Elgin ; and in the Parish of Duffus. This is an improving Village, situate upon a Bay to Avhich it gives name on the Moray Firth, and at the distance of eight miles North-West from Elgin. More than tAvo-thirds ofthe Inhabitants are engaged in nautical affairs, and the remainder are employed upon the free-stone, and lime-stone, Quarries. It is the property of Sir Archibald Dunbar, Bart., of Thunderton: but the Magistrates of Elgin have a servitude over the Fishery, by which, all the fish taken, must be carried to Elgin market for sale. It is also within the Jurisdiction of the Custom- House of Inverness, at the very inconvenient distance of 40 miles. Upon the Promontory of Burgh Head is the Ptoroton, of Richard of Cirencester, and Alata Castra, of Ptolomey : the remains of this remarkable Roman Station are pretty entire, and cov*er an extent of more than eleven acres English : in the reio*n of Malcolm the Second, it was seized by the Danes : by a recent excavation,."], [263, "BUR Avithin its limits, a Roman bath has been discovered ; and, on the 11th of May, 1809, Anthony Carlisle, F. R. S., the distinguished Surgeon, of Soho Square, London (and who, to a perfect knowledge of his Profession, adds every amiable quality of the mind, and ardour of observation), exhibited to The Society of Antiquaries of London, a drawing of a Bull, taken from a stone found here, obviously of Roman sculpture, and where there are many others of the same description ; an engraving of it is given in the Sixteenth Volume of Arch\u00e6ologia, p. 365. General Roy has preserved a plan and sections ofthis Station, pi. 33. By a Memorial presented to The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges by the Proprietors of Burgh-Head, on the 15th of December 1806, it appears, that the Memorialists in the Month of May 1806, \" gave in a represen tation to a Committee of The Honourable House of Commons, stating the great expense and out-lay which they were incurring, in building a Harbour at Burgh- Head, and making roads thereto, for the benefit, not only ofthe District in Avhich it is situate, but the general commerce ofthe Nation at large ; and craving, that they might obtain a part ofthe money arising from the Forfeited Estates, to aid them in a measure so truly patriotic, but expensive. The Honourable Com mittee, after duly appreciating the nature ofthe Undertaking, recommended in their proceedings, that the sum of \u00a32000. should be granted to the Proprietors of Burgh-Head, and they find that it now rests with The Honourable Commis sioners for Roads and Bridges in the Highlands of Scotland to fulfil the wish of the Committee. The Proprietors, while they cannot doubt but The Honourable Commissioners will fulfil the intentions ofthis respectable and Honourable Com mittee, beg leave briefly to state in what manner Burgh-Head Harbour is materially connected with The Caledonian Canal, and other channels leading to Roads and Bridges in the Highlands of Scotland ; and, without so much as O o * \u2022** wishing to detract from the merits of those who look for similar aid, they shall endeavour to show, why, of all other sums recommended by the Committee, this is the most essential to the prosperity ofthe Highlands. It is a well known fact, that, at present, there is not a single Harbour from Peterhead to Inverness (Cromarty excepted), which admits of vessels of One Hundred Tons burden, even at Spring tides. That, in the Moray Firth, the prevailing winds are West, North-West, and Northerly, and when such blow with any degree of violence, it is impossible for vessels to gain Cromarty Bay; nay, many are often driven down the Firth after reaching Fort George, much to the annoyance of trade and the lives of Seamen. If this, as can be well established, is now the case, how"], [264, "BUR much more disastrous must it be, when the vast communication from the East and West Seas by The Caledonian Canal is opened, as well as from Cromarty and Tain Firths to the interior Highlands by Roads and Bridges. Burgh-Head Harbour, situate about 18 miles East from Cromarty, and on the South side of the Moray Firth, Avith 16 feet Avater at least, fit to contain 50 vessels, and which may be taken Avith every wind that Uoavs, holds forth the greatest safety, and undoubtedly deseives the utmost support of The Honourable Commissioners for Roads and Bridges ; for Avithout it, a material link in the chain is lost. Vessels bound for the Caledonian Canal, and the Firths of Cromarty and Tain, will, to a certainty, stand in want of shelter, and find it at Burgh-Head, during the Spring, Autumn, and Winter months, Avhile, at all times, strangers fre quenting this tract Avill there take Pilots on board.\" In their Fourth Report, of April 1809, The Commissioners observe, \" in answer to our Circular Letter of April 1808, the Proprietors informed us, that in reliance on public assistance to the amount of \u00a32000., as recommended in the Report of 1806 from the Com mittee on the Funds of the Forfeited Estates in Scotland, they had ventured to increase their expenditure, which now amounted to nearly \u00a39000. ; but, out of this sum, \u00a33000. being the original purchase money of land and houses, was to be deducted. Six Thousands pounds therefore had been expended on the Harbour, and \u00a32000. appeared to be necessary for completing it, and for making proper roads of access in the immediate vicinity. This application, and indeed most ofthe others respecting Harbours, must haA*e been at once rejected if we had adhered to our usual rule of giA'ing no retrospective assistance, as in the case of roads and bridges; but the reliance Avhich had been placed on the Report of 1806 above mentioned, seemed to render it inequitable to insist upon that sort of objection. It moreover appeared upon enquiry, that the Proprietors had an intention of re-imbursing themsehes by procuring an Act of Parliament, or other Authority, to levy Shore-dues or Tolls on the Shipping frequenting their Harbour, and upon this We represented to them the impossibility of considering any sum so to be repaid, as a contribution to meet the aid proposed to be given by the Harbour Act. Willing, however, to afford effectual assistance towards the completion of a Harbour, Avhich appeared to be the only one on the South Coast of the Murray Firth likely to afford occasional shelter for vessels, thouo-h not those of the largest dimensions, which may hereafer frequent the Cale donian Canal, We made a proposal to the Proprietors, to consider the whole expense as \u00a38000., and to give \u00a32000. towards it, upon condition that on thus"], [265, "BUR paying a fourth part, one-half of the Revenue arising from any shore-dues or tolls, should be appropriated to deepening* and further improving the Harbour ; and this upon the same principle and in the same proportion which We neces sarily insisted upon in other instances, wherein, by paying one-half of the expense, We caused the whole shore-dues or tolls to be appropriated to the improvement of the Harbours assisted to that extent. The Proprietors of Burgh-Head accepted our proposal, and entered into an obligation to that effect ; undertaking also to complete the Harbour and Roads before the commencement of the present year (1809) ; and having been recently informed, that this has been accord ingly effected, We have directed Mr. Telford to make and report a final in spection of the whole Work. By means of this Harbour, a regular Packet or Trader, passing between Burgh-Head and The Little Ferry near Dunrobin, has already been established, and promises much advantage by facilitating the in tercourse ofthe several Counties bordering on the Murray Firth.\" \u2014 In their Fifth Report of April 1811, The Commissioners state \"The new Harbour at Burgh-Head consists of a Bason about 200 yards long and 50 yards wide, the entrance fronting Westward, or towards Cromarty, from whence it is distant about six leagues. This Bason or artificial Harbour was com pleted in the Summer of 1809, and has been found very useful, especially as a Station for Passage vessels which keep up a communication Avith the The Little Ferry in Sutherland, distant about nine leagues : But, We are sorry to learn, that the Bason at Burgh-Head is not found to promise a result so beneficial as was reasonably expected by the enterprising Pro prietors, the sand haA'ing accumulated in an alarming manner at the entrance of the Harbour, and the usual expedient of retaining water for washing it away being impracticable in the present state of the Harbour, because the walls, as not being built of regular Masonry from the bottom, are not water tight ; so that We fear perpetual labour would be required to keep the entrance open to the intended depth, or an inner Bason must be constructed for retain ing a sufficient quantity of Avater to produce this effect. At present the Bar of sand being dry at Low-water, the rise of tide in the Murray Firth, which is from 8 to 12 feet, determines the high-water depth of the entrance. We shall have great pleasure, if in our next Report Ave shall be enabled to speak ofthis Har bour more faA-ourably ; at present, however, it is sufficient for the export of grain, and if this shall continue to be practicable, the cost of the Bason will have been expended usefully for the Public, and, We hope, not unprofitably vol. i. D d"], [266, "BUR to the Proprietors.\" \u2014 Still pursuing the object of general good, it may not be improper to add, that, by a Memorial of the Most Noble The Marquis of Stafford, for himself and other Proprietors on the North side of the Moray Firth, and of George Macpherson Grant, Esq., of Ballendalloch, for himself and other Proprietors on the South side of the said Firth, dated the 12th of April, 1810, it appears, \" That there is an extensive and populous District of country lh the Highlands of Scotland, situate partly in the Shires of Aberdeen and Banff, and partly in the Shire of Elgin, which has no direct communication with the neighbouring Districts or with the nearest Sea- Ports, although, from its peculiar situation, a road through it would open a communication of general use and utility. It is situate on the banks of the Avon and of the Spey, where the Avon joins that river. The Memorialists submit to The Commissioners the propriety of giving this District a communication with the County of Elgin, and with the Sea-port of Burgh-Head in that County, by a road from Tomintoul down the Avon to its confluence with the Spey, by a Rope ferry across the Spey, such as that at Renfrew on the Clyde, by a continuation of the road through what is called The Mannoch Hill, to the water of Lossie, and from thence past The Knock of Alves to Burgh-Head, a distance of about 30 miles. A glance at the Map of Scotland must convince The Commissioners ofthe great utility of this measure, and of its close connection with the other Improvements under their charge. At Tomintoul the proposed road will join the great Military road to Brae-Mar, and reach the Dunrobin road by means of the Packets at Burgh- Head, and this cham of connection would, during nine months ofthe year, form the shortest and best passage between the Northern and Southern extremities ofthe Island. The people of Orkney and Caithness, of part of Ross, and of Sutherland, come by the Dunrobin road to The Little Ferry in Sutherland : From this, in place of crossing the four Ferries to Inverness as formerly, they take Packet at once to Burgh-Head in the County of Elgin; but, when arrived there, they must at present go Eastward towards Aberdeen, or West towards Inver- ness, to fall into the great roads leading from these Towns to the South. In like manner, a traveller from the South, when he reaches Perth, must turn West to Dunkeld, or East towards Aberdeen, in place of pushing straight through The Spital of Glen-Shee to Brae-Mar, to the road now submitted to The Commis- sioners for consideration, and through Burgh-Head to the North Coast. Edin- burgh, Perth, Brae-Mar, Tomintoul, Burgh-Head, and Dunrobin, are nearly in a direct line with each other ; and, during the greater extent of that part of"], [267, "BUR the line which is in the Highlands, there are a succession of Glens running South and North along the course suggested. With reference to Public pur- poses, the proposed communication is most desirable, whether it regards the speedy transmission of intelligence from the Northern extremity of the country to the Capital, or for the certain conveyance of troops with celerity from South to North. The measure, connected as it is with the Dunrobin road, and the Packets to Burgh-Head, and with the roads already made through Brae-Mar, will give to the Avhole Inhabitants from Cape Wrath Southwards direct com- munication to the Capital.\" \u2014 The Commissioners observe \" the utility ofthis proposal to a considerable District of country is so evident, that We have caused a Survey and Estimate to be made, and it has very recently been transmitted to us ; but, We shall not think ourselves justified in undertaking this part of the communication from Burgh-Head Southward, unless We shall be also enabled to improve the Military road between Tomintoul and Brae-Mar, from whence there is at present a direct carriage road to Perth and Edinburgh ; but, for this purpose, it is manifest that the active co-operation ofthe principal Pro- prietors in that part ofthe Shire of Aberdeen is indispensable.\" \u2014 The extent of this proposed road is 39 miles by measurement.

BURNT-ISLAND, originally KINGHORN, WESTER, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the District of Kirkaldy, and Shire of Fife : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 2 chalders of barley, 2 chalders of oats, \u00a360. in money, and \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion ele ments : the manse is in good repair : the glebe consists of 4 acres : Patron, The CroAvn : The Church was re-built about a Century ago, in an elegant manner. It is in the Presbytery of Kirkaldy, and Synod of Fife. The Resident Popula tion ofthis Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 1530, and, in 1811, was 1934. It Dd2"], [268, "BUR is 9 m, N. from Edinburgh. It is pleasantly situate on the Northern bank ofthe Firth of Forth, upon a Peninsula surrounded by hills towards the North, in the form of an amphitheatre. It was constituted a Royal Borough by James the Sixth, and is one ofthe Contributary Royal Boroughs with Kinghorn, in send- ing one Member to Parliament. The Government is A*ested in 7 Trades-Coun- sellors, and 14 Guild-Counsellors, from whom three are chosen to be Baillies : there is also a Provost elected annually at Michaelmas, who, if he is a Nobleman, isa Supernumerary; but, if a Burgher, he is included in the 21 Counsellors. The Harbour is easily entered, is very capacious and of great depth of water, and affords perfect security, let the Avind blow from any quarter. Ship-building, for which this port is peculiarly adapted, is now carried on, and might be in- creased to any extent ; of late years, a dry dock fit for the reception of a Frigate of 40 guns has been formed at the East Point ofthe peninsula, within the Har- bour, by a private individual, Mr. J. Fernie, which is of infinite importance in the Firth. There is a regular Ferry from hence to Leith, at full and half tide, which is 6 miles distant. The old Castle, built by the Duries, commanded both the toAvn and harbour. The place has a natural strength, which, with the conveniency of the Port opposite to the Metropolis, made it, during the troubles of 1560, a most desirable post ; The French, allies of the Queen Regent, forti- fied it strongly: In the month of October, 1715, it was surprised, and possessed by the Rebels under the Earl of Marr, who here formed the bold design of pass- ing over a body of troops to the opposite shore ; and Avhich was in part executed under the conduct of Brigadier Macintosh, of Bor lam, notwithstanding all the efforts of the Ships of War. The Parish of Burnt-Island forms a square of nearly 3 miles in extent : along the Coast, it is flat, and fertile ; but, towards the North, the surface becomes hilly and mountainous, and of inferior quality. The climate is very salubrious. Cockles are in great abundance ; and there is also a bed of excellent oysters, which belongs partly to the Borough, and partly to The Earl of Morton. On the estate of Grange, is a fine Quarry of free-stone, and a species of marble which admits a very high polish: there are also inexhaustible Quarries of lime-stone. Upon the summit of Dunearn Hill, are the vestiges of a Roman encampment, called Agricola's camp, where many Roman medals have been discovered. A General Post-Office is estab lished here. According to tradition, Burnt-Island derives its name from the burning of a few Fishermens' huts, upon a small Island on the West side ofthe Harbour, which induced them to take up their residence, where the town now"], [269, "B U-R stands. Forseveralyears past, herrings inthe greatest abundance have appear ed as far Up the Firth as Bsrnt-Lland, Avhich has occasioned a great increase of population, and erections for the curing of them. Mr. Pitcairn has a vitriol work 4iere. In 1690, Burnt-Island gave the title of Baron to the family of Wemyss, hoav extinct or dormant. BURRAY, ISLE, one ofthe Orkneys : formerly a Vicarage, united to the ancient Vicarage of South R3naldsay : The Church is out of repair. It is in the Presbytery of Kirkwall, and Synod of Orkney. Divine Service is performed here every third Sunday. This is a low Island, about four miles long, and one mile broad : the soil is in general a light dry sand, mixed in a few places Avith some coarse clay: it is the sole property of Thomas Lord Dundas. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 271, and, in 1811, was 212. It is sepa rated from South Ronaldsay by Water Sound, a Ferry of a mile broad. The Post goes Aveekly through this Island, but no road has yet been made. It abounds with rabbits. Here is a Water-mill, but the Island is so dry, that it is seldom able to grind much ofthe sub-tenants' grain ; which is performed at a distance, where they not only pay multure, but also at their own mill, where they cannot grind. This Island is composed of sandstone, sandstone flag, and shistose clay. The shistose clay, according to Mr. Jameson, is ofa black colour, and has frequently interspersed bitumen ; and veins ofcalcarious spar are to be observed traversing it. This is a favourable appearance for coal, and deserves to be tried. BURRAY, ISLE, one of the Shetland Isles ; formerly a Vicarage, consti tuting part ofthe Union of Bressay, from which it is distant 10 English miles : The Church is very ancient, and has a large Steeple, but it is in bad repajr ; the Register is in great disorder. It is in the Presbytery of Shetland, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population ofthis Island, and ofthe Islands of House, Haveray, and Papa, in 1801, was 407, and, in 1811, was 430. The Islands of Burray and House are situate on the West side of the Mainland, and are sepa rated from it by a narrow Sound, called Cliff Sound \u25a0 they lie so near to each other, that there is a communication between them by a Bridge : they are about four miles in length, and nearly one mile in breadth. The Islands of Burray and HaA'eray contain 241 merks ofland, besides outsets, Avhich are not included in the Rentals. In Burray, HaA'eray, and Papa, they have 28 Fishing boats ofa moderate size, Avhich are fitted out at a small expense : the fishermen set their lines in the evening, and draw them in the morning : and their Avinter fishings have been sometimes known to exceed those of the summer. Upon this cOast is an extensive Oyster scalp, from whence large quantities of Oysters, of a fine"], [270, "BUT flavour, are annually taken. The soil of Burray is various ; in somo places it is sandy, in others a fine black earth : in good years, it produces grain sufficient for the consumption ofthe inhabitants: they manage their Hay crop in a very absurd manner. The Poor of Burray and Quarts have the Interest of \u00a320. Sterling, and the rent of 8 merks of land, mortified by The Rev William Humphrey, formerly Minister of these Parishes. See, Bressay, Isle.

This Island is about 18 mile_- in length, and from 4 to 5 miles in breadth. The Northern parts are rocky and barren ; but the Southern extremity is more fertile, well cultivated, and inclosed: and, in some places, beautifully ornamented with wood. This Island, in con- junction with the Islands of Arran, Great and Little Cumbray, and Inch- Marnoc, form a County under the name of The Shire of Bute. This Shire, and that of Caithness, send a Member to Parliament alternately. The coast is rocky, but indented with several safe Harbours, from which are annually fitted out a number of Busses for the Herring Fishery. The climate, though damp, is mild and temperate, and very healthy. Bute gives the title of Earl, and of Marquis in England, so created in 1796, to a branch of the Ancient and Illustrious Family of Stuart, who is Proprietor of the greatest Part of the Island. The Marquis is Admiral ofthe Shire, by virtue of a Commission from His Majesty, and is no way dependent on the Lord High Admiral of Scotland : so that in any maritime case (even as in so high a crime as murder, or piracy), that occurs within this Jurisdiction, his Lordship is sufficient Judge, or may delegate his authority to Deputies. Civil causes are determined here as in other Counties of this part ofthe Kingdom, by the Sheriff-Depute, who is always resident, and Avho is also the Judge in smaller offences. Justices of the Peace have the same powers here, and over the whole comity as in other places. Criminals are lodged in the County Gaol at Rotbesay, but are removed for trial to Inverary ; where the Judges ofthe Court of Justiciary meet tAvice a year, for the deter- mining of criminal causes of a certain District. As Bute lies contiguous to the richest and most populous districts in the West of Scotland (being about 6 miles distant from the coast of Ayr, and divided only by a narrow channel of half a mile from Cowal, which is, in some places, 16 fathoms deep), its exports are conveyed thither, and its imports received from thence : and the prices of all"], [271, "CAB things in this Isle are regulated by the prices paid or received at Greenock or Largs on the Mainland. There is abundance of free-stone, and lime-stone * but coal has not yet been discovered. The Island of Bute contains the two Parishes of Kingorth, and Rothesay, a description of each of which is given separately. See, Kill-Modan. BUTTERDEAN, in the Shire of Berwick: and in the Parish of Oldham stocks. A village, at the distance of 6 miles W. b. N. from Press. See, Old hamstocks.

The Barony of Byres has always been esteemed one of the finest estates of its extent in this County ; it belonged for many Centuries to a Noble Family of the name of Lindsay, ancestors to the present Earl of Crawford, from whom it was acquired about the beginning ofthe Seventeenth Century by The Earl of Hading ton,'and is now the property of The Earl of Hopeton. It is 3 m. N. N. W. from Hadington. The Earl of Hadington is Baron of Binning and Byres. BYTH, v. NEW BYTH. c.

The surface is very uneven ; and, from the inclemency of the win ters, the soil is principally appropriated to pasture : the climate in summer, however, is very pleasant, and it is much resorted to by invalids for the benefit of drinking goat's milk. Limestone, and light grey slates, are in great abundance. The Forests of Glen Fiddich, and Black- Water, are stored with red deer, and roes ; and the moors abound Avith grouse, black cocks, and other kinds of game. Here are inexhaustible peat-mosses. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with a rood of laud. Services of all kinds have happily been abolished here by the liberality of The Duke of Gordon. C ADBOLL, in the Shire Cromarty, though locally situate in the Shire of Ross ; and in the Parish of Fearn. It is 8 m. E. S. E. from Tain. It is situate on the Moray Firth, and, in the rocky part ofthe Coast, is a remarkably good free-stone Quarry. This Estate belongs to the ancient and respectable family of Macleod.

Sterling in money, 236 stone of meal, 88 pecks of bear, the Tythes of Townhead and Byres, Avhich are paid in kind, and the Teind offish, which is one shilling from every person who uses the haaf-net: the manse was built about the year 1708, by Dr. John Hutton : the glebe con sists of 21 acres: Patron, The Marquis of Qusjsnsberry : The Church is in decent condition. It is iu the Presbytery of Dumfries, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Villages of Keltown, and Glencaple) was 1014, and, in 1811, Avas 1170. It is 6^ m. S. S. E. from Dumfries. This Parish contains about 4640 Scotch acres, and is a kind of Peninsula, formed by the rivers Nith, and Lochar, and the Solway Firth. The middle, and Western parts, are hilly ; but, towards the East, the surface becomes low and level : the greater part of the arable ground is inclosed, and Avell cultivated. The whole of the Parish is situate on a bed of red free stone, Avhich is quarried in many places. The Nith, and Lochar, abound with"], [273, "C A E fish. This Parish is the sole property of William Haggerstone MaXavell Constable, Esq., of Nithsdale, except about 600 acres, which belong to three different Heritors. Peats are abundant. In 1708, John Hutton, M. D., a native ofthis Parish, who was first Physician to King William and Queen Mary, and Physician General to their armies and hospitals, in which stations he honour ably acquired an ample fortune, most liberally mortified \u00a31000. Sterling : the Interest of \u00a3900. of which was destined for support of the native poor of the Parish, the payment ofthe Schoolmasters of Bankend, Blackshaw, High Mains, and Keltown, maintaining six Bursars at the Grammar School at Bankend, and repairing the Church, and manse: the Interest of the remaining \u00a3100. was al lotted to defray the expense of management ; which, by the deed of mortification, is entrusted to the Kirk-Session, whose Accompts are to be annually audited by the Presbytery of the bounds. The whole sum of \u00a31000. was, soon after it came into the hands of the Session, laid out in the purchase of the Barony of Barclay, in the Parish of Colvend. The Parisii afterwards received \u00a3310. more, in dona tions from different persons : \u00a3 1 10. of which was laid out to improve the estate of Barclay, and the remaining \u00a3200. is lent on Interest at 5 per cent. Dr. Hutton died in 1712; and, besides the above benefaction, he bequeathed his Library to the Presbytery of Dumfries, which Town he represented in Parliament. The site and foundations of the original Castle of Caerlaverock are still very conspi cuous, and easy to be traced out in a Wood about 300 yards to the South- East of the present building : from these foundations it appears to haA'e been some what less than the present Castle, but ofa similar figure, and to have been sur rounded by a double ditch: Its form and situation are particularly described in an ancient Heraldic French poem, preserved in The British Museum, reciting the names and armorial bearings of the Knights and Barons who accompanied King Edward the First in his inroad into Scotland, by the Western Marches, in the year 1300, when this Castle Avas attacked, and taken: and it appears from the authority of the Wardrobe Account of the Twenty-eighth year of that Mon arch, published by The Society of Antiquaries of London, that His Majesty was here for several days in the months of July, August, and November, of the year 1300. The Old Castle of Caerlaverock is said to have been originally founded in the Sixth Century by Llyuarch Og : It Avas the chief seat of the An cient and Illustrious family of Maxwell, in the days of King Malcolm Canmore, as appears from an ancient pedigree of that family, in the possession of the Riddells, of Glen Riddle; wherein Eugene Maxwell, of Caerlaverock, is said vol. i. E e"], [274, "C A I to have been at the siege of Alnwick with that King, in the Twenty-sixth year of his reign, A. D. 1097: and it continued in that great Family, until it passed by an heiress, Lady Winifred Maxwell, in marriage to Hagerston Constable, Esq., in whose respectable Family it now remains. The precise time when the New or present Castle was built, is not ascertained, but it must have been before the year 1425: for, in that year, Murdoc, Duke of Albany, was confined in the great Round tower, Avhich still retains his name. In 1570, it again experienced the miseries of war, being then ruined by The Earl of Sussex, who was sent with an English army to support King James the Sixth, after the murder of the Re gent. The fortifications of this Place were, it is said, once more reinstated by Robert, the first Earl of Nithsdale, in the year 1638: and, during the unhappy troubles under Charles the First, its owner nobly supported the cause of Royalty, in which he expended his whole fortune; nor did he lay down his arms, until he received the King's Letters, in 1640, directing and authorising him to deliver up the Castles of Thrieve and Caerlaverock, on the best terms that he could obtain. Mr. Grose has preserved three Views of it. Not far West from the Castle, is the Wardlaw Hill; on the summit of which are still visible the vestiges ofa Roman Station, which is conjectured to be the Uxella of Richard of Cirencester.

The Coast is rocky, and remarkable for a number of Bays and Promontories. The Resident Population ofthis Shire, in 1801, was 22,609, and, in 1811, was 23,419. It sends one Member to Parliament. Caith ness gives the title of Earl to the Ancient and Noble family of Sinclair, one of the Sixteen Peers for North Britain, in the Imperial Parliament, and Lord Lieu tenant ofthe Shire.

There was also a Chapel of Ease at Old Calder: and, aiDallas in the Streins, was a Free Chapel, with a Glebe, and a proper Stipend. In 1650, a part ofthe Parish of Auldearn was disjoined, and annexed to the East end of the Parish of Calder. This Parish, from a Survey made in 1782, contains 26,000 acres ; of which, 18,000 acres are moor and moss. The lower part ofthe Parish is flat; the higher part is hilly and mountainous. The soil ofthe arable part is thin and sharp, but fertile : a part ofthe low lands is liable to be overflowed by the burn of Calder, and the water of Nairn; be sides these, the rapid river of Findhorn runs through the higher part of the Par ish ; and both of them abound Avith salmon, and trout. The Schoolmaster's salary is 300 merks, together with School fees, and perquisites. The air is remarkably salubrious. It is well furnished with fuel. As to personal services, they are almost in disuse; being only preserved on a small estate, and a wadset holden by a Gentleman in the Parish. The Roads are in a tolerable state, being kept in repair by the statute-labour, which is exacted in kind. The Bridges are in good order, being so kept by Government, as the Military Road passes through the Parish. The Erse, and English or Scottish Languages are equally spoken here. At a short distance to the Eastward ofthe Church, is the House of Calder, a Seat of The Right Honourable Lord Cawdor. The Thanes of Calder, as Constables of the King's House, resided in the Castle of Nairn, and had a Coun try seat at what is is now called Old Calder, half a mile North from the present seat: there they had a House on a small moat, with a dry ditch, and a draw bridge, the vestiges Avhereof still remain: But, by a Royal Licence, dated 6th of August 1454, they built the present Tower of Calder; which, surrounded Avith spacious inclosures, a large wood, and a picturesque burn, make a grand and delightful Seat. It now gives the Irish title of Baron to the Ancient and Noble family of Campbell. From this castle, Macbeth drew his second title.

This Parish is about 13 miles in length, and between 3 and 4 miles in breadth, stretching along the Southern bank of the riA*er Kelvin. Tlie soil is various ; and great improvements in agriculture have lately been made here. The Great Canal runs through the Parish for about 5 miles, and is supplied from a Lake, called Tlte Bishop's Loch, which is a mile in length, and a quarter ofa mile in breadth. Tlie Public roads are in good repair. Free-stone, and limestone, are in vast abundance. Peats are in plenty. The whole ofthis Parish, except the Barony of Calder, and the Mid- Town of Bedlay, formerly belonged to the Sub-deanery of Glasgow. The Bishop's land was called The Baldermonoch Ward, or Monk's Town, and com- prehends ten Townships ; each of which contains 8 ploughgates of land ; the Mill of Bedlay is still the joint property of these ten ToAvnships. Aster the Reformation, the Temporalities ofthe Sub-deanery of Glasgow, which consisted of the Parishes of Calder, and Monkland (now divided into Monkland East, and West), together with the Patronage of these Churches, came into the possession ofthe Noble families of Hamilton and Killmarnock, and were by them trans- ferred to The College of Glasgow, for a considerable sum of money, about the year 1656. The Parish of Calder, as well as that of Monkland, availing itself ofthe Act of Parliament in 1690, by paying 600 merks Scotch, as directed inthe Act, to The College of Glasgow, obtained a renunciation ofthe right of Patronage by that Learned Body ; in consequence of which, the Heritors and Elders of the Parish became the Electors ofthe Minister. There are Schools at Auchen-Loch, Auchenairn, and Chrystone, each of which have small Salaries annexed to them : the Salary ofthe Parochial School being 300 merks Scotch, together with School fees, and some small perquisites. The Roman wall, called Graham's Dyke, may still be traced for about four miles through the Parish, and one of the Watch-Towers is also very distinct.

CALDER, EAST, or CALDER CLERE, in the Shire of Edinburgh : an ancient Rectory, united in 1750 to the Rectory of Kirk-Newton : Patron, The Earl of Morton : The Church, Avhich is now demolished, Avas dedicated to St. Cuthbert. The Manor of Calder was by Malcolm the Fourth granted to Randulph de Clere ; and from him, it became known by the name of Calder Clere, to distinguish it from Calder Comitis, the adjoining* Manor. The Barony of Calder Clere was forfeited, during the succession war ; and was granted in 1306, by Robert the First to James Douglas, of Lothian, the Progenitor ofthe Earls of Morton. Robert the First confirmed this Manor to William Douglas, the heir of James of Lothian. The Earl of Morton takes his title of dignity from the lands of Mortoune, lying in this Parish and belonging to His Lordship, as appears from the minutes ofthe Scotch Parliament, of the 14th of March 1457-8, and from an instrument there referred to, in which are these words : \u2014 \" Tune vero dictus Dominus Cancellarius (Episcopus Brechen), declaravit dictum Dominum de Dalkeith, non intitulari debere in dicto comitatu pro terris de Mor toune, in dominio de Niddisdale existent ; sed pro terris de Mortoune in Calder Cleir jacent.\" After the Reformation, The Earl of Morton, who was now Baron of Calder Clere, acquired the advowson of the Church, and with it the right of the Monks of Kelso to the tenth ofthe multure of the Mill of Calder. In 1541, the Barony of Calder Clere, according to Mr. Chalmers, was confirmed by James the Fifth to James Earl of Morton, who died in 1553, without the ad vowson ofthe Church. In 1564, James, his successor, the well-known Morton, who fell under the axe ofthe LaAv (in 1581,) after committing a thousand crimes, obtained from the Queen, whom he dethroned, a confirmation of all his lands, with the Barony of Calder Clere, and the advowson of the Churches, and Chapels. In 1606, William, Earl of Morton, Avas served heir to his Grand father in his various estates, including the Barony of Calder Clere, with the ad vowson ofthe Churches.

This Parish is about 7 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth : the surface is in general level,- and the soil is tolerably fertile, though light and dry: agriculture is Avell attended to here. The Town is pleasantly situate, and many of the scenes and prospects, which the Wood presents, are romantic, grand, and delightful. The climate is very salubrious. The emoluments of the established Schoolmaster, including a good house and School-room, his legal Salary, the interest of a sum of money which was sunk upon an estate in the neighbourhood for his benefit, together with perquisites and School-fees, amount to upwards of 30 guineas per annum. There are three more Schools in the Parish, but they have no fixed Salaries to support them. There are every Avhere indica tions of coal ; and also plenty of free-stone. On the estate of Letham, the pro perty of Sir W.A. Cunyngham, Bart., is a powerful sulphureous Spring, similar to that at Harrowgate. A little to the West ofthe Town, stands Calder-House, the Seat of the Noble family of Sandilands, Lord Torphichen : the picture of John Knox is hung up in the same hall, where he dispensed the Sacrament ofthe Lord's Supper for the first time in Scotland, after the Reformation. The House of Greenbank, near the village, is celebrated as the Birth-place of John Spottiswood, Archbishop of St. Andrew's ; the house, and garden, and a few acres ofland belonging to it, are now the property of Lord Torphichen.

From the elevation"], [281, "CAL of the ground, being from 450 to 700 feet above the level of the sea, it is cold and moist, and exposed to storms of wind and rain from the South and South- West. Agriculture is beginning to improve here. The greater part of the Parish lies upon coal, which has been dug for in various places, but to little advantage. Limestone is found here in great abundance. The Salary ofthe established Schoolmaster is 300 merks, together with 20s. yearly arising from a mortification, and School-fees. There are also several other Schools in the Parish. In the Southern extremity, is an old Castle, which is said to have been fortified by Oliver Cromwell, to repress the depredations of the Moss troopers : and on the summit of a rising ground, called Castle Graig, are the remains ofa Roman Camp, in a pretty entire state ; and, near it, several Roman coins have been discovered. According to Mr. Chalmers, the present Parishes of Mid Calder and West Calder, Avere of old comprehended in one Parish, and Barony of Calder Comitis. West Calder received this name, as lying Westward ofthe river Calder ; and it was distinguished by the name of Calder Comitis, as early as the Twelfth Century, from The Earl of Fife, who held it : while East Calder was called Calder Clere, from Randulph de Clere, who enjoyed that District. This extensive Manor of Calder Comitis was possessed by The Earls of Fife, as early as the reign of Malcolm the Fourth ; and by them it was en joyed, as low down as the reign of David the Second : it then passed to Sir William Douglas, of Douglas, who gave it in Free Marriage, with Eleanor, his sister, to Sir James de Sandilands, in 1349. This Grant was confirmed by Duncan, The Earl of Fife, and by David the Second. From that Marriage sprung the Family of Sandilands, who acquired the estates of The Knights of St. John, at the Reformation, with the Peerage of Torphichen ; and who still retain the Barony of West Calder, with the Advowson of the Church. Before the Reformation, there was a Chapel, in the upper part of this extensive District, which gave a name to Chapeltown, about a mile East from West Calder : this Chapel remained till the Revolutionary reign of Charles the First. In 1637, John Lord Torphichen was served heir to his father in the Barony of Calder, and to the Patronage of the Church. In 1646, this large Parish was divided into two districts, which were named Mid Calder, and West Calder; the old Church was noAv appropriated to Mid Calder ; while the new Church was erected in the upper District, which has given rise to the Kirk-ToAvn of West Calder : and, Lord Torphichen continued to be the Patron of the Two Parishes,. till he transferred his Advowson of West Calder to The Earl of Lauderdale. vol. i.

This estate came into the family of Maxwell by a marriage of Eumerus de Caerlaveroc, a Cadet of the family of Nithsdale, with Mary, daughter and heiress of Roland de Mernis, in the reign of Alexander the Third. Sir Robert Maxwell, second son of Eumerus, was, in his father's life-time, designed by the title of Calderwood ; and from him the present Sir William Maxavell is lineally descended.

In the East, the spacious Firth of Moray intersects the country as far up as Inverness ; Avhile, upon the West side, Loch Linnhe reaches to Fort William. A great Valley, about 60 miles long, extends between these arms ofthe sea: it is bounded by lofty mountains, and its bottom is covered, except for about 17 miles, Avith deep Lakes. The land between the Lakes is level, and composed entirely of alluvial strata, excepting some rocks to the South-West of Fort Augustus. To save the tedious and dangerous passage by the Pentland Firth, The Caledonian Canal was designed, and which connects the several Lakes.

S. in August, the 9th of October, and the first Thursday, O. S., in December: but the greatest Fairs are holden on the 21st of March, called Fil-ma-Chessaig, or The Festival of St. Kessaig ; and, on the 16th of May, for black cattle, when the Drovers find excellent accommodation, and are relieved by Mr. Drummond, of Perth, from imposts and several inconveniences, which are experienced in other places ; besides various marks of attention, and civility from his frends. A General Post- Office is established here. The Village of Callander is beautifully situate on both sides ofthe Teith, over which there is a large and convenient Bridge : the houses are substantially built, and are covered with slate. A settlement for the soldiers, discharged after the German War, was established here by Government in 1763 : since which time, it has been gradually increasing. The Castle, which was mostly taken down in 1737, is surrounded by a tract of fine land, called Tlie Barony of Callander, which was once the property of the Cal landers, of Callander, and with whom it continued for many ages ; It was forfeited in the reign of James the First or Second, and granted to the Livingstons, who were afterwards created Earls, by that title. About the year 1630, it Avas sold to the Drummonds, of Perth : and, in 1715, the title was attainted : but, in 1784, this part ofthe estate of Perth was restored to the Drummonds, and soon after, the title of Earl also, to that Ancient and Illustrious Family. Fuel is expensive. The Grammar School is deservedly in great repute, and is numerously attended. There is also a Society School. The Parish of Callander is about 16 miles in length, and 10 miles in breadth, stretching along the banks of the river Teith. Towards the West and North, it is mountainous, and covered with heath : but the arable land is mostly inclosed, and capable of high cultivation. The climate is particularly salubrious, Callander is remarkable for the wild and romantic Ff2"], [284, "CAL Scenery of its prospects ; and The Trosachs are often visited by persons of taste, Avho are desirous of seeing nature in her rudest and most unpolished state. Ben- Ledi, the highest mountain, is elevated 3009 feet above the level of the sea. Here are Quarries of excellent lime-stone, and blue slate. Game, of various kinds, are in plenty. The Gaelic language is commonly spoken. The old, superstitious customs of Beltein, on the first of May, and of bonfires on AH Saints Eve, are not only fast wearing aAvay here, but all over the Highlands. From a Memorial presented to The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, in 1807, by the great Land Owners, it appears, \" That a Road from the Muir of Orchil, in the Shire of Perth, to Callander of Monteith, in the said County, Avill prove an essential benefit to that part of the Country, and greatly promote the industry of the inhabitants ; and that branches of the same to the Villages of Muthil and Comrie in the said County, will also be highly advantageous. \u2014 Several Roads have been made at different times from the South to the North of Scotland, both on the East and West sides ofthe Island, but it is no less necessary for rendering the intercourse of the country more perfect, that Roads should be made from East to West, so that communications may be opened across the country. There is not perhaps, in the Avhole Highlands of Scotland, any line of road in that direction Avhich would prove so extensively useful as one from the Muir of Orchil on the East, to Callander of Monteith on the West, passing through Glen Airtney, and having branches of communication with the Villages of Muthil, and Comrie. The communication between these places is at present cut off by immense Mountains, or by Bogs or Mosses, wholly impas sable, except during the summer ; and, although the East end ofthe line at the Muir of Orchil is on the borders of an improved country, and near the seats of Commerce and Industry, and is only 20 miles distant from Callander on the West, yet the intermediate space remains as much unimproved as any of the most remote parts ofthe Kingdom. This neglect does not arise from the bar renness ofthe country, or the want ofthe means of improvement, for there is a very considerable extent on both sides ofthe proposed line of road (not less at an average than half a mile in breadth) capable of high improvement by cultivation, and which might be converted into corn fields, although at present the greatest part of it is occupied by sheep. This improvement, however, can only be effected by means ofthe proposed Road, by which coals Avould be procured from the Collieries near Stirling, by a Road which passes from thence to Crieff and Perth, through the said Muir of Orchil, with which it is meant that the Road proposed should communicate: and there is abundance of lime on the line of road itself"], [285, "CAL in three different situations, one of Avhich is situate at Dalclathie in Glen Airtney, about the centre of the road, and from which all the other parts of it might re ceive a supply. There is also at the same place a Slate Quarry, of excellent quality, but from which the country at present derives no benefit, from Avant of communication. \u2014 At this time, when the demand for sheep from the more Northern parts of the country is on the decline, and even a supply from that quarter may soon be expected in the Market, it is peculiarly desirable to pro cure the means of introducing into an extensive district a mixed species of hus bandry, which Avill afford maintenance and employment to a very increased Population, and will produce a greater abundance ofthe necessaries of life. But, besides the improvement ofthe country itself through which the road passes, it will be productive of other benefits to the neighbouring country, by opening a communication between two Districts in an advancing state of improvement, and which have natural Avants to be supplied. The facility of communication between Callander, which is situate at the entrance into the Central Highlands, and the villages of Comrie, Muthil, and the surrounding country, will give an accession of industry to all these places, and the more Northern inhabitants, who forsake their own country for want of employment, will be attracted to these places by the employment and the settlements Avhich they afford. The proposed line of road, therefore, is deserving the attention of the Commissioners, and the Sub scribers hereunto, the Proprietors of lands through Avhich the Road passes, and others who are well-wishers of an undertaking promising so much general benefit to the country, are Avilling, in the event of the road being approved of by the Board, in terms ofthe late Act of Parliament, to pay, or secure to be paid, one half of the expense of making the said road, and bridges that may be necessary thereon, and also to find security, that they will further bear and defray all such further sum or sums of money beyond such estimated expense, as shall be neces sary to make and complete the said Road and Bridges.\" \u2014 This line of road extends 25\\ miles, and The Commissioners accordingly directed the necessary inquiries to be made by Mr. Telford, their engineer ; but it does not appear to have been carried into effect. CALLANDER, in the Shire of Stirling ; and inthe Parish of Falkirk. It is _f m. S. E. from Falkirk. The estate of Callander having been confiscated immediately after the commotion in 1715, it was sold about the year 1720; and such Tythes as were not conveyed with the Estate, were disposed of by The Commissioners and Trusteees of the Forfeited estates in Scotland, to Mr."], [286, "CAL Hamilton, of Dichmond, under this express stipulation, that they should be sub ject to the Stipend ofa Minister for the new Parish (Polmont), which Avas to be erected out ofthe Parish of Falkirk. The numerous fine trees in this Park, toge ther Avith the adjacent Avoods, add much to the pleasantness of the Neighbour hood. Callander formerly gave the title of Earl to the Family of Livingstone, attainted in 1715. On the forfeiture ofthe Estates ofthe Family of Linlithgoav and Callander, they were purchased by The Company which undertook to raise Avater from the river Thames into the York Buildings, for supplying a part ofthe city of London. The affairs of that Company having gone into disorder, their Avhole estates Avere sold for the benefit of their Creditors by the Authority of the Court of Session ; and those of Callander, and Almond, were bought by William Forbes, Esq., the present Avorthy proprietor. The Estates, together with some other Farms which were purchased by this Gentleman, amounted to about 8000 Scotch acres: Mr. Forbes has made the most judicious and beneficial improve ments in this extensive property; almost the whole of these Estates is now inclosed, and sub-divided , and laid down with grass-seeds : and it is a distinguishing feature and a prominent mark of his good sense, that all his improvements are invariably completed, before he lets the land on long leases. Callander House has been the scene of important events; and it Avas stormed, and taken by Oliver Crom well, on his march to the Torr-Wood to give battle to Charles the Second. Nearly opposite to this House, an earthen Wall of considerable height and thickness branches off from Graham's Dyke, runs through the garden of West- Quarter House, and reaches the old Castle of Almond. From thence towards the East, there are few or no certain traces of it to be seen; but it may be pre sumed, that it once ended at Linlithgow, where there was a Roman Camp, on the very place where the King's Palace was afterwards built. This Wall has no fosse, and being broad at the top, was probably intended to be a Road, as well as a line of defence. CALLENDAR, within the Jurisdiction ofthe City of Glasgow, and Shire of Lanark : in the Barony Parish. This is a populous Village. CALLIGRAY, v. KILLIGRAY. CALLWATTIE, BAY, v. ROSSNEATH. CALLY, v. GIRTHON. CALLY, in the Shire of Perth; and in the Parish of Bendothy. This is a detached Estate, situate in the angle of confluence between the and Ardle, being 7 miles distant from the Parish Church. It formerly belonged to the"], [287, "CAM Monks of Cupar cf Angus, and was from that circumstance, called Monks' Catty. It is now in the possession of Mr. Macdonald. Here is a Burial-ground : and also a Bridge, of one arch, over the Ardle. CALTON, within the Jurisdiction of the City of Glasgow, and Shire of Lanark : in the Barony Parish. This is a populous, manufacturing Village. Here is a Charity School, supported by Mr. David Dale, with an annual Salary of \u00a315. : there are also tAvo Sunday Schools. CALTON HILL, v. LEITH, SOUTH. CAMBO HOUSE, v. KINGS-BARNS. CAMBRAY, v. CUMBRAY, GREAT, and LITTLE. C AMBUS, in the Shire of Clackmannan; and in the Parish of Alloa. It is 2j m. W b. N. from Alloa. It is situate on the Eastern bank ofthe river Devon, near its confluence with the Forth; and sloops and large boats, loaded with grain, come up near to the Village, to supply the Mills, and a Brewery; and to carry off the manufactures of both of them. On the Western side ofthe Devon, is a rich flat piece of ground, called West Cambus, belonging to Lord Alva *. it consists of 160 acres ofland, which are let in two Farms, on one of which is the Corn mill; the Tenants pay kain, cess, and schoolmaster's salary, over and above their rent. The lands of Bandeath, Kersie, and part of Tlie Frosk, which all lie on the South side of the Forth, are bound and thirled to the Mill of West Cambus. The lands of East Cambus run along the banks of the Devon, until they meet with the Upper Barony of Tullibody. The Creek of Cambus is within the District of the Port of Alloa. C AMBUS-KENNETH, v. LOGIE. C AMBUS-LANG, anciently DRUMSARGARD, in the Middle Ward, and Shire of Lanark: formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, before the late augmentation, was 118 bolls 12 pecks of oatmeal, \u00a330. in money, and \u00a38..6..8. for Communion elements : the manse was built in 1756*. the glebe consists of 4| acres: Patron, The Duke of Hamilton, who is also Titular of the Teinds: The Church, which is a neat plain edifice, Avas re-built in 1743. This Parish was first a Rectory, and then a Prebend. John Cameron, of the family of Loch- Eil, was Rector, Avhen he Avas promoted to the Bishoprick of Glasgow. In 1429, Bishop Cameron, at the desire ofthe Patron, Archibald Earl of Douglas, made the Parish of Cambus-Lang a Prebend ; and, at the same time, appointed the Pre bendary and his Successors, perpetual Chancellors ofthe Cathedral at GlasgoAV. In consequence of this appointment, the Prebendary was obhged to reside at"], [288, "CAM Glasgow, and to serve the cure at Cambus-Lang by a Vicar, who had for his support the Vicarage Teind, now valued at 100 merks, with a house and 6 acres ofland, still known by the name of Vicar Land. It is in the Presbytery of Ha- milton, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Par- ish, in 1801, was 1558, and, in 1811, was 2035. It is 6 m. N. W. from Hamil- ton. This Parish contains about 4032 Scotch acres; of which, about 3800 are arable, and well cultivated. It is watered by the rivers Calder and Clyde ; the latter of which occasionally overflows its banks. The surface is beautifully diversified Avith hill and dale, consisting of a ridge of about half a mile broad, formed by the Dichmount, and Turnlea Hills, that extend nearly two miles from East to West. The principal manufactures are weaving, and spinning of cotton. The climate is healthy. The roads, and bridges, are in good repair. Coals, and excellent free-stone, are in great abundance. The Salary of the Parochial School, Avhich is in a flourishing condition, is 300 merks, together Avith School- fees, and a house and garden. Dichmount Hill appears to have been anciently a place of great strength: and, upon its summit, the Castle of Drumsargard was afterwards erected, to which an extensive Barony was annexed; this was the property successively of several families of great name, the Oliphants, the Murrays, the Douglases, and the Hamiltons; and it at present makes a part of the entailed estate of Hamilton. On the South side of Dichmount, stands Latrick, which, about the beginning of the Se\\*enteenth Century, was the seat ofa Sir John Hamilton, whose family is extinct, and the estate is now in the possession of The Duke of Hamilton. On the North side of the same hill, stands the House of Gilbertfield, which was long the residence ofa family ofthe name of Cunningham : about the beginning of the Eighteenth century, the estate was purchased by the Laird of West-Burn: Lieutenant William Hamilton, the friend and poetical correspondent of Allan Ramsay, lived many years, first at Gilbertfield, and then at Latrick, where he died on the 24th of May 1751, at an advanced age. The most considerable Resident family at present, is that of John Hamilton, Esq., of West-Burn: this Gentleman is descended from the Hamiltons, of Torrance; and these, from the Hamiltons, of Raploch, who were one ofthe oldest branches of the House of Hamilton : his ancestors took up their residence at West-Burn, upwards of two centuries ago. Upon the banks ofthe Kirk Burn, about a quarter ofa mile below the Church, there was a Cha- pel dedicated to the Virgin Mary, to which belonged 4 acres of land, that still retain the name of Chapel Land : there was also an Hospital two miles East"], [289, "CAM from the Church, to Avhich about 130 acres, called Spital and Spital Hill, seem to have been annexed: but the persons by whom, and the time when these Reli gious Houses Avere founded, are equally unknown. During the Ministry of The Reverend Mr. M'Culloch, in 1742, those remarkable Religious Ph\u00e6nomena took place, called \" Cambuslang Conversions\" ; and the place, where Mr. White field preached, is still called \" The Preaching, or Conversion Brae.\" CAMBUS-M1CHAEL, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Vicarage, belong ing to the Abbey of Scone, and now united to the Parish of St. Martin : the glebe consists of about 4 acres : Patron, The Crown, but The Earl of Mansfield is Titular of the Tythes here : The Church is in ruins. It is 6 m. N. from Perth. See, Martin's, St. CAMBUSMORE, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Callander. It is 2 m. S. S. E. from Callander. This is the Seat of Mr. Buchanan, plea santly situate on the Eastern bank of the water of Keltic CAMBUS-NETHAN, in the Middle Ward, and Shire of Lanark : formerly a Vicarage, belonging to the Abbey of Kelso ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, AA*as \u00a3150., and \u00a38. .6.. 8. for Communion elements : the manse is old, and in bad repair: the glebe consists of 3^ acres : Patron, Mr. Lockhart, of Castle- Hill, Proprietor of the Estate of Cambus-Nethan : The Church, which is in decent condition, was dedicated to St. Nethan or Nectanus, but it is much too small for the Congregation. It is in the Presbytery of Hamilton, and Synod of GlasgoAv and Ayr. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, Avas 1972, and, in 1811, Avas 2591. It is 4 m. E. from Hamilton. This Parish is about 12 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth, stretching from the banks ofthe Clyde, Avhich is the South-West boundary, to the confines of the Shire of Linlithgow on the East. The soil is, in general, clay, Avith a till bottom ; but the haughs are inclosed, and well cultiA'ated. Coals, iron-stone, and free-stone, are in great abundance. The Duke of Hamilton is Titular of the Teinds. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and a free house, and garden. Here is a Library, supported by annual Subscription, and contain ing a judicious selection of Books. This Parish is much indebted to the Public spirit ofthe late Sir James Steuart Denham, of Coltness, Avho began the im provements, Avhich have since been carried on with judgement and perseverance by his Son. The roads, and bridges, are all in the finest order ; and more thriving hedges and plantations are no where to be seen. Deep dells, and ravines, formerly over-run with brcom, furze, and heath, have lately been vol. i. G g"], [290, "CAM planted either Avith Fruit-trees, or Larches, both of which flourish exceedingly. This Parish affords a remarkable instance of the advantages which result from Country Gentlemen liA'ing upon their Estates. The principal Heritors, Lord Belhaven, Sir James Steuart, Mr. Steuart, of Allanton, and Mr. Lockhart, of Castle-Hill, all reside upon their respective estates, and honourably vie with each other in their improvement. Mr. Lockhart's Orchard yields, in ordinary seasons, from five to six Hundred Pounds per annum : And Sir James Steuart's Orchards, which are extensive, but mostly very young, promise to be no less productive. The Fiorin Grass also, which this Gentleman has lately introduced, will, it is hoped, in due time cover the mosses and moors with verdure. CAMBUS VIC HUSTAN, in the Shire of Sutherland ; and in the Parish of Assint. This is a small, but safe Harbour. CAMBUS VIC-KER-CHIR, i. e. Tlie Harbour of Farquhurt's Son, in the Shire of Sutherland ; and in the Parish of Assint. It is a safe, and well shel tered harbour, except from the North-East gales. C AMBUS-WALLACE, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Kill madock. It is 1 m. N. W. from Doune. Some years ago, several ancient graves were discovered near Rosshatt House; previous to which, a tradition prevailed here, that a battle was once fought near this spot between the families of Rosshatt and Craigton, and that several persons were then killed. C AMD ALE, v. KIRK MICHAEL. CAMELON, in the Shire of Stirling ; and in the Parish of Falkirk. This is a considerable Village, lately erected, and called New Camelon, at the distance ofa mile North-West from Falkirk. Here is a School-room, and a dwelling house, provided for the encouragement of a School-master, but no Salary is annexed. Old Camelon, which was situate about fixe furlongs, without the gate, where the Roman road issued from the Wall of Antoninus, was a Roman Town, and Sea-port ; and, it is said, that an anchor was dug up here in 1707 : very few vestiges of it noAv remain. There are circumstances, however, which authorise us to conclude, not only that the river Carr on has been navigable farther up than the site of Old Camelon, but also, that the sea came very near to Falkirk, and covered the whole of that District which is now called The Carse. General Roy has given a plau of Old Camelon in the Twenty-Ninth plate of his Military Antiquities, and which he supposes to be the Roman Station Ad Vallum. CAMERON, in the District of St. Andrew's, and Shire of Fife : formerly a"], [291, "CAM Vicarage : the Stipend of Avhich, in 1811, was 10 bolls 3 firlots of bear, 29 bolls 2 firlots and 6 lippies of sufficient oats, 98 bolls 2 firlots of black oats, at half price, together with \u00a3158.. 13.. 4.

It is in the Presbytery of St. Andrew's, and Synod of Fife. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1095, and, in 181 1, was 1005. It is 3| m. S. S. W. from St. Andrew's. This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and 4 miles in breadth : it is a high, cold District. Coals, and lime-stone, are abundant. The climate is remarkably healthy. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, and perquisites. In 1800, the claim of Bryan Lord Fairfax, of Cameron, to this Barony was con firmed by the House of Peers. CAMERON, HOUSE, v. BONHIL. CAMILLA, CASTLE, and LAKE, v. AUCHTERTOUL. CAMLACHIE, within the Jurisdiction of the City of Glasgow, and Shire of Lanark : in the Barony Parish. It is 1|- m. E. from GlasgOAV. This is a populous Village. CAMMIESTANE, v. KINTORE. CAMIS-ESKAN, v. CARDROSS. CAMPBELL-TOWN, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the District of Cantyre, and Shire of Argyle : formerly a Vicarage, consisting of the United Parishes of Kill-Ciaran, Kill-Caomhghin, Kill-Chonslan, and Kill-Michael, and belonging to the Abbey of Paisley : it is served by two Ministers, being for The Highland, and Lowland Charges ; by decreet of locality, of the 8th of December 1784, the whole Teinds of this Parish were divided between the tAvo Ministers : the Minister of the First or Highland Congregation having \u00a332.. 10..10| in money, \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements, 48 bolls 2 firlots 3 pecks of bear, Cantyre measure, and \u00a337..10..7.f. by Parlia mentary augmentation : The Minister of the Second or Lowland Congregation having \u00a323.. 13.. 1^-., \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements, and 48 bolls 2 firlots 3 pecks of bear, Cantyre measure, together with the Tack-duties of the Teinds of the Parishes of Kill-Calmonel, and Kill-Machoharmick, contained in a grant by Queen Anne to the Synod of Argyle, and paid by the Synod to this Minister, being \u00a38.. 17 .9j, which makes his Stipend the sameas that ofthe First Minister ; Gg2"], [292, "CAM but, according to the Teind Report, of the 15lh of February, 1812, there is a Process of Reduction of the Second Minister's Stipend, depending at the in stance of Mr. Campbell, of Killdalrig, who alleges that there is allocated upon him, beyond his Teind, the sum of \u00a30..18..11. ; and it is to be considered, whether the Tack-duties paid by the Synod can be esteemed as permanent, or Avhether they may be evicted by the Ministers ofKill-Calmonel,and Kill-Macohar mick: one of the glebes is distant, and partial ; and the other is under the legal extent, but the Minister has the legal allowance to compensate the deficiency : The Duke of Argyle is Patron of both Benefices : The Highland Church has lately been re-built ; and the place where the Castle of the great Macdonald formerly stood, is now occupied as a Church, in which the Minister of The LoAvland Charge enjoys the satisfaction of preaching the Gospel of Peace, on the same spot, from whence the Kings and Lords of The Isles issued, for ages, their arbitrary Mandates. It is in the Presbytery of Cantyre, and Synod of Argyle. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 7093, and, in 1811, was 7807. It is 176\u00a3 m. S. W. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. This was originally a small Fishing Village, and was erected into a Royal Borough in 1701, when it received its present name, from the Illustrious family of The Duke of Argyle, the principal pro prietor of the Town, and neighbourhood : Before that period, it went by the appellation of Ceann-Loch, i. e. Loch-Head, which it still retains in the lan guage of the country : But its oldest name is Dalruadhain, from its having been the Capital of the ancient Scotish or Dalreudinian Kingdom. It is now a large and flourishing Town ; and is governed by a Provost, two Baillies, a Dean of Guild, Counsellors, and a Treasurer. The Revenue of the Burgh arises solely from a lippie in the boll, levied on all the meal and grain brought in from the country, and from the tack profits of a mill, harbour dues, and Church seats. Campbell-Town is one of the Contributary Royal Boroughs with Irvine, in sending one Member to Parliament. It is admirably situate for carrying on the fisheries, which are prosecuted here Avith great success ; and it is appointed the rendezvous of the busses, employed in the Herring Fishery. The Harbour is about 2 miles long, and one mile broad, surrounded by high hills on each side, and with a small (called Davar) to shelter the entrance ; the anchorage is excellent, in from 6 to 10 fathoms water. Here is a good School, under the conduct of two able Masters : the Salary of one of them being \u00a320., which is paid by the Heritors, and that ofthe other \u00a310., paid by the Burgh. Here is a"], [293, "CAM Church ofthe Seceders, called Tlie Relief-House; a remarkably neat building, which was raised by a voluntary Subscription of \u00a32300., collected chiefly among the Posterity of oppressed natives ofthe Lowlands, who were encouraged to settle here in times of persecution by the Argyle family : these still keep themselves distinct from the old inhabitants, retain the zeal of their ancestors, are obstinately averse to patronage, but are esteemed the most industrious people in the country. The Parish of Campbell-Toavn comprehends a large portion of the Peninsula of Cantyre, being 11 computed miles in length, and from 6 to 10 miles in breadth. It is narrowed in the middle by the bay of Machir- Hanish on one side, and the Loch of Killkerran or Harbour of Camp bell-Town, on the other : the space between the two bays being* occupied by a large plain of about 4 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth, and not more than 40 feet aboA'e the level ofthe sea. From this plain, both ends of the Parish gradually become hilly, rising to the height of 1200 feet. The soil is various ; but, in general, the arable land is light and warm, and tolerably fertile. The climate is mild, but very rainy. At the distance of 3 miles, is abundance of excellent coal ; from whence a Canal has lately been cut, to convey it to the Town. The Chapels of St. Chouslan, and St. Caomhghin, though in ruins, are in tolerable preservation, and the ground about them is still sacred to sepulture : but the Chapel of St. Michael is completely demolished. Along the coast, are the remains ofa number of Forts, supposed to be Danish. It is in the Latitude of 55\u00b0 26' 15\" North, and the Longitude of 5\u00b0 32' 22\" West from Greenwich. CAMPBELL-TOWN, in the Shire of Inverness ; partly in the Parish of Petty, and partly in the Parish of Ardersier. It is If m. S. E. from Fort George. This is an improving Village, lately erected near the East entrance ofthe Moray Firth. The Population of that part of it, which lies within the Parish of Petty, and which is included in the Return made from thence, in 1811, was 200. CAMP MUIR, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Cupar. This is a small Village about two miles South-West from Cupar. Here one half of the army of Agricola is supposed to have been encamped, in his Seventh expedition. CAMPO, v. CARNOCK. CAMPS, v. CARNOCK. CAMPSIE, in the Shire of Stirling : formerly a Rectory, the Parson of which was the Sacristan of the Cathedral of Glasgow, and one of the Residentiary Canons there ; the Cure at Campsie being served by a Vicar : the Stipend, in"], [294, "CAM 1811, was \u00a380. Sterling in money, tAvo chalders of meal, and one chalder of barley : the manse, and offices, are in tolerable repair : the glebe consists of 5\u00a3 acres : Patron, Mr. Campbell, of Shawfield, who is also Titular of the Tythes, in virtue of his being the purchaser ofthe estate of Killsyth, from the Creditors of Tlie York-Building Company: The Church is too small, and, is inconve niently situate at the end ofthe Parish. It is in the Presbytery of Glasgow, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Villages of Campsie, and Lennox Town) was 2906, and in 1811, Avas 3705. It is 9 m. N. from Glasgow. This Parish is 8 miles in length, and 7 miles in breadth. Previous to its disjunction in 1649, by the Lords Commis sioners for Valuation of Teinds, it made a particular District of country by itself, not a little marked by peculiar manners and customs : it contained 150 plough gates of land, and being situate in.. Tlie Lennox, it formerly made the Eastern Division of that ancient territorial Thaneship. So late as the year 1744, the pay ment of Black Mail was made to Macgregor, of Glengyle, for protection against the depredations of the Highland freebooters. The last instance in this District ofa Baron of Regality exercising the Jurisdiction of pit and gallows over his dependents, is said to have been exerted by the Viscount of Killsyth, inthe year 1743 ; having condemned one of his own servants to be hanged for stealing silver plate from the house of Bancloich ; and the culprit Avas accordingly executed upon a hill on the Barony of Bancloich styled the Gallow Hill. This Parish consists of two ridges of hills, with a considerable Valley running East and West between them ; the South ridge being a continuation of the Braes of Killpatrick, and the North being knoAvnby the name of the Campsie Fells. The surface ofthe Strath is uneven, except on the banks ofthe Kelvin, and Glazert ; where the haughs are very fertile. Some of the hills are covered with natural trees, of great age and size ; and Avhere they are destitute of wood, they afford pasture to numerous flocks of sheep. The climate is very rainy, but not un healthy. Coals, and limestone, are abundant here. Tacks are commonly let for 19 yt;ars : and several Services are still retained, such as kain hens, and the driving of the Laird's coals. The Public Roads are in excellent repair. Here are two very extensive Print-fields, one of them being at the Kincaid or Easter Field, and the other at the Lennox Mill or Wester Field, both of which are carried on with spirit and success ; and an extensive Allum and Copperas work has also been established here. The Parochial School was erected in the year 1661, the salary being fixed at \u00a3100. Scotch (now 300 merks), together with School-fees :"], [295, "CAN and it is remarkable, that, in the deed of erection, there is an express clause, that the Master shall at all times teach Latin ; and that the School shall be constantly holden at the Clachan of Campsie. In 1727, another School was erected on a mortification of \u00a350., left by a person of the name of Young, a Pedler in Gloucestershire : this is situate at the distance of four English miles from the former : and the Heritors have, in an unaccountable manner, permitted one half of the legal salary ofthe Parochial School, to be added to the further emolument of this school, of the Eastern District. Besides these, there are Private Schools, which are well attended. Mr. Bell, of Antermony, a Gentle man well known to the learned, by his Travels in China and Persia, was a native ofthis Parish; where he inherited a considerable paternal estate, and died in the year 1780, at the venerable age of Eighty-nine. Here are two ancient Caledonian Forts, called The Meikle Reive, and Tlie Maiden Castle, both of them placed directly opposise to the Roman Wall, called Graham's Dyke; near which several urns, containing ashes and burnt bones, have been dis covered. The highest ridge of Campsie Fells is elevated about 1500 feet above the leA*el of the sea. CAMPSIE, The Linn of, v. CARGILL. CAMPSOIL, BAY, v. ROSSNEATH. CAMSTRADDEN, v. LUSS. CAMUS-TOWN, in the Shire of Forfar ; and in the Parish of Monikie. This was formerly a Village of some note, but is now reduced to three houses or families, who are chiefly employed in agriculture. It is situate about a qtiarter ofa mile South from the Church. Camus Cross, a large upright stone, is said to point out the place where Camus the Danish General was slain and buried, after the battle of Barrie, in 1010 : the ground about it is now occupied by a Planta tion of young wood. CANDACORL, v. GLEN-MUICK. CANDACRAIG v. TARLAND. CANDIDA CASA, Urbs, of Richard of Cirencester, v. WHITEHORN. C ANIBBER, in the Shire of Linlithgow ; and in the Parish of Linlithgow. Connected with this Parish, Rob Gibb, of facetious memory, may be mentioned: he acted as Buffoon to James the Fifth ; and, being on one occasion permitted to personate the Sovereign, gave a pointed reproof to the Courtiers, who urged their respective claims to royal favour, by declaring that he had always served his Master for \" stark luve and kindness.\" He received from that Monarch the"], [296, "CAN lands of West Canibber, near the Burgh, which were enjoyed by his descendants even in the Eighteenth Century ; and the original charter is said to be still extant. CANISBAY, or CANUTE'S BAY, in the Shire of Caithness ; formerly a Prebend, belonging to the Chapter of Caithness : the Stipend of Avhich, in 1811, AA'as 6 chalders of victual, one half meal, and the other half bear, with 200 merks of money, and the small Tythes : the manse, and offices, are in good repair : the glebe is a A'ery small one, and there is little or no grass annexed to it : Patron, Mr. John Sinclair, of Freswick ; The Church is in good condition. It is in the Presbytery of Caithness, and Synod of Caithness and Sutherland. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 1986, and, in 1811, was 1936. It is a m. W. b. S. from Huna. This is the most Northern Parish in the Island of Great Britain, and is computed to occupy about 50 square miles. It is rather a level than a hilly district ; the Warth Hill, which is of considerable height and magnitude, being the only one in the Parish deserving the name. The soil, wherever cultivation prevails, is a light black loam, with an intermixture of moss : heath in general predominates, where agriculture has not been intro duced: there are, however, considerable tracts of green pasture land, that re quire only the advantages of culture to be made productive. Peats of excellent quality abound here. The climate is mild, and salubrious. The Earl of Caith ness, John Sinclair, Esq., of Freswick, and the family of Brabster, are the only Proprietors. Unlimited Services are abolished. The Eastern Coast is every where exceedingly bold, and the wild and varied magnificence of the rocks are peculiarly striking to the eye ofa stranger: the Northern coast has but little of that stupendous boldness : and in coming down from The Head, and travelling Westward, the coast becomes level, having fields of the most fertile soil, and luxuriant verdure, approaching to the very beach, which here consists wholly of shells and shell sand, ofthe purest white, that contribute alike to beautify the shore, and to enrich the soil. There are no ships belonging to this parish, nor harbours in it to receive any : the Bays are those of Gills, Duncan's Bay, and Freswick, in all of which, if the weather be tolerably moderate, vessels can lie in safety, and take in their cargoes : but, none of them are to be regarded as eligible stations in stormy weather : Gills Bay is preferable to the rest. About 100 tons of kelp are made here, in favourable seasons. Gray fish of all kinds abound every where around the coast, and constitute a great part of the susten ance of the inhabitants : and in the Bays, lobsters are exceedingly plentiful. The Salary of the Parochial School is \u00a318. Sterling: besides which, tliere are tAvo"], [297, "CAN Society Schools with a Salary of \u00a310. each. Few superstitious usages are re- tained here : no Gentleman, however, ofthe name of Sinclair, either in Canisbay or throughout Caithness, will put on green apparel, or think of crossing the Ord on a Monday .* their brave ancestors were dressed in green, and they crossed the Ord on a Monday, in their way to the battle of Flodden, where they fought and fell in the service of their country, almost Avithout leaving a repre- sentative ofthe name behind them ; the day and the dress are accordingly re- garded as inauspicious ; and, if they must go beyond the Ord on a Monday, the journey is performed by sea. Game of all kinds abound here : and the coasts, throughout the year, swarm with innumerable flocks of sea-fowls. The Roads are bad. From Huna, the Ferry-boat crosses with the mails for Orkney once a week ; and from Burwick in South Ronaldshay, the Orkney mails in like man- ner cross the Pentland Firth to Huna: the distance, Avhich is here reckoned the shortest between Caithness and Orkrtey, being four leagues. The Town, and Ferry belonged of old to a gentleman ofthe name of Groat. The Scotch, with an intermixture of some Norwegian vocables, is the only language spoken here. Near to St. John's Head, on the North Coast, is one of the pleasantest spots in the whole Parish : it affords evident tokens of having been, in former times, a residence of great respectability; and in the neighbourhood are the ves tiges of an old Chapel, and a burying-gound. There are tAvo small Markets annually here ; one of them in February, and the other in December. In the summer, there is almost a continued communication between Caithness and Orkney, in the traffick of horses Barrogil Castle, a Seat of The Earl of Caith ness, is an ancient and venerable Pile ; and has of late been much embellished and enlarged by its Noble owner. Freswick, the Seat of John Sinclair, Esq., is a large and elegant modern building : of the old Castle of Freswick, situate to the South of the present Mansion, Mr. Pennant has preserved a view : it sus tained a memorable siege in the Twelfth century. Brabster Castle, the residence ofthe Sinclairs, is old, and situate in the most inland part ofthe Parish. There are also the ruins of two ancient Towers, situate on the Mainland, and a third, on the West side of the Island of Stroma ; all of them built on rocks surrounded by the sea, and formerly occupied as places of defence. Harvest begins here about the first of September, and is in general finished in the course of a month : at this season, the Aurora Borealis begins to exhibit itself, and in no part of Bri tain is it to be seen to more advantage. CANNA, ISLAND, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the Shire of Argyle : It vol. i. H h"], [298, "CAN constitutes part ofthe Parish of Small Isles. The Harbour is 30 computed miles from that of Eigg, and from whence the Minister performs Divine Service, once a Quarter. The Resident Population ofthis Island, in 1796, was 304, and, in 1811, was 370. It is about 4 computed miles in length, and one in breadth ; and affords excellent pasture, and tolerable tillage. It is situate very conveniently for the fishing grounds. This Island, which formerly belonged to The Bishop of The Isles, is noAv the property of John Macdonald, Esq., of Clanronald. It is low; but its shores are bounded by steep and lofty cliffs. It is remarkable for its harbour, which is reckoned one ofthe best among the Hebrides: yet it is difficult of approach in stormy weather, oAving to the narrowness of the entrance, and the sunk rocks that lie near it. This harbour is formed, upon the North, by Sand Island, Avhich is separated from Canna by a Strait, that is left nearly dry at every ebbing of the tide. The opposite side of the harbour is formed by the Island of Canna, which is here of considerable height, and rising by beautiful and regular basaltic terraces. Compass Hill is remarkable for its effect on the Mariner's Compass, having power to reverse the directions ofthe Poles; other places are magnetic, but in a less degree. See, Rum. CANOBY, or CANONSBY, in the Shire of Dumfries: formerly a Priory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 96 bolls of victual, half meal, half barley, and \u00a361. .2.. 2. in money: the glebe consists of 20 acres English: Patron, The Duke of Buccleugh, Avho is also sole Heritor of the Parish: The Church, manse, and offices, are in tolerable repair. It is in the Presbytery of Langholm, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 2580, and, in 1811, was 2749 It is 6 m. N. from Longtown. This Parish is about 9 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth, and contains upwards of 22,500 acres by mea surement. The surface is uneven, and diversified by a variety of ridges and flats, excepting the banks ofthe Esk, which are level. The central part is in tersected by the Esk; and the great road, from Edinburgh to London, by Lang holm and Carlisle, passes in the same direction, through the most beautiful and picturesque rural scenery, that is perhaps any where to be met with in Scotland. The soil, on the banks of the rivers Esk and Liddel, is mostly light loam, well cultivated, and productive, and sheltered by a profusion of natural wood and p*antations: upon the higher grounds, the soil consists ofa mixture of moss and clay, Avhich, when properly cultivated, is tolerably fertile. Coals, and lime-stone, are abundant. The chief rivers are the Esk, and Liddel, the latter of Avhich divides the Parish from England : both of these rivers, after collecting in their"], [299, "CAN different courses of nearly the same extent of 23 or 24 miles, a great number of tributary streams, meet at the Southmost part of this Parish, when the Liddel loses at once its name and waters in the Esk; which, after running from the point of confluence about 7 miles, in a South-West direction, discharges its united streams into the Solway Firth. The smaller river Tarras, having its source in the Parisii of Ewes, and separating, on the North-East quarter, this Parish from that of Langholm, is remarkable for its rugged channel, and romantic scenery, and for giving the title of Earl to Walter Scott, of High- Chester, who married Lady Mary, eldest daughter of Francis Earl of Buccleugh: the Patent bears date the 4th of September 1660. There are the appearances of several Chalybeate springs scattered throughout the Parish; but the only Mineral Well in this neighbourhood, that is resorted to for medicinal purposes, is the one at Heathet, which lies on the Cumberland side of the Liddel. The climate is rainy, but not unhealthy. Game, of various kinds, are abundant. The roads, and bridges, are in excellent repair. There are two Collieries; one of them at Archerbeck, and the other at Byreburn-foot ; there is also great abundance of the best lime-stone, especially at Harelaw-Hill, which is in the greatest re quest, as yielding the purest lime ; and the Parish every where abounds in free stone of various kinds. Mr. Bell, the tenant of the Farm of Woodhouse-Lees , is remarked for his superior skill and unremitting attention to all the operations of farming ; and this Gentleman has the merit of having first introduced into this Parish, the improvement of land by turnips and clover. The Salary ofthe Pa rochial and Grammar school is 300 merks, together with a house and garden, and the usual school-fees : there are five private Schools also, where reading, writing, and arithmetic only are taught. The Family of Petrie, natives ofthis Parish, are particularly eminent for their splendid talents and the honourable situations to which they have attained. This Parish being more immediately exposed to the predatory incursions of the English Borderers, presents many vestiges of strong holds ; although there is only one whose walls are yet entire. John Armstrong, a famous Border Chieftain in the reign of James the Fifth, styled John of Gill-Knocky, most likely had his residence here ; he was the terror ofthe West Marches of England; having forced the inhabitants of Cum berland, Westmoreland, and a great part of Northumberland, to become his tributaries, or to pay him Black-Mail, i. e. a Sum of money annually, to be ex empted from his depredations. At length, his power having grown too great for a subject, he became an object of jealousy to the King; who levied an army for Hh2"], [300, "CAN the avowed purpose of punishing Gill-Knocky and his followers, and marched at their head to the Parish of Ewes. Thither John was summoned to attend the king, upon the promise of his security; and having accordingly obeyed the sum mons, in violation ofthe public faith, pledged for his personal safety, as observed by Buchanan, he and his attendants were hanged at Carlenrick-Rigg, tAvo miles to the North of Moss- Paul, on the road between Hawick and Langholm. In Allan Ramsay's \" Ever Green, \" vol. 2. p. 190., is \" The true old Ballad\" of Johnie Armstrong, where it is said, \" the vulgar\" one is not genuine. ' To seik het water beneth cauld Yce, \" Surely it is a great folie ; * I haif asked grace at a graceless face, \" But there is nane for my men and me.\" About three quarters of a mile to the East of Gill-Knocky, are the remains of a Roman Station ; being the first of the chain that run through Esk-dale ; all of which Avere dependent upon the principal Station on the estate of Netherby, in Cumberland, now the property of Sir James Graham, Bart. : from this Camp, a Roman road can be traced, leading up Esk-dale to the different Stations in that quarter. Some ruins ofthe Convent, built before the year 1165, are still to be seen at Halgreen, or perhaps rather Holy or Holy-green, about half a mile to the East ofthe Church. From Halgreen, a private road to the Church is yet kept open through inclosed fields, which is sanctioned by use and wont. The Church and Convent are said to have been demolished by the English, after the battle of Solway Moss, about the end ofthe reign of James the Fifth ; which is not improbable, as the reason assigned in King Henry's Manifesto, for committing hostilities upon the Scottish Borders, not long before that event, was a pretended claim to the Parish of Canoby, as part ofthe English territory. Part ofthe old Avail ofthe Church still remains, to Avhich the modern building is united; and in which is preserved a small arch, that probably marks the place of sepulchre of some Prior, or person of Distinction; and which, from the style ofthe* sculpture, bears testimony of its antiquity. On the suppression of the Parish of Morton (now called Half-Morton), one half of it was added to the Parish of Canoby. CANONGATE, anciently HERBERGARE, within the Jurisdiction of The City and Burgh of Edinburgh The Chapel, adjacent to Holyrood Abbey, was long used as the Parish Church of Canongate ; but, inthe year 1686, James the Seventh having resolved to store The Order ofthe Thistle to its former splen-"], [301, "CAN dour, converted it into a Roman Catholic place of Worship, for the Installment ofthe Knights, and for other Solemnities belonging to that ancient Order. The Protestant inhabitants were thereby, for a time, deprived ofa Church ; and the inconvenience ofthis being severely felt, they gave in a Petition to the King, for a grant of as much ofa certain sum of money, which had been bequeathed to the Town Council of Edinburgh, by Thomas Moodie, in 1649, (for the purpose of building a Church, and which had never been fulfilled), as should be suffi cient for erecting a Parish Church in Canongate : this Petition the King was pleased to grant ; and, accordingly, the present Church was built, and a burial place annexed to it, in 1688, for the sum of 43,000 merks Scotch. A condition, however, was annexed to this Grant, that all persons, having a right to seats in Holyrood House, should be provided to the same extent in the new Parish Church : hence by far the greater part ofthe Area and Lofts in the Church of Canongate, is still the property either of the Incorporations, or of Noble Families, formerly connected with the King's Household : the repairs of the Church are maintained, under an agreement made in 1772, by Fifteen Dele gates, chosen annually, under the appellation of Managers of the Church and Church-yard Funds of Canongate : There are two Ministers ofthis Parish ; one of whom is presented by The Crown, and the other by tlie Joint Body of the Magistrates, Kirk-Session, Heritors, and Deacons of Craft ofthe Eight Incorpor ations : the Stipend of the First or Senior Minister is \u00a399. in money, and 51 bolls of victual, in equal proportions of wheat, barley, and oats; besides the Interest, at the rate of 5 per cent, of \u00a3500., provided for building or purchasing a manse, if the Incumbent shall require it to be laid out for that purpose. It is in the Presbytery of Edinburgh, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including The Tolbooth) was 5689, and, in 1811, was 7706. It is adjacent to the City of Edinburgh, on the East. The Burgh of Canongate, being a Vassalage to Edinburgh, is governed by a Baron Baillie, and two Resident Magistrates, who are chosen annually by the Town Council of that City. Their Jurisdiction extends beyond the bounds of the Parish, to the East side of The Pleasants, and to the Town of North Leith : they are ex officio Justices of peace in the County of Mid Lothian. There is a Public Grammar School in the Parish, under the Patronage of the Magistrates, and Kirk-Session : and the Rector has a Salary of \u00a336. for him self, and an Assistant. While Edinburgh was the Seat of Royal'y, The Canon gate was the place of residence of most ofthe Noble families who attended the"], [302, "CAN Court, and there are several old Houses which retain the names of the Noble OAvners ; but it is iioav chiefly inhabited by the loAver order of Trades-people. On the place Avhere the Canongate is at present situate, anciently stood the ToAvn of Herbergare, at the Eastern end whereof King David the First, in the year 1128, founded The Abbey of Holyrood-house ; at which time, the old name of Herbergare Avas obliged to give Avay, for the present appellation of the Canon gate ; so called from the Houses of the said Canons, and t^ie Street in Avhich they stood. This Abbey was founded by David the First, in 1128, for Canons Regular of the Order of St. Augustine, and dedicated to The Holy Cross. It was the richest ofthe Religious Houses in North Britain. In 1607, John Bothwell, Commendator of this place, and Son to Adam Bishop of Orkney, was advanced to the Peerage by the title of Lord Holy-Rood-House. This stately Abbey, together with the Choir and Cross of its Church, Avere destroyed by the Regent Duke of Somerset, in 1547, and nothing lest standing but the body of the Church, which is a magnificent Gothic Edifice. The Abbey Church, and The Royal Palace of Holyrood House, are surrounded with a Precinct or Liberty, which was anciently the Sanctuary belonging to the Monastery, and which at present affords an Asylum for insolvent Debtors ; the Boundaries being extensive, and comprising The King's Park, or St. Anne's Yards, and a space as far as Dudingston : and has its Baillie, who keeps Courts, and punishes Offend ers Avithin his Jurisdiction. The Palace is a very neat and handsome building, in the form of a square, the greater part being built by James the Fifth, and completed by Charles the Second. The square, in the centre, is surrounded Avith piazzas : and the chief rooms have lately been fitted up for the reception of a part ofthe unfortunate Royal Family of France, when obliged by the troubles in that Kingdom to take refuge in this country: there are, besides, apartments for the Commander in Chief for North Britain, for the Duke of Hamilton, as Hereditary Keeper of the Palace, and for other Noblemen. The great Hall, AA'here the Nobles of Scotland meet to choose the Sixteen Representative Peers, is hung round with imaginary Portraits ofthe Scottish Monarchs, from Fergus the First to James the Sixth. Mr. Grose has preserved four Views of The Abbey,' Pal ace, and Chapel of Holyrood-House. The Abbot of Holyrood, under the Charter of David the First was entitled to his Court, as fully, as the Abbots of Dunfermlin, and of Kelso, enjoyed theirs. This Jurisdiction seems to have been much extended by Robert the Third, both in magnitude and power ; by giving the Abbot a right of Regality over all his lands, in Avhatever Sheriff-"], [303, "CAN dom they might be situate, particularly over the Barony of Broughton, in the Shire of Edinburgh. These Jurisdictions seem to have been acquired by the Trustees of Heriot's Hospital. On the abolition of Hereditary Jurisdictions, in 1747, The Trustees of Heriot's Hospital claimed \u00a35000. for the Regality of Broughton ; but, Avere allowed only \u00a3486.. 19.. 8. In the middle of the Street which goes by the name of The Canongate Tolbooth, is a Court- Room for the Magistrates ofthe Canongate, and a Prison. These were built in the reign of James the Sixth. Debtors ofthe better sort are commouly taken to this Prison, which is well aired, has some decent rooms, and is kept tolerably clean. The Chapel and Hermitage of St. Anthony Avere situate in The King's Park, on the North side of Arthur's Seat. The spot was well adapted for an Hermitage. Although in the neighbourhood ofa populous City, it bore the appearance, and possessed the properties of a desart. The Cell of the Hermitage still remains : it is 16 feet long, 12 broad, and 8 high : the rock rises within two feet of the stone-arch which forms its roof; and, at the foot of the rock, flowed a copious and pure stream, which is celebrated in an old Scottish Ballad : but the Spring is iioav dried up. At the distance of nine yards East from the Hermitage, stood The Chapel of St. Anthony. This was a beautiful Gothic building, well suited to the rugged sublimity of the rock : it was 43 feet long, 18 broad, and 18 high : but it has been greatly dilapidated within these few years. Mr. Grose has preserved two VieAvs of it. CANON-MILLS, in the Shire of Edinburgh. This is a Village near Edin burgh, on the Water of Leith, and has extensive Flour Mills, and Distilleries. CANTRAY, v. CROY. CANTYRE, the Southern Division of the Shire of Argyle. This was the Country of the Epidii, of the Romans ; and the extremity, the Epidium Pro montorium, now Tlie Mull of Cantyre, noted for the violence of the adverse tides, compared to the force of a mill-race, from whence is the modern name. It is a Peninsula, lying between the Firth of Clyde and the Atlantic Ocean, and ioined to the Parish of Knapdale at the narroAV Isthmus of Tarbert. It is about 35 miles in length and from 5 to 12 miles in breadth : it is hilly, but not mountainous ; is open, and in general naked. It contains several Villages, but the only Town of consequence, is The Royal Burgh of Campbell-Town. In ancient times, when The Lords of The Isles ruled in all the pomp of Royalty, Cantyre was reckoned part of their dominions. In 1493, King James the Fourth offended at the inde pendent, ambitious, and rebellious conduct ofthe Macdonalds, held a Parliament"], [304, "CAP in Cantyre, where he emancipated part ofthe vassals of Macdonald in Argyle, and granted them, de novo, charters holding directly of the Crown : And, in 1536, to curb more effectually the license, and to subdue the haughty spirit of the Chieftain and his Vassals, James the Fifth found it necessary to make a voyage to The Isles. As the troubles ofthe times, and the weakness of Govern ment allowed the Macdonalds to commit outrages with impunity, they con tinued in the same course, despising the authority of their Sovereign, till, at length, the last miserable expedient of a weak Government was adopted, that of com missioning one Clan to chastise and subdue another : with that view, The Lordship of Cantyre, then in the possession of Sir James Macdonald, was granted to the Family of Argyle, who, aster many struggles, at last succeeded in bringing the Macdonalds to order : and, in the beginning ofthe Seventeenth Century, the Grant was ratified by Parliament, confirming to that Illustrious family the perpetual possession of Cantyre ; now Marquis of Lorn and Kintyre. Near the Southern Point of this Peninsula, is a Light-House, 235 feet above the sea at high water, situate on the rocks called Tlie Three Merchants, and which is very beneficial. CAOLISPORT, in the District, and Shire of Argyle: and in the Parish of South Knapdale. This Glen comprises the whole point of Knap, and constitutes a fine Loch, on the Atlantic Ocean, which abounds with fish of various kinds. It has also a commodious harbour. CAPELAW, v. COLLINGTON. CAPEL-HILLS, v. NEWHILLS. CAPE WRATH, v. DURNESS. CAPUTH, anciently CAPOCH, in the Shire of Perth: formerly a Vicarage, belonging to the Chapter of Dunkeld; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 22 bolls of oat-meal, 10 bolls of barley, Linlithgow measure, and \u00a359. in money, including \u00a38. .6.. 8. for Communion elements : the manse was built in 1754, and the offices in 1782: the glebe consists of about 8 Scotch acres: Patron, The Crown : The Church', which was built by Bishop Brown, in the year 1500, is not only very inconvenient, but too small for the Congregation. It is in the Pres bytery of Dunkeld, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (including the Villages of Meikleour, and Spittle-field) was 2097, and, in 1811, was 2333. It is 5 m. E. S. E. from Dunkeld. This Parish is situate in the District of Stormont, comprehending an extensive por tion of the vale of Strathmore, and stretching in length nearly 13 miles, and"], [305, "CAR varying in breadth from one to six miles and a half: besides which, there are several distinct, unconnected portions belonging to it, viz., Batholmie, locally situate in the Parish of Cargill ; West and Middle Gormack,in Kinloch ; East and West Logie, Cairns, Chapelton, MeadoAvs and Crofty, in Clunie ; and Craig town of Dalrulzian, in Kirk-Michael ; all in the Shire of Perth : \u2014 And, South Bandirran, in Collace ; Balbeuchly, in Aughterhouse ; Brough-Tay Castle and fishings, and a small piece of ground at Mylnfield, near Dundee ; and Fofarty in Kennettles, where there is a field of about 4 acres, called, from time imme morial, \" The Minister of Caputh's Glebe,\" and is believed to belong to him, though not hitherto occupied; all in the Shire of Forfar. \u2014 And these remote portions are now considered as belonging, quoad sacra, to the Parishes in Avhich they are respectively situate. On the high grounds, the soil is mostly a cold wet clay : but, on the banks of the Isla, and Tay, it is in general a light loam, and subject to inundations. The climate is dry, and healthy. Here are Quarries of excellent blue slate. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites. Fuel is expens_A*e. The roads are intolerable repair. Thirlage still continues here ; and it is much regretted, that this impo litic remnant of feudal tyranny is not entirely abolished. There are several cairns, and Druidical circles: and, ofthe first, one called Cairnmuir, is esteemed the largest in this country, being 456 feet in circumference, and 18 feet high. Inch-Tuthel, the modern Delvin, is the beautiful and hospitable Mansion of John Mackenzie, Esq., situate on a flat of 160 Scotch acres, regularly steep on every side, and in every part of equal height ; that is, about 60 feet above the great plain of Stormont, on which it stands : here the Picts are said to have had a town, which Boethius calls Tulina, and says, that it was populous and well fortified ; but deserted and burned by them, on the approach of the Romans under Agricola. The Romans also availed themselves of this situation ; and,' notwithstanding the great change made by inclosures, by plantations, and by agriculture, there are still the vestiges ofa Station five hundred yards square. Here Mr. Pennant fixes the Orrea, of Richard of Cirencester. CARADELL, v. SADDALE. CARA, ISLAND, off the Western Coast of Cantyre, and Shire of Argyle : it constitutes part of the Parish of Gigha, from which it is distant about a mile and a half to the SoutliAvard. This Island is nearly a mile in length, and half a mile in breadth. The shore is high and rocky, except at the North-East end, where there is a landing-place. It is principally appropriated to pasturage.. vol. i. I i"], [306, "CAR Various kinds of aquatic birds are innumerable ; and rabbits are also very abun dant. This Island is the property of Mr. Macdonald, of Leargie, and is occupied as a farm by one tenant. Adjoining to the Farm house, is an old Chapel, Avhich was formerly a burying-place, and is now converted into a kitchen. CARALDSTON, v. CARESTON. CARBERRY, in the Shire of Edinburgh } and in the Parish of Inver-Esk. It is 2 m. S. S. E. from Musselburgh. This Estate, Avhich was formerly the property of the Baronet family of Dickson, noAV belongs by purchase to Mrs. Fullarton, who resides here. On the abolition of Heriditary Jurisdictions, in 1747, Sir Rodert Dickson claimed a Regality over the lands of Carberry ; but his pretensions Avere not sustained. See, Inver-Esk. CARBETH, v. KILLEARN. CARBY HILL, a British Fort upon it, i*. CASTLE-TOWN CARC ANT, in the Shire of Edinburgh ; and in the Parish of Heriot. It is 3| m. S. from Middleton. Thomas Adinston, Esq., is the Proprietor of this Estate. Here are some vestiges of Houses, called Shiels- Walls. CARDONESS CASTLE, v. ANWOTH i CARDRONA, v. TRAQUAIR. CARDROSS, p. PORT. CARDROSS, in the Shire of Dumbarton: formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of Avhich, iu 1811, was \u00a3150. : the manse, and offices, are in good repair: Patron, The CroAvn, and the Minister is Titular : the Church underwent a complete repair in 1775, and, by the care and attention of the Heritors, is kept in the best possible order. It is in the Presbytery of Dumbarton, and Synod of GlasgoAv and Ayr. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 2549, and, in 1811, was 2859. It is 3| m. W. N. W. from Dumbarton. This Parish is about 7 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth, stretching in a beautiful manner along the Northern bank of the Clyde : on the East, it is watered by the river Leven. The ground rises with a gradual ascent from the shore, for upwards of two miles, till it terminates in a ridge of hills which separate it from the lands in the neighbourhood of the Leven, andLoch Lomond : on the shore, the soil is gravelly ; at a short distance, it contains a considerable mixture of clay ; and adjacent to the Leven, the lands are of the nature of carse. There is plenty of lime-stone on the estate of Camis-Eskan, the property of Mr. Denniston, of Colgrain ; and where large quantities are regularly burnt, with which the neighbourhood is"], [307, "CAR supplied. Attempts have been made to find coal in this Parish, but as yet they have proved unsuccessftil. The Public Roads are excellent. The natural wood is considerable, and nearly 200 acres have lately been planted, which are in a flourishing condition. The print-fields of Dalquhum, and Cordale, are by far the most extensive of any in Scotland. The Village of Rentown, which was begun to be built upon the estate of Mrs. Smollet, of Dalquhum, in 1782, has rapidly increased in size ; and, in consequence of the great demand for houses every where upon the Leven, a number of houses have been built, opposite to Dumbarton, upon feus from Mr. Denniston, of Colgrain ; and another Village has also been begun upon the property of Mr. Graham, of Gartmore. There are four Ferries ; tAvo of which are of great antiquity, as appears from the Charters ofthe Proprietors. The Yair Fishings upon the Clyde, so productive in this Parish, seem to be almost peculiar to it : those inclosures, which are the most favourably situate, are the property of Mr. Denniston, and Mr. Noble, of Noble-Farm : the right of these Yair Fishings proves them to be of very ancient date, being granted by Crown Charters upwards of five hundred years ago, and confirmed by all subsequent Charters. The Schoolmaster draws no Salary from the Heritors : the emolumeuts of his office arising* from his School -fees, and perquisites of Session Clerk, and from the yearly Interest on \u00a3100. Sterling, being a donation of a family of Killmaheio ; and which family have further very liberally added, the right to an acre ofland, a cow's pasture upon a specified Farm, and 5 bolls 1 firlot of bear, payable from certain other Farms npon the estate of Killmahew. Contiguous to the Village of Rentown, is the old house of Dalquhum, where the celebrated Tobias Smollet, M. D., was born, in the year 1720 : after a chequered life of fifty -one years, he died at Leghorn, whither he had gone for the recovery of his health, in 1771 : and adjacent to the place of his nativity, Mr. James Smollet, of Bonhil, his cousin, has erected a lofty column to his memory, with an elegant Latin Inscription. Upon a small emin- ence, called Castle Hill, a little to the Westward of the Leven, there was a Castle, it is said, which was occasionally the residence of King Robert Bruce : in this Castle, of which not a vestige is now discernible, that favourite Prince, as History and Tradition inform us, breathed his last : a Farm in the neighbourhood still pays to the Superior a feu-duty, called Dog-meal; which tax is supposed to have been originally imposed, for the maintenance of His Majesty's hounds. CARDROSS, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Kippen. It is 4 neu W.N.W. from Kippen. Tbis is the elegant Mansion of James Erskine, Esq., I i2"], [308, "CAR beautifully situate on the Northern bank ofthe Forth, over which a substantial Bridge was built in 1772. The Ancient and Noble family of Ekskine is Earl of Buchan, and Baron Cardross, of Monteith and Auchterhouse, in the Shire of Perth, so created in 1469. CARESTON, anciently CARALDSTON, in the Shire of Forfar : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of Avhich, in 1811, was 61 bolls of victual, about one third thereof being bear, and the remainder oat-meal, together with \u00a324..14..0. in money : the manse was rebuilt in 1802: the glebe consists of 6 acres : Patron, George Skene, Esq., of Skene, Avho is the only Heritor, and is occasionally resi dent: The Church was built in 1636, and got a considerable repair in 1808. It is in the Presbytery of Brechin, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resi dent Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 229, and, in 1811, was 271. It is 4 m. W. from Brechin. This Parish is about 3 miles in length, and one mile in breadth, and contains about 1500 acres. On the North side ofthe Parish, the soil is a black mould on a clay or till bottom, which is inconvenient in rainy seasons: on the South side, it is deep and fertile, lying on a bed of gravel, par ticularly that part Avhich is near the river Esk, and Avhich is apt to parch in dry seasons. The appearance of the country is beautiful, and well cultivated, with a gentle slope from North to South. The air is exceedingly pure, and healthful. It is watered by the rivers South Esk, and Norin, both of Avhich are subject to sudden inundations. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 400 merks Scotch, Avith a few School-fees, and \u00a32. Sterling for officiating as Session Clerk, a good School house, and garden, together Avith4 acres ofland, at alow rent, from Mr. Skene. Fuel is scarce, as the mosses are either exhausted, or converted into arable land ; coals are brought from Montrose, at the distance of 12 miles. The roads are excellent. The tenants have their leases on reasonable terms ; are happy in their intercourse with each other, and enjoy in a considerable degree the bless ings of social life. The Plantations are in a thriving condition, and nearly 200 acres of Scotch Pines are fit for use, that were planted about 40 years ago. The Mansion-House, which is in the Castellated form, was built some centuries ago by one of the Earls of Crawford ; around it, and on the Lawn, are some fine old trees, and the gardens are well stocked with fruit trees. The river Esk abounds Avith salmon, pike, and trout. Game is in plenty. The tenants are all freed from thirlage to the mill , paying only Knaveship or Miller's dues ; but several services are still retained. CARFRAE, v.

The surface \"is finely diversified with hill and dale, and Avith Avood and water. The soil is various ; but the greater part is inclosed, and well cultivated. The air is extremely pure, and salubrious. Near the West end ofthe Parish, the river Tay forms Avhat is called Tlie Linn of Campsey, by falling over a rugged basaltic dyke, which crosses the water at this place, and is found to extend in a right line many miles to the North and South of it : the most romantic and magnificent views on the Tay, are in this Parish. About half a mile above the village of Cargill, the river Isla unites Avith the Tay ; the fisheries of both which rivers are of considerable value, and are mostly all holden in lease by a Company in Perth. There are two Ferries over the Tay, and one over the Isla, Avhich are under excellent regulations, and the passage is safe and commodious. Several Quarries of free-stone, of good quality and colour, are Avorked to a great extent. An old custom is still presened here, called Gool- Riding, and the fine of one penny Sterling, for every stock of Goal found growing in the Barony, is rigidly exacted. A considerable manufacture of brown linens, and silesias, is carried on here ; and three bleachfields have lately been established. The roads are in tolerable repair. There are three Schools in the Parish, viz., sd Gattowhitt, Strelitz, and Woodhead .* the Salary of the estab lished School being 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a free house, and garden. Fuel is expensive. Services of all kinds are abolished. The vestiges of a Roman Road are still discernible along the high grounds."], [310, "CAR Stobhall, an old fabric, is fancifully situate on a narrow peninsula, upon the banks of the Tay : It has been in the possession of the Illustrious Family of Perth, since the year 1360, when Sir John Drummond, by marrying Lady Mary, the eldest daughter and co-heiress of Sir William de Montifex, Jus ticier of Scotland, and Chief of a most ancient family, obtained with her the lands of Cargill and Stobhall, which then became promiscuously the designa tion of the Family. Upon a romantic rock, which rises perpendicularly over The Linn of Campsey, are the ruins of an ancient Religious house, said to have been dependent on the Abbey of Cupar : and next to the Kings of Scotland, the Hays, of Errol, were the principal benefactors to this Monastery. The Abbey of Cupar was supplied with fuel from the wood of Campsey, and the road which the Abbots and Monks made use of to convey it thither, is still called Tlie Abbey Road. This Parish was formerly called The West Parish, and is said to have been only a part of the Parish of Cupar of Angus : but it has been considered a distinct Parochial district, as far back as the year 1514. CARINGTON, otherwise PRIMROSE, in the Shire of Edinburgh; for- merly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 32 bolls of barley, 32 bolls of oatmeal, and \u00a338.. 6.. 8. in money; the manse was built, in 1756, and under- went a thorough repair, in 1790; but the offices are paltry, and ruinous : Patron, The Earl of Roseberry : The Church was built in 1711, and is in bad repair.

The climate is healthy. The Schoolmaster's salary is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a small house, and garden. The Roads are in bad repair. Coal, of an excellent quality, abounds here. In 1633, William Lord Ramsay was created Earl of Dalhousie, and Lord Car- ington: but, during the subsequent distractions, he found it necessary to sell this Barony, Avith the Patronage of the Church of Carington, to Sir Archibald Primrose, then Clerk ofthe PriA'y Council: and, when he was made a Senator of The College of Justice, he assumed the title of Lord Carington. James, the first Viscount of Primrose, upon his creation, in 1703, changed the name ofthis"], [311, "CAR Parish from Carington to Primrose; but, this new name has been confined to writings only; while the old one, by its common pronunciation of Cairnton, con tinues to be used in colloquial intercourse. On the abolition of Hereditary Jurisdictions, in 1747, Lord Dalmeny was allowed \u00a3101. .13.. 7. Sterling, for Primrose Regality, over the lands of Carington. Primrose, a Seat ofthe Noble family of Primrose, now gives the title of Viscount to The Earl of Roseberry. CARLE1TH, v. ALDIE. CARLETON, v. DAILLY. CARLICKE, v. CARLUKE. CARLIN-RIGG, v. CAVERS.

The soil is various ; the holms of the Clyde being a rich deep clay, while those on the Medwin are inclined to sand: the muir-land parts of the Parish area cold stiff clay, mixed with moss. The climate is uncom monly wet during the Spring ; and early frosts are often very destructive. Coals, iron-stone, lime-stone, and free-stone, are in great abundance : and a very extensive Iron-foundery is carried on at Wilson- Town. The House of Camwath never was the residence ofthe Lockhart family, but has occasionally been used as a Hunting-Seat.

David the Second conveyed this Barony to Alexander de Cockburn ; because John de Vetereponte had alienated his rights, Avithout the King's license, first obtained. CARRON, in the Shire of Stirling ; and in the Parish of Larbert. It is situate on the Northern bank of the river Carron, at the distance of 3 miles from its entrance into the Forth, and two miles North from Falkirk. At this Village are the celebrated Carron Works, Avhich are carried on by a Chartered Com pany, and which is one of the most extensive Iron Founderies in Europe. Here all kinds of cast iron goods are manufactured; not only the instruments of war, but various implements of agriculture, the arts, and for domestic use : and the greater part of these commodities, whether of ability or ornament, can be fur nished at one-third of the price which they cost elsewhere : but labour and workmanship are in this place assisted and hastened by so many machines and ingenious processes, that its commodities are executed both in a shorter time, and in greater perfection, than in any other estsblishment ofthe same kind. At Carron Shore is a School, for the benefit ofthe children of the numerous manu facturers. At a place called Stone-house, a little distance from the Founderies, upon a gentle eminence above the river Carron, stood that celebrated antiquity, called Arthur's Oon or Oven, which the ingenious Mr. Gordon supposes to have been a Sacellum or Little Chapel, a repository for the Roman Insignia or Stand ards : This building Avas circular, upright on the sides, and rounded toAvards the top, in which was an opening eleven feet six inches in diameter : Beneath this was on one side, a square aperture, like a window ; under that, a door, whose top formed a Roman arch. The height to the round opening at the top, was 22 feet ; the inner diameter of the building, at the bottom, 19 f. 6 in. ; round the inside, Boethius says, there were stone seats ; and on the South side, an altar : he also acquaints us, that the floor was tessellated, as appeared by the fragments that might be picked up in his time. But, to the mortification of every curious traveller, this matchless edifice is now no more : \" its barbarous owner, a Gothic Knight,\" says Mr. Pennant, \" caused it to be demolished, in order to make a milldam Avith the materials, which, within less than a year, the Naiades, in resentment of the sacrilege, came down in a flood"], [319, "CAR and entirely swept away.\" General Roy has given a Ground Plan and Eleva tion of it in the Thirty-sixth Plate of his splendid Military Antiquities.

Mr. Macadam, of Craigengillen, is Proprietor of one-half of the Parish; the other half being divided among four teen different Heritors, only two of whom are resident. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites. The Parish of Carse-Fairn, so late as about the year 1640, constituted a part of the Parishes of Dairy, and Kells : and these parts of Carse-Fairn still pay Stipend to the Ministers of Dairy and Kells respectively, as well as to their own Pastor. C ARSETHORN BAY, v. KIRKBEAN. CARSLOGIE, v. CUPAR of FIFE. CARSTAIRS, or CAER-STAIRS, in the Upper Ward, and Shire of Lanark : formerly a Rectory and Vicarage, belonging to the Chapter of Glasgow ; the Stipend ofwhich, in 1811, was \u00a3150., and \u00a38..6..8. for Communion elements: the manse is in decent repair : the glebe consists often acres : Patron, Mr. Ful lerton : The Church has lately been rebuilt in an elegant style. It is in the Pres bytery of Lanark, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 899, and, in 1811, was 875. It is 3 m. W. from Carnwath, and 28 m. S. W. from Edinburgh. The Fairs are holden on the first Thursday, O. S. , in May, the second Thursday, O. S. , in July, and the second Thursday, O. S., in November. This Parish is 6 miles in length, and 3 miles"], [320, "CAS in breadth. The higher ground is a mixture of clay and mossy earth, and the loAver a sharp sandy soil ; both districts are of a good quality, and capable of pro ducing excellent crops. Coals, and peats, are in abundance. On a rising ground near the Clyde, are the vestiges of the Roman Station , called Castle Dykes ; and where several Roman coins, instruments of Avar, and culinary utensils, have been discovered : according to General Roy, who has given a plan of it, pi. 27., some remains ofa bath and other antiquities have been found near the Church; so that Cars I airs is in all probability the Coria, of Richard of Ciren cester: the great Roman road from Lugubalium or Carlisle to the Wall of Antoninus, runs through it. The ancient Castle is completely demolished. The House of Carstairs, the elegant Seat of Mr. Fullerton, the principal Heritor, is surrounded with extensiAe and cultivated fields, and thriving Plantations. CARTER-TOWN, v. HUTTON. CARTSDIKE, v.

Castle Cary, according* to General Roy, hath been one of the principal Stations on the Wall of Antoninus**, as is evident from its dimensions, and the number of antiquities discovered there. A Roman Wav has led out from it towards the South ; it is situate in the centre of the country of the Damnii; from all which circumstances, together with the re markable affinity of its name, it seems probable that this place was the Coria Damniorum, of Ptolomey, and the same which Nennius calls Caer Ceri. Gen eral Roy has preserved a plan of it. pi. 35., and of the antiquities discovered there, pi. 39. CASTLE-DOUGLAS, formerly CARLINWARK, in the Stewartry of Kirk cudbright; and in the Parish of Kelton. It is 87 m. S. b. W. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here, where Mails are dispatched and receiA'ed daily, to and from all the principal Post-Offices in Great Britain, and Ireland. This Village is situate at the North comer of the Carlinmark Loch, on the great Military Road, and was lately erected into a free and inde-"], [321, "CAS pendent Burgh of Barony, under the Superiority of William Douglas, Esq., the principal Heritor, when it acquired its present name. It is a very increasing place ; but one great hindrance to the establishment and conduct of extensive manufactures, is the scarcity of fuel. The Carlinwark Loch, which was partly drained in the year 1765, is one great source of improvement to Kelton, and the neighbourhood : it contains in itself, and the mosses adjoining, an inexhaustible fund ofthe best shell marl, which is conveyed to distant parts, by means ofa Canal that connects the Lake and the water of Dee.

It is pleasantly situate on the Northern declivity ofthe Cathkin Hills, and is the family seat of Sir John Stuart, Bart. This ancient place was, for many centuries, known by the name of Castle- Town, but is now more fre quently called Castle Milk, from a Castle on the river Milk in Anandale, which was anciently possessed by Sir John's Ancestors. The whole building is kept in excellent repair; and an apartment is shown, in which Queen Mary slept the night before the battle of Langside. The ceiling of this memorable room is ornamented with the arms of the Kings of Scotland, in the Stuart line, and with the arms of all the Crowned heads of Europe, with whom the Stuarts were vol i.

CASTLE-TOWN, in the Isle of Man ; and in the Parish of St. Malew. It is 9 m. S. S. W. from Douglas. The Resident Population of this Town, in 1792, Avas 785. The Market is little frequented. Castle-Town, though digni fied Avith the residence ofthe Governor of The Isle, is in wealth and mercantile importance greatly inferior to Douglas. It is, hoAvever, the Capital ofthe Island, and is an airy and pleasant Town ; and though considerably smaller, surpasses the other in neatness ; the houses being more uniformly elegant, and the streets more spacious and regular. Few strangers dwell here, and it is said that the natives do not associate with them upon easy terms. The Town is divided by a small Creek, which opens into a rocky and dangerous Bay. The difficulty of entering its harbour certainly in some degree injures its commerce. A consi derable quantity of grain is ho aa* ever annually exported, and a variety of mer chandize imported: but the articles of rum, Avine, sugar, tobacco, &c, according to the regulations of the Customs, being admissible only into the Port of Douglas, are from thence conveyed to the other ToAvns ofthe Island. In the centre ofthe Town, Castle-Rushen rears its gloomy and majestic brow, and for several miles overlooks the subject country. It was considered the chief Fortress ofthe Island, and is now the only Prison. This solid and magnificent Pile was raised in the year 960, by Guttred, a Prince of the Danish line, Avho lies obscurely buried in the edifice which he had founded. Before the subjugation of Man by the Eng lish, the Kings of the Island resided here in all the warlike pomp of those ages."], [323, "CAS In the annals of modern history The Isle of Man is distinguished by Mr. Hume, as the last place in Europe, tributary to the English, which yielded to the arms of the Republic: when this Castle Avas surrendered to them by the Governor, Sir Thomas Armstrong, who had been placed in it by the heroic Countess of Derby, the gallant defender of Latham House, and who with her children had sought an asylum in Castle-Rushen. It still retains an air of Royalty; and within the walls are the Lieutenant Governor's house, and the Barracks. The Courts of Chancery and Common Law are holden here. Near the Castle stands The House of Keys, a building certainly not corresponding with the dignity of the Representatives ofthe Island. The Free School is formed of an old Chapel, dedicated to St. Mary, and consecrated in 1250. This Institution was established by Dr. Barrow about the year 1670, for the purpose of supplying the Church with Ministers. The funds are lodged in eight Trustees, and arose primarily from some Tythes which were purchased of the Lord Proprietor Avith a sum of money raised for that purpose by voluntary contribution. They have since been increased by a few donations and legacies. Four Students are educated free of expense ; and, from the time of their leaving School to their promotion, they are alloAved an amiuity of \u00a325. The Professor must be a Master of Arts of one of the British UniA'ersities, and is allowed a Salary of \u00a360. The Gallows has not been used since the year 1745. The Statute Book of Man is preserved in the Castle: but the Archives of the Island were carried away by The Countess of Derby. CASTLE-TOWN, in the District of Castle-town, and Shire of Roxburgh: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3155.. 5. .0. : Patron, The Duke of Buccleugh : The Church, which is dedicated to St. Martin, is in bad repair : There have been no less than Five Chapels or Churches in this Parish, besides the Parish Church, viz., Ettleton, and Hermitage, which are still used as Burying-grounds ; Dinlabyre, and Chapel -Know, where many grave-stones appear ; and The Wheel Church, at the head of the Lid, which has been of large dimensions, and of excellent masonry, and Avhere there are still many memorials ofthe dead ; this Church, it is thought, derived its name from its position near The Wheel Causeway, the modern name of the Roman Road which leads down from Stanmore, and crosses the North-East corner of Lid's-Dale into Teviot-Dale. It is in the Presbytery of Langholm, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, Avas 1781, and, in 1811, (including the thriving Village of New Castle- Town) Avas 1887. It is L12"], [324, "CAS 20 m. S. b. E. from Hawick. This Parish is of great extent, being upwards of 18 miles in length, and 14 miles in breadth, and containing about 52,160 acres. It occupies that District, Avhich Avas anciently denominated Lidisdale or Lid's- Dale, from the river Lid, Avhich runs through it in a direction from the North East to the South. In the old Histories, and Geographical descriptions of Scot- land, it is called The County of Lidisdale, and, in old Writs, it is styled The Lordship of that name. In the month of December 1540, the Lands, and Lord- ship of the Forest of Jedburgh, Avith the Lands, and Lordship of Lidisdale, were annexed to the CroAA'n, by Act of Parliament : And, on the 2d of January, 1648, the Lands, and Dominion of Lidisdale, appear to have been granted to Francis Earl of Buccleugh. The general appearance of the upper part ofthe parish is mountainous ; the lower part is hilly ; and all of it, at a distance from the banks ofthe rivers, is bleak and wild in a high degree ; but, on the sides of the rivers, it is very different ; these are covered with natural wood and exten- sive plantations, Avhich afford an infinite variety ofthe most picturesque scenery. The inhabited part ofthe Parish consists of two Vallies : that which borders on the Hermitage is about ten miles in length, from the source of the river to the point where it loses its name in the Lid or Liddal: at the head ofthis river the country is entirely mountainous ; these mountains are very high and steep, but are generally dry, and afford excellent sheep pasture : the greatest part of this stream is fringed with natural wood, and possesses much rural beauty : The other Valley or Strath, is that along the sides ofthe Lid : near the head ofthe Parish on the East, the rivers Lid and Tyne, take their rise, in the midst of an immense bog, which is surrounded by mountains : this place is very properly named Dead Water, because, for a considerable space neither of them can be traced as a running stream : the Tyne Avinds slowly to the East, between the bleak mountains and the dreary Avastes of Northumberland, by Keelder Castle, a Hunting Seat of The Duke of Northumberland: the Lid runs due West for a feAv miles, and then flows due South : this part of the country is mountainous, high, cold, and moist, and lies under the thick and solitary gloom of continual fogs ; for ten miles doAvn the river, its banks are entirely naked ; but the Hills on each side produce a great quantity of grass ; at the point, where it is joined by the Hermitage, the banks are coAered with trees ; on the North side, the thriving plantations of The Duke of Buccleugh, and on the South, the planta tions and Avoods of Mr. Elliot, of Whitehaugh, near the confluence of the rivers, form a landscape extremely beautiful ; here the valley widens considerably, and"], [325, "CAS improvements are every where seen ; from this hill you reach the confines of Canonby, whither the ride is very much admired by travellers. The principal Mountains are Great Moor, Millenwood Fell 2000 feet, Tudhope 1830 feet, Windhead 2000 feet above the level of the sea, and Tinnis Hill, which is seen as a land-mark at a great distance from the ocean. The Rivers are the Lid or Liddal, the Hermitage, the Tweeden, the Tinnis, the Blackburn, and the Kershope, which divides the Kingdoms of England and Scotland ; all of them are plentifully stored with trout, and afford excellent sport to the angler. The climate is very damp ; but, notwithstanding, those who are bred in the country enj\u00b0y g\u00b0\u00b0d health, and many of them have arrived at a great age. Though the hills are moist, yet, from the reflection of the sun from each side of the valley, and its favourable exposure in summer, the Aveather is then very warm, and the harvests are early : Oats and Peas are sown in March and April ; Barley in the end of April or beginning of May, and theyare all reaped in September. The Schoolmaster's Salary is 300 merks, besides his perquisites arising from his office of Session Clerk, Precentor, Marriages, Collections, the Poor's Rates, and School-fees. There are two other Schools in the Parish, supported by private contributions. There is no place where the Poor are better provided for than in this Parish ; and no person is allowed to beg. A Friendly Society has been established, which promises to be very useful. Until Avithin these few years, this extensive Parish was totally destitute of Roads ; but, by the liberal and patriotic spirit of Mr. Oliver, of Dinlabyre, and Mr. Elliot, of Whitehaugh, a Road was begun, and is carried along the side ofthe Liddal for seA'eral miles : a Bridge has been built over the Hermitage, and another over the Liddal; these, together with that part of the Road already made, are of the greatest service to the country, and to many travellers, who have begun to pass this way from Carlisle to the Northern Markets, and into the Shire of Berwick ; this Road being much nearer than that by Langholm, and Moss-Paul. The fuel chiefly used here is peat, of Avhich there is an inexhaustible fund : there is coal also in the lower part ofthe parish, which is Worked on the estate of Mr. Oliver. As there was no regular Village in the Parish, The Duke of Buccleugh, with generous sentiments for the public good, resolved to build one, and, accordingly, laid down a beautiful Plan on the Farm of Park, on the banks of the Liddal, in a field of upwards of 100 acres of fine land, and named it, Castle-Town : it consists of two principal Streets, bearing the names of the two rivers, Liddal and Hermitage, with several cross streets at right angles : there is a Square, called Douglas Square, in the centre, for a Market- Place, consisting of about two"], [326, "CAS acres of ground, round which the buildings consist of two stories : near each extremity, tliere is a smaller Square : the Street is 54 feet wide, in the principal Square it is 100 feet : They hold of The Duke, pay a small sum by way of Feu duty, and have each a good garden : every Feuer has grass for a Cow on the hill, for Avhich they pay \u00a31. : for each house, they have two acres of holm land, for 14 years, for which they pay a certain sum. A situation more favourable for carrying on manufactures is scarcely to be found. Tradition says, that the Earth of Lidisdale has a peculiar quality of banishing the common Rat from Teviotdale : it is certain, that, only a feAV years ago, Carriers on heir return to that part ofthe country loaded their horses with it, and carried it away for that purpose ; a remarkable instance of credulity ! A great variety of birds is to be met with here ; among which, the beautiful Black-cock frequents the Avoods : Eagles, of an amazing strength, are often seen, but have no place of residence here. There is great plenty of lime-stone in the Parish ; and quarries of excellent free-stone are every where found, except at the head ofthe Hermit age, where there is nothing but blue whin-stone. Here are several sulphureous Springs, which are occasionally resorted to by invalids : and a very strong mineral Spring has been discovered at Lawstown _ there are also several Springs of petrifying water, especially one on the Tweeden, which is very powerful. There are several beautiful Water-falls on the river Tweeden, the little streams of Dinla byre, Harden, and Sundhope ; but, on the river Blackburn, such objects are seen in all their beauty and variety ; in this wild and romantic vale, nature appears in the most pleasing, and often awful and sublime, forms ; here, one of the greatest curiosities in the county, or perhaps in Scotland, is a natural Bridge of stone over the river Blackburn ; it stretches across the stream, and joins the hills on each side ; it is 55 feet long, 10 feet wide, and the thickness of the arch is 2 feet 4 inches of solid stone ; it is not composed of one entire rock, but has the appearance of many stones about a foot and a half square, set neatly together; the bridge slopes a little downwards, and the Avater rushes under the arch, through an opening of 31 feet. This Parish gave birth to the celebrated John Armstrong, M. D., whose father and brother Avere Ministers of it; and who has so sweetly described the beauties of his native vale, in his highly finished Poem on Health, Book III. There are several monuments of great antiquity in the Parish, but their origin and their history are involved in much obscurity : even tradition itself says little concerning them. Though this parish comprehended a great part ofthe Middle March betAveen the two Kingdoms, yet, excepting a few detached facts, there is nothing of consequence preserved or related by"], [327, "CAS historians. As it lies directly along the English Border, it must have been, fora long period, the scene of fierce contentions ; these exploits have been recorded in the old Songs and Ballads ofthe times, which arc still sung by the aged, and listened to with eagerness by the young. \u2014 Hermitage Castle stands upon the bank ofthe river of that name ; it is said to have been built by Sir Ranulph de Soules, then Warden of the Border, in the reign of David the First: it has been a very strong* building, nearly 100 feet square, defended by a strong* ram part and ditch ; the walls are almost entire : the inner part is a heap of ruins : in this Castle, Sir Alexander Ramsay, of Dalhousie, was starved to death by Sir William Douglas, Earl of Lidisdale, in 1342 ; This Castle was also visited by the ill-fated Queen Mary, in the year 1561, on occasion of Earl Bothwell's being Avounded by John Elliot in Park ; Her Majesty came from, and returned to Jedburgh in the same day, not only a long journey, but over mountains, and through marshes almost impassable ; in one of those marshes, a few miles from the Castle, her horse stuck in the moss, which is still called The Queen's Mire. Within a few yards ofthe Castle, are the remains ofthe ancient Chapel of Hermitage, now in ruins, in the middle ofthe burying-ground, which is still in use ; the Font is inserted in the Avail ofthe Church-yard : \u2014 The Chapel, Castle, and river Hermitage, derive their name from the Cell of a Hermit, who had retired thither : they give Title to the eldest son ofthe Noble Family of Delo rane ; Lord Henry Scot, third son of James Duke of Monmouth, by Anne Duchess of Buccleugh, having been created Earl ofDELORANE, Viscount Her mitage, in 1706. Old Sir Richard Maitland, who, as a Border Commissioner of long experience, knew this country, has left us a Poem on \" The Thieves of Liddale A \u2014 yet the \" Crystal\" Liddal was \" unknown in song, though there be not a purer stream,\" \u2014 until Armstrong \" first drew air on its Arcadian banks.\" The Castle of Clintavood, on the farm of Flight, appears to have been a very strong building ; the foundation, and a little part ofthe wall, are still to be seen. This Castle, from which the Parish derives its name, is situate on the upper part ofthe glebe, and, in former times, must have been impregnable on the East and North ; on the East, it is defended by a very deep ravine ; on the North, by the Liddal, and a precipice of more than one hundred feet in perpendicular height ; and, on the West and South, by two ramparts of great strength, and a fosse of great depth. The only Peel-House, that remains entire, is Huds-House ; the vault is immensely strong, and has had double doors, bolted on the inside. There were many square Towers formerly in this country, Avhich Avere the places of"], [328, "CAS residence ofthe principal families, and all of them places of strength : they were chiefly on the banks ofthe river Liddal, viz., Peel, Huds-house, Prickinghaugh, Whitehaugh, Hill-house, Riccarton, Mangerton, and Puddingbum, but nothing remains of them, except the foundations. \u2014 The principal Camp, is on the top of Carby Hill : this Hill is detached from all others, and commands a view ofthe whole country, and of all that part of Cumberland, about Bees Castle: the Camp is entirely circular, and occupies the whole summit ofthe hill ; it is fortified by a very strong wall of stones, and a road plainly appears to have been made up to it, winding round a part ofthe hill, and entering it on the South: it is about 100 yards diameter : in the centre, a small space is inclosed with a strong wall, and round it are eight circles of different sizes, all surrounded by a stone wall, and all of them having had a door or opening to the East : of this ancient and very curious Camp, Sir John Sinclair, with his usual discrimination, has pre served a view, vol. 16. p. 83. \u2014 On the summit of The Side Hill, and nearly opposite to Carby, on the North side ofthe Liddal, there is another strong en campment, nearly ofa square form : it is 300 feet in diameter : the wall or ram part is entirely of earth, and is about 18 feet high : this Camp has none of the interior circles of the former. \u2014 On the Farm of Flight, and near to the Castle of Clintwood, there are two Camps at a little distance from each other ; the one round, and fortified with a stone wall, which was carried away in 1793 ; when, at a considerable depth, two instruments of brass were discovered ; it is about 100 feet in diameter ; the other is square, and about 168 feet in length, sur rounded by two ramparts of earth. It is also said, that a Roman Legion wintered in Lidisdale, cut down wood, and drained marshes. \u2014 There are a great many Round-abouts in the Parish, commonly called Picts Works; they are all circular, and strongly fortified by a wall, composed of large stones : they are numerous, and are always placed one at a little distance from, and opposite to another : there are two of them near Heeds-house, two on the farm of Shaws, one on Toft-holm, one on Foul-shiels, one on Cocklaw, one on Blackburn, and one on Shortbut- Trees the stones of which having been removed, there was discovered, on the South side of it, a place 10 feet wide, and 20 feet long, paved with flat stones, and inclosed by others on each side, seton edge, within which there seemed to be ashes and burnt wood. \u2014 On the farm of Millbum, there is a small circle inclosed by nine stones, which appears to have been a Druidical temple : tradition says, Lord Soules was burnt there : the hill is called Nine Stone Ridge. \u25a0 \u2014 There are many Cairns in different places, some of which have been opened,"], [329, "CAR and various antiquities discovered in them ; the most remarkable of these is, on the farm of Whisgills; the quantity of stones is immense, and they are mostly of a very large size ; near these, there is a large stone set on end, about 5 feet high, called The Standing Stone ; this Cairn is in the middle of an extensive and deep moss ; it can be approached on horse-back only on one side, and that Avith much difficulty ; there is not a stone to be seen near it. \u2014 Upon The March be- tween the Parishes of Castle-Town and Canonby, and upon very high ground near to Tinnis- Hill, there is a Cairn of great extent, and consisting of freestones of great size ; it is 86 yards long ; it is not-possible to approach it on horse-back ; the stones are chiefly ofa square form, of immense weight, and what is very remarkable, there is not a stone to be seen, nor a place where stones could be found, within a great distance of the place ; at the North end of it, there are several large stones set on their edges, forming a square, and covered over by one stone ; near to the South end, there is one standing perpendicular, evidently so placed by the hand of man, 7 feet above the moss, and 13 feet in circumfer- ence ; this Avas anciently called The Standing Stone, and was considered the North boundary of Canonby, or The Debateable Land ; on examining the adja- cent ground, five other stones Avere discoA'ered, nearly of an equal size Avith the former, all inclining to, or lying on the ground, and forming a circle, the diameter of which is 45 yards. \u2014 At Mill-holm there is a Cross of one stone, 8 feet 4 inches high, set in a base of 1 foot 8 inches ; this is a piece of great antiquity ; a sword 4 feet long is cut out on the South side of the Cross, and immediately above several letters, of which a figure is given by Sir John Sinclair, vol. 16. p. 83. : the Tradition, concerning this Cross, is, \u2014 One ofthe governors of Hermitage Castle, some say Lord Soules, others Lord Douglas, having entertained a passion fora young woman in the lower district ofthe Parish, Avent to her house, and was met by her father, who, wishing to conceal his daughter, was instantly killed by the Governor : he was soon pursued by the people, and, in extreme danger, took refuge with Armstrong, of Mangerton, Avho had influence enough to prevail on the people to desist from the pursuit, and by this means saved his life : seem ingly Avith a view to make a return for this favour, but secretly jealous of the poAver and influence of Armstrong, he invited him to Hermitage Castle, where he Avas basely murdered : he himself, in his turn, was killed by \" Jock ofthe Side,\" of famous memory, and brother to Armstrong: the Cross Avas erected in memory ofthis transaction, near to Ettleton Church-yard, where he was buried, and almost opposite to Mangerton.

CATHARINE'S, ST., v. LIBERTON. CATHARINE, ST., ofthe Hopes, v. GLENCROSS. CATHCART, partly in the Shire of Renfrew, and partly in the Under Ward, and Shire of Lanark: formerly a Vicarage, belonging to the Abbey of Paisley ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 108 bolls of meal, and 20 bolls of bear, with \u00a390. Scotch from the Vicarage Teinds, and an allowance of \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements : the manse is in bad repair : the glebe consists of about 4 acres: Patron, Mr. Gordon, of Aiken-Head: The Church was rebuilt in 1744, and has lately been thoroughly repaired. It is in the Presbytery of Glasgow, and Synod of GlasgoAv and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Villages of Cathcart, Langside, and West-Field,) was 1059, and, in 1811, was For that Part, Avhich is in the Shire of Renfrew - 1449. For that Part, Avhich is in the Shire of Lanark - 55. 1504. It is 3f m. S. from Glasgow. This Parish contains about 3000 Scotch acres, including the lands of Dripps, situate in the Shire of Lanark, and which were disjoined in 1725, by an amicable agreement of all the parties concerned : it was, however, expressly provided, that no matter of a Civil nature should be affected by this measure; the object being solely to accommodate the inhabitants of the lands of Dripps in Church privileges, who were much more contiguous to Carmunnock than their own Parish Church. The surface is beautifully diver-"], [331, "C A U sified; and the soil, is, in general, fertile, and Avell cultivated. Coals, and lime stone, are abundant. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees. This Parish gives both name, and title of Baron, Viscount, and Earl to the very Ancient and Noble family of Cathcart : By authentic records, of a very remote date, it appears, that the Ancestors ofthis great family were formerly persons of superior consequence and authority in the neighbour hood, and, it is probable, that the greatest part ofthe Parish was their property : but, being involved in difficulties by the troubles of the country (in which their Loyalty and Public Spirit always led them to take a distinguished share), about the year 1546, this, their ancient Hereditary estate, was alienated by Alan, the third Lord Cathcart; since which time they have had no possessions in the Parish, until the present Earl purchased the Farm on Avhich the old Castle stands, and a beautiful Villa on the South-East side of the river Cart. CATHER THUN, HILL, v. MENMUIR, and WHITE CATHER THUN. CATHKIN, HILL, v. CARMUNNOCK. CATLAW, one ofthe Grampian Mountains, situate in the Shire of Forfar.

CATRINE, in the District of Kyle, and Shire of Ayr: in the Parish of Sorn: Here is a Chapel of Ease. It is 2 m. E. b. S. from Mauchline. This is a large and improving Village, pleasantly situate on the Northern bank of the river Ayr; and owes its erection to Mr. Alexander, of Ballochmyle, the proprietor, in partnership with the av ell-known and patriotic Mr. David Dale, of Glasgow; Avho, in 1787, established an extensive Cotton manufactory here. CAT-STANE, v. KIRK-LISTON. CATTER, v. KILL-MARONOCK. CAULBIN, or COWBIN, v. DYKE. CAUSEA, or CAVE-SEA, in the Shire of Elgin; and in the Parish of Drainy. It is 1\\ m. N. b. W. from Elgin. It is a small fishing Village, on the Moray Firth. The Hill of Causea consists of one uninterrupted mass of free stone, more than a mile long, which is divided into horizontal strata of different degrees of thickness and hardness, but generally soft and friable. This hill forms a very bold shore ; and the violence of the winds and surge has excavated and torn the rock so, as to form many curious arches, caves, and pyramids: M m2"], [332, "CAV these rocks being coAered, in summer, with different kinds of plants of variegated colours, and birds in prodigious numbers, render the scenery exceedingly pic turesque and pleasing. CAVA, ISLE, one ofthe Orkneys; and constituting part of the Parish of Orphir, from Avhich it is two miles distant. This Island is a mile long, and about a quarter ofa mile broad, and is inhabited by three families. The soil is a mix ture of clay and moss, Avhich, as they have plenty of sea-Avare, seldom fails to produce a good crop. They have peats in abundance. The few inhabitants frequent the Parish Church, and are very regular in their attendance at Divine Worship. There is a ruinous Chapel in the Island, round which is a Church yard, Avhere they formerly used to bury their dead. It is remarked ofthis Island, and of some other small Islands adjacent, that neither rat nor mouse will live in them. Tliere was formerly a Salt-Pan here. CAVENS, CASTLE, v. PRESTON.

It is in the Presbytery of Jedburgh, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1382, and, in 1811, was 1402. It is 3| m. NE .b. E. from Hawick. This Parish is of great extent, being upwards of 20 miles in length from East to West, and from 2 to 7 miles in breadth. The appearance ofthe Western part ofthe Parish is hilly; and that ofthe Eastern, flat, Avith a rich fertile soil near the confluence of the Teviot, and Rule. The higher land is chiefly applied to the pasture of sheep, of Avhich considerable numbers are bred here. At the little Village of Denholm, on the estate of The Duke of Buccleugh, in the lower district of the Parish, the Cameronian Seceders have a Meeting-House. The brave and vir tuous Lord Heathfield, the gallant defender of Gibraltar, sprung from the Family of Stobs, now represented by Sir William Elliot, Bart., one ofthe prin cipal Heritors ofthis Parish. Cavers, the Seat of George Douglas, Esq., is an elegant Mansion. There are several ancient Camps in the upper part of this"], [333, "CER Parish: at Carlin-rigg , a number of Roman Urns were dug up some years ago: at Priest-Haugh, a great number of gold Coins were discovered, supposed to have been deposited there by some of the attendants of Queen Mary, in 1561, when she visited Earl Bothwell at The Hermitage Castle, aster his wound by John Elliot in Park : at a small wood, near Carlin-rigg Chapel, the famous John Armstrong was taken, and executed. The remains of the ancient British fortifi cation, called Catrail, may still be traced through this Parish, from South-West to North-West, towards Selkirk and Gallow Water. See, Hawick. The Wisp, one ofthe highest Hills in this Parish, rises about 1820 feet above the level of the Sea. Fast-Castle, the property of The Earl of Traquair, is a curious mound of earth, but whether natural or artificial, is uncertain; and upon which, till of late, there were several Houses; and, although, in the Parish of Cavers, it is situate so near the site ofthe Castle of Bedrule, as gives ground to some persons to suppose it to have been raised in ancient times, as an outwork to that fortress. CAVERTOWN, in the District of Kelso, and Shire of Roxburgh ; in the Parish of Eckford : There was formerly a Chapel, to the Eastward of the Village, but no vestige of it now remains; a small Church-yard is still occupied in sepulture by some families in the Parish, whose ancestors had privilege tliere; and a Spring, in the adjacent field, North of the Church-yard, now bears the appellation of Tlte Holy or Priest's Well. It is 4f m. S. from Kelso. On Ca vertown Edge, the annual Horse Races of Kelso are run, and are well attended. Some antiquities have been discovered here. CAWDOR, v. CALDER. CEANN-LOCH, v.

Scotch was for merly payable to the Chaplain, from certain Houses in Cupar, but these Houses cannot now be discovered, and the Chaplainry has become a Title Avithout a Benefice. It is in the Presbytery of Cupar, and Synod of Fife. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 2352, and, in 1811, was 2407. It is 2-j- m. S. S. E. from Cupar of Fife. The Fairs are holden on the 24th-of June, and 20th of October, and considerable numbers of horses and cattle are sold at them. This Parish contains about 8000 acres. The soil on the banks of the Eden, and the burn of Ceres, is light and sandy : but, at a distance, is a deep cold earth, on a rocky bottom. The surface is hilly ; but the hills are cultivated to their summits, and agriculture is much attended to here. Coals, lime-stone, and free-stone, are abundant. The climate is temperate, and healthy. The Salary of the Parochial School is 400 merks Scotch, together with School-fees. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. Struthers, an ancient House of The Earls of Crawfurd, is now in ruins : and here, that branch of the Noble family of Lindsay, distinguished by the title of Byres, which, after first attaining the title of Earl of Lindsay, acquired also that of Crawfurd, had its chief resi dence, for about tAvo Centuries preceding the year 1774 : this branch of the Lindsay family has produced many eminent Statesmen ancl Soldiers. Upon the estate of Scot's-Tervit or Tarvet, now the property of James Balfour Wemyss, Esq., is a beautiful Tower of jointed free-stone, 24 feet square, and about 60 feet high ; and which appears to have been intended for a place of strength. Craig Hall, now in ruins, was formerly the Seat of Sir Thomas Hope, from whom the principal families of the name of Hope in Scotland are de scended. Magus Moor is remarkable for being the scene of the death of Arch bishop Sharp, who Avas killed on his way from Ceres to St. Andrew's, in the year 1679. David Lindsay, of Pitscottie, author ofthe History of Scotland from 1437 to 1542, was a native of this Parish, and proprietor ofa small estate here, where he died in 1593, aged 66. CESSFORD, in the District of Kelso, and Shire of Roxburgh ; in the Parish of Eckford. This is a small Village, in Teviotdale: and near it, are the remains of the ancient Castle of Cessford, which gives Title of Baron to the Illustrious Family of Ker, Duke of Roxburgh. This Village was burnt by The Marquis of Dorset, Warden of the East and Middle Marches, in 1522. It is"], [335, "CHA 6| m. N. E. from Jedburgh. At the distance of a few yards from the Castle, is an Ash Tree of a remarkable size, called The Crow Tree; it is of great antiquity, and has often been A'isited and admired by the curious. CESSNOCK, CASTLE, v. GALSTON. CHANCE INN, in the Shire of Forfar; and in the Parish of Inver-Keilor. It is 63| m. N. N. E. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Offie is established here. CHANNEL-KIRK, properly CHILDIN-KIRK, i. e. The Church at the Fort, in the Shire of Berwick : formerly a Rectory, with the ancient Chapels of Glen gelt and Carfrae annexed ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3600. Scotch, 3 chalders of victual, one-half oats, the other half barley, and a glebe of nearly 9 English acres, but being in two detached parts, and the whole uninclosed, it is of very little value to the Minister: the manse, and offices, were rebuilt about 20 years ago, and are now in good repair: Patrons, The Trustees of The Earl of Marchmont : The Church, which is built in the form of a Cross, underwent a thorough repair, in 1702. It is in the Presbytery of Lauder, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 640, and, in 1811, was 707. It is 6 m. N. N. W. from Lauder. The Church, and Village, stand within the area ofa Roman Camp. This Parish is 6 miles in length, and nearly 5h miles in breadth. The surface is in general hilly, par ticularly to the West and North, where the Parish is bounded by a high ridge of hills, which divides the Counties of East and Mid-Lothian from the Shire of Berwick. The hills are mostly bleak, and covered with heath. On the banks of the streamlets, which, united, form the river Lauder or Leader, are about 2000 acres in tillage, having a light thin soil, on a deep bed of sandy graA'el. From its elevated situation, and the light dry nature ofthe soil, the climate is remarkably healthy ; it is, however, for six months of the year, extremely cold, being subject to severe frosts, and great falls of snow. Peats, and turf, of which there are plenty in the Parish, were formerly the only fuel used by the inhabit ants : but, since the public roads were made, and kept in good repair, coals, although brought from a distance of 12 miles, are found by the Proprietors and Farmers to be, upon the whole, the cheapest fuel. Here are a few memorials of Popery * about a quarter ofa mile West from the Kirk, is a spring of excel lent soft water, called The Well of The Holy Water Cleugh. The Girthgate, that is, the road which the Monks kept in their Avay from Melros Abbey to Edin burgh, passes through the Western boundary ofthe Parish : it is a broad green"], [336, "CHA Path, on which the surrounding heath never groAvs : on this road, a few miles due West from the Church, are to be seen the ruins of an old building commonly known by the name of The Resh Law, or Restlaic Haw ; tradition says, that this was the place where the Monks and Pilgrims stopped, or rested for refresh ment, it being* about half-Avay betAveen Melros and Edinburgh. A great many Pictish or Scottish military encampments are to be seen in this Parish, and the neighbourhood ; they are all of a round or oval figure, and are commonly called Rings. General Roy has preserved a plan of the Roman Camp here, pi. 6., Avhich he supposes to have been formed by Agricola. CHANONRY, v. ROSEMARKIE. CHAPEL, and CHAPEL PARK, *>. LILLIES-LEAF CHAPEL GILL, v. GLEN-HOLM. CHAPEL GREEN, in the Shire of Stirling ; and in the Parish of Killsyth : The Chapel is demolished. It is almost in the centre of the West Barony. Here is a School, Avhich was erected in the year 1723, on the site of the ancient Chapel, in consequence of a donation of \u00a360. Sterling from Mr. John Patrick, Merchant in London, and a native ofthis Parish. That Sum, according to the terms ofthe Donation, was devoted to the purpose of building the School, and endowing the Teacher with a yearly Salary not exceeding \u00a33. Sterling, in order that he might be enabled to teach the poor Scholars gratis. The Session are nominated Trustees of the Fund, under the inspection of the Presbytery ; and they are likeAvise Patrons ofthe School.

The Aveekly Market is discontinued ; but its Fairs are still holden on the third Wednesday, O. S., in June, the first Tuesday, O. S., in October, and the second Wednesday, N. S., in November. CHARLES-TOWN, in the District of Dunfermlin, and Shire of Fife : in the Parish of Dunfermlin. It is 2| m. S. b. W. from Dunfermlin. This is a thriving Village, pleasantly situate on the Northern bank of the Firth of Forth, and has a tolerable Harbour. It was built by the late Charles Earl of Elgin, in 1778, for the accommodation of the workmen, at the extensive Lime-works on his estate, and takes its name accordingly from His Lordship. CHARLETON, v. MONTROSE. CHARLEY'S WELL, v. KIRK-CONNEL. CHARTER-HOUSE, v. PERTH. CHARTERS-HALL, or CHATORS HALL, in the Shire of Stirling; and in the Parish of St. Ninian's.

N n"], [338, "C H R the Out-offices have also been re-built, some years ago: Patron, William Hall, Esq., of Whitehall: The Church is very ancient, and is in tolerable condition. It is in the Presbytery of Chirnside, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, Avas 1147, and, in 1811, was 1239. It is 6 m. NE. b. E. from Dunse. This Parish contains about 6523 acres of Land. The surface is flat, with the exception of Chirnside- Hill, from whence the prospect is very extensive and beautiful: the soil is a rich loam, well culti vated, and the Farmers are a most respectable and well informed body of men. A species of gypsum, nearly equal in quality to the finest brought from France, is found on the banks of the Whittadder, in very considerable quantities, and has been used as manure to great advantage. Here are several mineral springs, strongly impregnated with iron. The two Estates of Chirnside, and Idington, are separate Baronies, and both of considerable antiquity. After the forfeiture of The Earl of Dunbar, in 1434, the Barony of Chirnside appears to have come into the Family of Home. The Lands of Nine- Wells, the property of Joseph Home, Esq., appear, from charters, not to hold of the Barony of Chirnside, but ofthe Lordship of Home. The Estate, called East Mains, holds of the Barony of Chirnside, and is the property of John Molle, Esq., a lineal descendant of an old family of that name at Morbotle, in Teviotdale. The Barony of Idington, in the beginning ofthe Eighteenth century, was then possessed by a Sir Andreav Lauder, ofthe Valley field Family ; but has been now, for above Sixty years, the property ofthe Hays, of Drummelzier, Avhose present Representative is Robert Hay, Esq., resident at Dunse Castle, the usual seat of his Family. There are several Cairns in this Parish: and, upon the Chester-Knows, are the remains ofa Roman encampment, and where the grinder ofa Roman moletrina or hand-mill was lately discoA'ered. As a Burgh of Barony, it has the Privilege of holding an annual Fair, chiefly for the sale of sackcloth and linen yarn, on the last Thursday in November. The air is pure, and healthy. David Hume, the celebrated Historian, Avas bred up here from his infancy, and he never considered himself as an alien, from the accidental locality of his birth at Edinburgh. CHRIST'S KIRK, in the District of Alford, and Shire of Aberdeen: an ancient Parish, now annexed to the Parish of Kinnethmont : The Church is in ruins, but the Burial-ground is still in use. It is 4 m. E. from Clatt. A Fair was formerly kept here on the Green, in the month of May, and in the night; from which circumstance, it was commonly called Sleepy Market. Some years ago, the Propietor (General Hay, of Rannes) changed it from night to day; but so strong"], [339, "C L A was the prepossession ofthe people in favour ofthe old custom, that rather than comply Avith the alteration, they chose to neglect it altogether. The scene of the celebrated Poem of\" Chryst' s-Kirk on the Grene', commonly ascribed to James the First, King of Scotland, is supposed to have been here. CHRYSTONE, in the Under Ward, and Shire of Lanark; in the Parish of Calder : A Chapel of Ease was lately built here by subscription, but there is no Salary annexed to it. It is 7 m. N.

CLACHAN, or KIRK-TOWN, v. RAA SAY, ISLAND. CLACHAN DYSART, v. GLEN URCHAY. CLACH-NA-HERRY, in the Shire of Inverness ; and in the Parish of Inverness. This is a small Fishing Village ; which is said to derive its name Clach-na-Herry , i. e. The Watch Stone, from a large stone near it, and on which Centinels were placed, to give intelligence to the Inhabitants of Inver ness, during the state of hostility between them and the neighbouring rebellious Chieftains and their Clans. The Great Caledonian Canal unites here with the Moray Firth. In 1341, there was a conflict here between John Monro, Tutor of Foulis, and the powerful Chief of Mackintosh, in which the latter, with many of his forces, were slain. CLACKMANNAN, in the Shire of Clackmannan : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. Sterling, with \u00a38.. 6 .8. for Communion ele- ments, and\u00a320. Scotch for grass mail; together with a glebe of about 4acres of good land, and what is called Craig leave coal, that is, free coal, except paying the col- liers' wages, which are about one-third part ofthe value : the manse was built in 1740, in a beautiful situation : Patron, Lord Dundas : The Church is an old mean structure, in the form ofa Cross, and is now in a very ruinous state. It is in the Presbytery of Stirling, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Popu- lation ofthis Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 2961, and, in 1811, Avas 3605. It is 29 m. NW. b. W. from Edinburgh. A Fair is holden here in the month of June, and another in September, called Bartholomew's Fair, for cattle, linen and woollen cloth, and hardware. It is beautifully situate on an eminence, gently rising out ofa plain, about 190 feet above the level of the Forth. On each side of the Village, the ground has a gradual descent, but, towards the West, it is Nn2"], [340, "C L A more bold and rocky, and on its summit is the old Tower of Clackmannan ; from whence the scenery is uncommonly picturesque, and has been vieAved with ad miration by every traveller of taste. The Village itself, however, by no means corresponds Avith the beauty of its situation : the principal street is broad and regular, but many of the houses are mean and Avretched. The Sheriff sometimes holds his Courts here ; the County Fiars are annually struck at this place : and here the Mehibers of Parliament for the County have always been elected. The Village is situate on the estate of Clackmannan, and pays feu-duty to the pro prietor of that estate : the owners of this Estate were also Heritable Sheriffs of this County, and, on the abolition of Hereditary Jurisdictions in 1747, laid their claim at a considerable sum. The Parish of Clackmannan contains 7 132 acres ; of Avhich, upwards of 700 acres are covered, with natural woods and plantations : a cold clay soil, with a wet bottom, predominates over a great part of the Par ish ; but on the banks ofthe Forth, are 1000 acres of excellent carse soil, all very fertile. Agriculture is much attended to, and is indebted for many improvements to The Clackmannanshire Farmer Club. It is bounded by the Forth, on the South ; Avhich is here a mile in breadth, and of a depth sufficient for very large vessels. There are two Pows or Creeks, \u2014 Clackmannan Pow on the Western boundary, and that of Kennet Pans towards the East, about a mile and a half dis tant from each other, both of which are in the district ofthe Port of Alloa. The Pow of Clackmannan is formed by the mouth ofthe river Black Devon ; its mean depth of water at the usual shipping-place is 10 feet, and at the entrance ofthe harbour, 20 feet : in 1772, it was much improved by Sir Laurence Dundas : There wss formerly a Salt-pan here. Coals, and lime-stone, abound in every part of the Parish, and are worked to a great extent ; there is also plenty of free-stone. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and a good house and garden. There are likeAvise five other Schools established in different parts ofthe Parish ; one of Avhich was taught by Michael Bruce, the ingenious Poet ofthe Shire of Kinross, whose premature death is so pathetically, and so justly lamented, by the elegant Author of The Mirror, No. 36. The estate of Clack mannan, belonging to Lord Dundas, is strictly entailed ; as is also the estate belonging to Mr. Erskine, of Marr. Clackmannan has, for many generations, been the Seat ofthe Chief of the Bruces, in Scotland : and the old Tower, which still remains, and of which Mr. Grose has preserved a view, is said to have been built by King Robert Bruce. Henry Bruce, Esq., the last Laird"], [341, "C L A Of Clackmannan, died in 1772 j and in him ended the direct line of that Ancient Family: The Claimants for the Chiefship are, The Earl of Elgin, and Alex ander Bruce, Esq., of Kennet. On the banks ofthe Devon, is another old Tower, belonging to Earl Cathcart ; it has been for many years in the posses sion of that Noble Family, and is still more entire than the Tower of Clack mannan. There was also another Tower, at a place called Hart-Shaw, which belonged originally to the Stewarts, of Rosyth from which Family Oliver Cromwell, by the female line, is said to have been descended. CLACKMANNAN, SHIRE. This is a very small County, being only about 9 miles in length, and 8 miles in breadth. Towards the Forth, it is plain and fertile, producing abundance of corn, as well as pasture: and the coast possesses several valuable and safe harbours for ships, and creeks for the reception of boats employed in the fisheries. From the shore, the surface rises into the Ocltil Mountains, which abound with coals, freestone, and granite. The Resident Population of this Shire, in 1801, was 10,858, and, in 181 1, Avas 12,010. This little Shire, with that of Kinross, alternately elect a Member, their mutual Represen tative. Considerable improAements in agriculture have lately been made here.

It is a free Burgh of Barony, erected by James the Fourth, in 1501, Avith power to hold a weekly Market on Tuesday, and annual Fairs, for eight days. The Superiority belongs to the family of Gordon, of Knockespock, who have done every tiring in their power to render it a place of consequence. A General Post- Office is established here. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a rood of land. This Parish is"], [342, "C L E situate very high, being surrounded Avith lofty hills, and subject to be deluged with heavy rains : the soil is in general of an excellent quality, but the produce is precarious from the inclemency ofthe seasons. The public roads are in toler able repair. The estate of Knockespock comprehends about three-fourths of the Parish ; and of late, the family have resided a considerable part of the year there.

This Parish contains about 5000 acres ; of which, 1450 are arable : the soil is, in general, deep and fertile ; and considerable improvements in agriculture have been introduced by the patriotic exertions of Mr. Adam, of Maryburgh. The air is rather moist, but not un healthy. There are four Lakes among the Hills, the largest of which is about a mile and a half in circumference : they all abound with pike, perch, eels, and some trout. Here is great plenty of excellent free-stone. The Salary ofthe"], [343, "C L I Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a house and garden. The fuel commonly used is coal and peat ; with both of which the inhabitants are well supplied. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. Personal Services are only performed by one tenant. Upon several ofthe hills, are the remains of ancient fortifications, which are supposed to be Roman: the most remarkable of them is upon the summit of Dr umg low, the highest hill in the Parish, or in the neighbourhood : and, about a mile to the Northward of it, inthe low ground, severnl Urns were discovered in the year 1791. A small part of the Parish of Dunfermlin is annexed to Cleish, quoad sacra. CLELAND, in the Middle Ward, and Shire of Lanark ; in the Parish of Bothwell. Upon the Northern bank ofthe Calder, in the middle of the steep rock on which the House of Cleland stands, is a large natural Cave, Avhich had been greatly improved by art, and used as a retreat, during the violent feuds be tween the Clelands of Cleland, and the Muirheads of Lauchope; and especially in the convulsions ofthis country under the Charles's. Near the site ofthe old Castle, the late Marton Dalrymple, Esq., erected a handsome modern House, which is now occupied by his widow and children.

The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, Avas 1679, and, in 1811, Avas 1762. It is 2| m. S. S. E. from Thornhill. The Parish of Closeburn is quite sur rounded by the Parish of Dalgarno ; the extent ofthe two United Parishes being from 9 to 10 miles in length, and the same in breadth ; and containing by mea surement about 28,000 acres; of which, 1900 are arable. Along the river Nith, which forms the Western boundary of the Parish, the soil is a fine rich loam ; to the Eastward, the ground rises a little, and the soil becomes light, dry, and sandy ; Avhilst the Eastern district is still more elevated, with extensive moors, that are unfit for tillage, but afford excellent pasture for sheep. Peat is abundant ; and, although coals are obliged to be brought from Sanquhar, at the distance of 14 miles, yet the lime-AVorks of Closeburn are carried on to a very great extent, and have proved very beneficial to the County. There are about 200 acres of natural wood, and about 300 acres of thriving plantations. This Parish is remarkably well supplied Avith Schools, though tliere is no legal Salary provided for a School-master : the proprietor of Closeburn has, for many years, given a small sum annually to a person named by himself, to teach English, Avriting, and arithmetic ; but the principal one is that, which, in honour of its founder, John Wallace, in 1723, is called The School of Wallace Hall; and which has acquired a v*ery high and justly merited reputation, for the great attention paid to the morals and education of the Scholars, by the late and present amiable and indefatigable Rector, The Rev. Alexander Mundell. The situation is healthy. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. The principal Hills are those of Queensberry, Garrick Heights, and Auchinleck ; and from the first of them, which is elevated about 2000 feet above the level of the sea, The Marquis (late Duke) of Queensberry takes his title ; but only one half of it is His Lordship's property. Upon the Farm of Kirk Patrick, there are the remains of an old Chapel and Burying-ground : and upon the Farm of"], [345, "C L U Auchen-Cairn, there are the \\'estiges of an old vaulted building : but there is ne traditionary account Avith respect to either of them : there are likewise, in different parts of the Parish, several large cairns. In the Loch, contiguous to the Castle, there was an extraordinary agitation ofthe Avater in the year 1756, of which a description is given in the Philosophical Transactions, vol.49. part 2. p. 521. The Castle of Closeburne is, perhaps, the oldest inhabited Tower in the South of Scotlmd : it formerly belonged, together with the whole Parish, to the very ancient and respectable Family of Kirkpatrick, in whose possession it remained for several centuries : by a Charter, the original of Avhich is inthe possession of Sir James Kirkpatrick, Bart., it appears, that Ivon de Kirkpatrick, of Klosburne, obtained a confirmation ofthe lands of Klosburne, granted to his ancestors, from Alexander the Second, in 1232. To satisfy the demands of importunate Creditors, the estate of Closeburn was exposed to sale in the year 1783, and was bought by The Rev. James Stuart Monteith, A. M., Rector of BarroAvby, in the County of Lincoln, the Heir male and Representative ofthe ancient Earls of Monteith of that surname ; who has since built himself a handsome Seat near the Castle, in the midst of a beautiful plantation. Mr. Grose has preserved a View ofthis Castle. CLOVA, v. KILLDRUMMY. CLOVA, in the Shire of Forfar: an ancient Parish, annexed to the. Parish of Cortachy: The Church Avas rebuilt in 1730, and is about 9 miles distant from the Church of Cortachy. The inhabited part of Clova is about 4 miles in length, and its greatest breadth is little more than a mile. It is surrounded on three sides by the Grampian Mountains, whieh are here of great height, and exhibit a scene of much beauty and grandeur, especially when contrasted with a delightful valley at their base. Loch Brandy is about a mile and a half in circumference, and abounds with pike, and trout. On a little eminence, near the Church, are the remains of an ancient Castle, formerly the residence of a family of the name of Ogilvy. The Honourable Walter Ogilvy is sole Pro prietor of Clova, but has no residence here. See, Cortachy. CLOVEN STONE, v. MOY. CLUNE, v. CARNOCK. CLUNE, EASTER, and WESTER, r. BIRSE. CLUNES, v.

This Parish contains about 8000 acres; of which, about 2550 are under tillage; the remainder being mountain, and bleak moor. The climate is healthy. Ben-Ach ally is the highest mountain: at the foot of which, on its North side, in the Forest of Clunie (said to have been once a Royal Forest, and now the property of The Duke of Athol) is a Loch of the same name, about a mile long, and half a mile broad ; and which abounds with trout. The Loch of Clunie is about 2\\ miles in circumference, having a beautiful little Island, on which is an old Castle, in good repair, and the occasional residence of The Earl of Airly, who is Superior ofthe Loch, Proprietor ofthe Barony of Clunie, and Principal Heritor of the Parish: this Lake abounds with pike, perch, trout, and eels, all of a large size. The Castle of Clunie was built about the beginning ofthe 16th Century, by George Brown, Bishop of Dunkeld, and was one of his favourite Seats; but what adds to its celebrity, it is said to be the birth place ofthe Admirable Crichton, whose adventures on the Continent make so distinguished a figure in the annals of Literature. Game, of various kinds, are in plenty. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a good School-house. Peats are abundant. There are vestiges of Chapels and Ceme teries at Gourdie, Chapelton, Chapelhill, and in the Park of Laighwood; and, on the Island ofthe Loch of Clunie, a place of Worship, dedicated to St. Cathe rine, stood on the spot now occupied by The Earl of Airly's kitchen. Here are also the remains of several Military Stations, and a great number of cairns and tumuli, Avhich are said to mark the places Avhere the Romans under Agricola, and the Caledonians engaged, as described by Tacitus. The Roads are bad. The old oppressive customs of bonnage , thirlage, and servitudes, \" disgraceful to the country, and to humanity\", are not yet quite abolished.

It is in the Presbytery of Kincardine O'Neil, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 821, and, in 1811, was 823. It is 1*| m. S. from Monymusk. This Parish contains about 6933 acres; of which, about three-fifths are in cultivation. The surface is low and level, except towards the West, where there is a mountain, called The Forest of Conainy, which is now destitute of wood : the Dominium directum, as it is termed, belongs to The Duke of Gordon, but the Dominium utile belongs to his vassals all around, who, by their charters, have a right to fuel and pasturage in it. The soil is warm and dry, and abundantly productive. Fuel is expensive. The only manufacture here is the knitting of stockings. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a rood ofland. The Castle of Cluny, a large edifice, was built in the beginning of the Fifteenth Cen tury by Sir Alexander Gordon, a son of the Huntley family, and is now the occasional residence of The Honourable Baron G ordon : Castle Frazer Avas also built in the beginning of the Fifteenth Century, by Andrew Lord Frazer, and is the Seat of Miss Frazer : Both of these Proprietors are carrying on very ex tensive improvements on their respective estates.

The inhabited part ofthis Parisii is about 24 miles in length, and from 4 to 8 miles in breadth. It is situate on the German Ocean, from whence the shore rises gradually to the Mountains. Agriculture is little understood here. The climate is pure, and Avholesome. There is a tolerable harbour, for boats and small vessels, at the mouth of the river Brora ; Salt-pans were formerly Avorked there ; and of late, the spinning of lint has been introduced into the Village. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, and perquisites. Loch Brora is a beautiful sheet of Avater, extending 4 miles in length, and nearlv a mile in breadth, and abounds with salmon, char, and trouts of different kinds : near it, on both sides, are lofty mountains, at the feet of which are some beautiful Vil lages, and several extensive natural AA'oods, chiefly belonging to the family of Gordon, of Carrall. It is pleasant to add, that Captain Richard Franks, an honest Cavalier, and author of\" Northern Memoirs,\" Lond. 1694, 12mo.,made a journey, during the Usurpation, from the banks of the Trent as far as the Avater of Brora to enjoy, as he travelled, the amusement of Angling.

It is in the Presbytery of Dunbar, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 930, and, in 1811, was 904. It is 8 m. N. W. from Press. The Fair is holden on the second Tuesday in August. This Parish, Avhich is situate near the German Ocean, consists of two parts; one, high and mountainous, the other, comparatively low and even : the upper divi sion makes part ofthe Lammer-Muir Hills, which approach within three miles ofthe shore towards the West; the lower division, on the Sea-coast, is light and sandy, interspersed with fields of rich deep clay. The shore is high, presenting a set of cliffs about 100 feet above the level of the sea : behind the cliffs the"], [350, "coe ground rises gently toAvards the hills, having many deep dens or ravines, whose sides are sometimes sloping and covered with verdure, but the general appearance is rocky, with overhanging woods ; and in each of them runs a little brook. Over one of these ravines is thrown the Peas Bridge, planned and executed by Mr. Henderson, in 1786, Avhich is esteemed a master-piece of architecture. About Dunglass, the Seat of Sir James Hall, Bart., there is a great deal of fine wood : and Avhose father, about 60 years ago, made an attempt to clear a bason, and form a harbour at the mouth ofa small rivulet, called The Cove : but, after the Avork Avas considerably adAanced, it was destroyed by a storm, and has never been renewed ; a road had been cut through a rock, for an easy access to the shore, by which carts still pass under ground about 60 yards. The Herring-fishing here is sometimes very successful. The Roads are good. Fuel is scarce, and expensive. The Salary of the established Schoolmaster is 300 merks, with a dAvelling-house, School-house, and garden, besides School-fees, and about \u00a31.. 15.. 0. Sterling, the perquisites as Session Clerk. On the Western bank ofthe Ewis-Bum, about a mile South-East from the Church, are the ruins of the ToAver of Colbrand's-Path, now called The Old Tower ; and which appears to have been a place of great strength. The Earldom of Dunbar, and the Lord ship of Colbrand's-Path, were settled by James the Fourth on the Princess Margaret, as a part of her Dower. Tradition talks of Colerand, a Danish General, who performed some gallant action here. There is a Hamlet, at the top ofthe ascent, by that particular path, called Path-Head. Mr. Grose has presen'ed a view of Cockburn's-Path Tower, and also one ofthe Peaths, or Pease Bridge. This bridge lies OA'er a vast chasm, in some parts more than 160 feet deep. OA*er this steep Pass, the magnificent bridge, of four arches, was built in 1786 : its height from the surface ofthe water to the top of the railing, is 123 feet ; it is 300 feet in length, 15 feet in width, and is 200 feet in rise of the hill, above Avhere the old Bridge stood, only at a quarter ofa mile East, towards the sea. Its romantic situation, and stupendous height, afford matter of curiosity to travellers. But its utility for military and commercial purposes, betwixt South and North Britain, also for facilitating the improvement and agriculture of Berwickshire, are objects of the first importance, and noAv attained with ease. COCKENZIE, in the Shire of Hadington; and in the Parish of Tranent. A Village, situate on the Firth of Forth, at the distance of 2 miles N.N.W. from Tranent. At the end ofthe Sixteenth Century, James the Sixth created,"], [351, "coe in favour of Robert Lord Seaton, the Burgh of Barony of Cockenzie, to be holden as a free Port. The Village of Cockenzie is close to the town of Port Seaton, where the Harbour now is: it lies within the Custom-House Port of Preston Pans. Here is a manufacture of common Salt, carried on to great ad vantage and extent, there being always eleven or twelve Pans at work. A Fair is holden here annually, on the first Thursday of November.

It is in the Presbytery of Dalkeith, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 1681, and, in 1811, Avas 2000. It is 2\\ m. S. from Dalkeith. This Parish is about 2 miles in length, and one mile and a half in breadth: the soil is a strong clay, which is very fertile, and in general Avell cultivated. The climate is dry, and healthy. Coal, and lime stone, abound in every part of the Parish, and are worked to a great extent. There is a Flax manufactory at Kirk-Hill. The roads are tolerable. The river South Esk divides the Southern part ofthe Parish; the banks of which are bold, and beautifully covered with natural wood ; and over it is thrown an elegant Bridge at the Village. The Parish of Cockpen has consisted from the Twelfth century to the present time, ofthe Barony of Dalhousie, a corruption of Dalwolsie, Avhich com prehended the lands of Cockpen, and indeed the Avhole Parish. The Patronage ofthe Church belonged anciently to the Ramsays, of Dalwolsie, one ofthe oldest and most respectable Families of Mid -Lothian : and by whom the lands of Cock pen were given to the Monks of Newbottle. After the Reformation, the lands of Cockpen were granted, with the other estates of Newbottle Abbey, to Mark Ker, Lord Newbottle. In May 1609, his son Robert, the second Earl of Lothian, was served heir to him in the Lands and Collieries of Cockpen, within the Barony of Dalhousie. These lands were asterAvard sold to Mr. Baron Cockburn, of Cockpen: and about thirty years ago, the same lands were, by purchase, re-annexed to the Barony of Dalhousie. In May 1542, James the Fifth granted to Nicol de Ramsay, of Dalivolsie, a power of Justiciary over his lands of Dalwolsie, and Carington, in the Shire of Edinburgh, and of Foulden, in the Shire of Berwick: but this Power seems to have expired with himself, in"], [352, "COL 1554. The Castle of Dalhousie, the Seat ofthe Ancient and Noble family os Ramsay, Earls of Dalhousie, is a building of great antiquity, and is pleasantly situate on the Northern bank of the river Esk, which Aoavs at a few yards dis tance from the foot ofthe walls: but it was modernised by the late Earl, and has thereby lost much of its former venerable aspect: the grounds are Avell laid out, and highly ornamented. A few bare Avails are now all that remain ofthe once hospitable Mansion of Cockpen. Mr. Grose has preserved two Views of the Castle. COCKPOOL, CASTLE, v. RUTHWELL. COCKSTOWN, v. LLAN BRIDE.

It is in the Pres bytery of Chirnside, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Popula tion ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 2391, and,.in 1811, was 2424. It is 2 m. E. from Press. The Fairs are holden on the 25th of July, and 24th of October. This Parisii is about seven miles in length, and ofthe same extent in breadth ; and is principally inclosed, except a Common moor, Avhich contains above 600 English acres, of a very poor quality. The general appearance is flat; but there is a considerable portion of rising grounds, of easy ascent and gentle declivity, which are, for the most part, accessible to the plough, and are of a rich, fertile .soil. There are several peat mosses, but the peats want that solidity which renders this sort of fuel fit for fires; and, indeed, the greatest disadvantage which this Parish labours under, is the distance from coals, being 14 miles from the collieries in Northumberland, from whence it is supplied. The river Eye Aoavs through the Parish, Avhich abounds with trout of an excellent quality, though generally small. About a mile West from St. Abb's Head, is a beautiful Lake of clear water, called Coldingham Loch; it is of a triangular figure, about a mile in"], [353, "COL circumference, and is very deep: the only fish in it are perch. The extent of Sea coast, in this Parish, is about 6 miles from the Parish of Eyemouth to that of Cockbum's-Path ; and upon this part of the Coast, the Promontory of St. Abb's Head is situate, about Avhich, and on the Westward of it, the shore is dangerous and inaccessible, except at Lumsden Shore, where there are several Fishing boats ; on the EastAvard of St. Abb's Head, a considerable part of the shore is smooth and of easy access, particularly at Coldingham Sands, and the Farm of Norlhfield, Avhere there are also several Fishing-boats ; but there is no harbour for ships in this Parish: great plenty, and variety of fish are caught here. The Town of Coldingham, which is of great antiquity, stands in a retired dry Valley, having a small rivulet of excellent water running upon each side of it, and is about a mile distant from the German Ocean. Before the spirit of improving land had begun to appear here, there were four considerable Villages besides the Town of Coldingham, viz., Renton, Auchencraw, and the two Prestons ; but since that period, the heritors have built good Farm-steads upon the most cen tral parts of their out-fields ; hence, the Villages of Renton and East Preston have disappeared; and Auchencraw and West Preston have dwindled to less than half the size they were before the new system of agriculture was introduced,' and with so much success. Besides the Church of Ayton, Avhich was formerly a subordinate Chapel to the Mother Church of Coldingham, there was a Chapel on St. Abb's Head; part of the side walls whereof are now standing ; prodigious numbers of Sea-fowls breed annually, upon the high and inaccessible rocks on the South side of this Promontory. Fast Castle is situate upon an eminence close to the Sea, on the North West Corner of this Parish : it is noAv completely in ruins : from the steepness ofthe rocks upon which it stood, it must have been inaccessible on all parts, except by a narrow neck or entry from the land, of a few feet in breadth: In 1410, during hostilities between the two Kingdoms, Patrick Dunbar, one of the younger sons of The Earl of March, accompanied by a hundred resolute men, took this fortress by surprise in the night : the Governor, Thomas Holden, who, by his continual excursions, had long infested the adjacent country, being made prisoner. On the 10th of January 1513-14, Fast Castle, Lord Home's chief forties, Avas directed \" to be provided Avith men, artillery, and victual\": in 1549, it Avas again taken by surprise by the Scots : and, in 1570, it surrendered to Sir William Drury : At the date of The Earl of Gowrie's con spiracy, it belonged to Logan, of Restalrig g ; whose fate, or rather that of his family, is so well known : several years aster he vvas in his grave, he was tried vol i. Pp"], [354, "COL and condemned, and his Avhole estates Avere forfeited, and bestowed upon the then Earl of Dunbar, for his having been engaged in Goavrie's treason: a silly person ofthe name of Sprot, a Notary in Eyemouth, produced some treasonable letters that passed betAveen Goavrie, and Logan, and he was rewarded by being hanged at Edinburgh Cross. There Avas a Forties or Family Castle at Renton, another at Houndwood, one at West Preston, and one at East Preston, in which the Proprietors of those Estates resided: they have all been demolished, about a century ago, and the stones and materials applied to other purposes. The only Camp Avhich noAv appears to have been in this Parish, is that upon the height, called Warlaw, on the Westward of Auchencraw : it is of an oval form, and comprises five or six acres of very poor moor land ; both history and tradition are silent about it. The Roads are in good condition. The Priory of Coldingham was formerly a Nunnery, and is said to have been the oldest Nunnery in Scot land; neither its founder, the time of its foundation, nor its Order, are known : but it occurs in history as early as the year 661; at which time Abbe, or Ebba, sister to Osy, King of Northumberland, was Abbess/and entertained St. Cuthbert, then Prior of Melros, here for several days : in the year 669 Etheldreda, Queen of Egfred, King of Northumberland, became a Nun ofthis House. In the year 709, this Monastery was burned, as was said, by accident; though it was gener ally supposed to have been a punishment from Heaven, inflicted on the Monks and Nuns for their wicked lives. It seems as if this Monastery laid desolate till the year 1098, when it was resounded by Edgar, King of Scotland, in honour of St. Cuthbert, and silled Avith Benedictine Monks from Durham, to which place it \u25a0was made dependant. The last Commendator was John Stuart, son of Francis, Earl of Bothavell. In 1544, in an incursion made by the English, they seized this Priory, and fortified the Church and Steeple. In 1594, on the forfeiture of The Earl of Bothwell's estates, the Lordship of Coldingham was given to Lord Home, in whose family it still remains. The original Charters belonging to this House are still extant in the Archives ofthe Cathedral of Durham. Ofthis Priory the chief remains are part of the Church, consisting of a single Aisle. The South side and West end were re-built about the year 1670, as appears by the initials and date. The roof is covered Avith lead, the ceiling is boarded. The windows at the East end are circular, and decorated with the zig-zag orna ment. On the inside ofthe South wall are tvt*o stories of pointed arches. Mr. Grose has preserved three views of it. COLDRA1N, or COLLINS DRAINS, in the Shire of Perth; and in the"], [355, "COL Parish of Fossaway. On this Barony is a place, called Hall- Yard, being* an ob long square, with the corners a little rounded: and within its area once stood a building, Avhich, according to tradition, was a Hunting-seat of the Earls of Athol. It now belongs to James Stedman, Esq., of Wh infield, near Kinross. In 1609, the whole lands of the Barony were exposed to sale, in consequence of a debt due from The Earl of Athol to Sir David Hermy, of Leithindy, when the tenants, who either held their lands by lease, or wadsett, appeared, and became the purchasers. The greatest part of these lands still belongs in property to the descendants of the original purchasers, but the Superiority is vested in Mr. Stedman. COLDSTONE, in the District of Kincardine O'Neil, and Shire of Aberdeen: formerly a Rectory, belonging to the Chapter of Aberdeen, with the Parish of Logie annexed, in 1618; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 111 bolls of victual, 32 of which are bear, \u00a345. .2. .1., and two glebes: the manse was re-built in 1783: Patrons, The Crown, and James Farquharson, Esq., of Invercauld, alter nately: The Church Avas re-built in 1780. It is in the Presbytery of Kincardine O'Neil, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population ofthe United Par ishes, in 1801, was 861, and, in 1811, was 833. It is 2\u00b1 m. W. from Tarland. The Fair is holden on the first Thursday, O. S., in September. This Parisii is situate in the District of Cromar, and is about 6 miles in length, and 3i miles in breadth. The soil in the vallies is, in general, a rich deep loam, but ill cultivated, and the frosts are often intense. Game, of all kinds, are in great abundance, especially on the Hill of Morven. Here are three large Cairns, and several Druidical circles. Charles Gordon, Esq., of Blelack, is the only residing Heri tor. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with a dwelling, and a rood ofland. Near the Church, is a mineral spring, called Poldow, winch is much resorted to, for all disorders. COLDSTREAM, anciently Lennal, in the Shire of Beravick ; formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a380. in money, two chalders of meal, and one chalder of barley, together with 12 acres of very good land; the manse was built in 1782: Patron, The Earl of Hadington: The Church was built, in 1716. It is in the Presbytery of Chirnside, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 2269, and, in 1811, was 2384. It is 46 m. SE. b. E. from Edinburgh, and 334^ m. N. b. W, from London. The Fairs are holden on the 30th of July, and 12th of November. It is a General Post-Office Town. A neat bridge over the river Tweed here. Pp2"], [356, "COL unites Eno*land and Scotland. This Parish is from seven to eight miles in length, and about four miles in breadth at an average: the general appearance of thc country is flat ; the soil is mostly rich, and highly cultivated ; near the Tweed, it is lio-ht, but inclining to clay, further Westward: a broad slip of barren land runs through the Parish from East to West, called The Moor-land. The air is in general dry, and healthy: agues prevail in some seasons, but not regularly. It is pleasantly situate on the river Leet, Avhich here falls into the Tweed. The price of coals is moderate. The roads are good, and since the building ofthe bridge over the Tweed, it has become a great thoroughfare. The Salary of the School master is 300 merks, together with perquisites. Here General Monk fixed his Head-quarters, before he marched into England to restore Charles the Second, where he raised that Regiment, which, being in succession recruited, has ever since been called The Coldstream Regiment of Guards. There are several tumuli in the Parish, which are said to contain the bones of those who fell in the Border wars. According to Mr. Chalmers, the Parish of Leinhall appears in Charters, as early as the year 1147. When Gospatrick, the Earl of Dunbar, founded the Cistertian Nunnery at Coldstream (of which ancient structure, a vault only now remains), he gave it the Church of Layn-el, Avith half a carueate ofland at Layn-el, and another half carueate at Birgham. And Derder, his Countess, granted to the same Nunnery the Church of Hirsel, and a carueate of Land, which the Earl confirmed. In this manner, were the Churches of Lein hall, and Hirsel invested in the same Religious House: but, the Church of Hirsel came afterwards to be considered only as a Chapel, subordinate to the Church of Leinhall : the Church of Hirsel stood on the lands of Hirsel, which form the South-Western part of this Parish. The Church of Leinhall continued in the possession of the Prioress of Coldstream, till the Reformation ; and it pre served its ancient name, for a century and a half, after that epoch. In 1716, a new Parish Church was built, at the village of Coldstream; and the designation ofthe Parish became afterward the name of the Kirk-town. The ruins of the Church of Leinhall stand about a mile Northward from Coldstream, on the steep bank of the Tweed, which has carried away a part of the Church-yard : the vil lage of Leinhall disappeared, amidst the waste of the Border wars : but the Mansion-House of Leinhall still appears on the bank of the Tweed, above the ruins ofthe ancient Church. Hirsel, the beautiful Seat of The Earl of Home, \u2014 and Kersfield, the property of Mr. Morison, are great ornaments to the neigh bourhood. There are two Obelisks in the parish, both of which were erected by"], [357, "COL Alexander, the late Earl of Home : and one of them, exhibiting in miniature the elegant and beautiful proportions of the Obeliscus Matthei at Rome, was intended by Lord Home as a monument, in memory of his eldest Son Lord Dunglass, who died in America of the wounds which he received in the battle of Camden. A remarkable Thunder-storm happened in this Parish, on the 19th of July 1785; an accurate and scientific account whereof, by Captain Patrick Brydone, of Lennal-House, is printed in The Philosophical Transactions of London, vol. 77. p. 61. COLENHAUGH, v. STORMONT-FIELD. COLGRAIN, v. CARDROSS. COLIN'S-BURGH, in the District of St. Andrew's, aud Shire of Fife : in the Parish of Killconquhar. It is 28a m. N. N. E. from Edinburgh.

It is in the Presbytery of Perth, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (containing the Villages of Collace, and Kinrossie) was 562, and, in 1811, was 663. It is 7 m. N. E from Perth. This Parish lies in the vale of Strathmore, and comprises a square of about two miles in extent. Improvements in agriculture are carried on here, with great ardour and success. Lord Dunsinnan is the sole Proprietor of the Parish ; and who, among other judicious and beneficial arrangements, has, with a liberality truly noble and benevolent, assigned '* a house and garden to every aged and infirm person, who is incapacitated for the duties of active life, and unable to procure subsistence by labour.\" Here is a Quarry of excellent free stone. The great road, from Perth to Cupar of Angus, traverses this Parish, in an oblique direction. Dunsinnan House is the elegant and commodious Mansion of The Right Honourable Sir William Nairne, one ofthe Lords of Session. On the summit of Dunsinnan Hill, are the foundations of the celebrated Castle of Macbeth, full in view of Birnam Wood, on the opposite side of the plain. No"], [358, "C O L place, according to Mr. Pennant, could be better adapted for the seat of a jealous tyrant ; the sides are steep, and of the most difficult ascent ; the summit com manding a view to a great distance in front and rear. At present there are not any remains of this celebrated fortress : and its place is noAV a verdant area, of an oval form, fifty-four yards by thirty, and surrounded by tAvo deep ditches. The traditions in the neighbourhood concerning the predictions ofthe Witches, and the defeat and death of Macbeth, are highly in unison with Shakespeare's incomparable Drama of that Usurper ; though it is now said, that he Avas slain by Macduff at Lumphanan : \u2014 I Avill not yield To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet ; And to be baited Avith the rabble's curse Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinnane, And thou, oppos'd, be of no woman born, Yet I will try the last. \u2014 COLLESSIE, in the District of Cupar, and Shire of Fife : formerly a Vicar age, the Stipend of Avhich, in 1811, was \u00a3150., and a glebe: the manse is jn tolerable repair: Patron, Mr. Johnston, of Lathrisk, Avho is also one of the principal Proprietors : The Church is in decent repair. It is in the Presbytery of Cupar, and Synod of Fife. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (including the Village of Kinloch) AA*as 930, and, in 1811, was 981. It is 5{m. W. from Cupar of Fife. This Parish is about 8 miles in length, and 5 miles in breadth. Towards the North-West, the surface is somewhat hilly ; but the Southern part is remarkably flat, and pretty fertile. The air is in general healthy. The roads, and bridges, are in good repair. Coals are the common fuel. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School fees, a School-house, dwelling, and a small garden. Not far from the Church, are the remains of two old Castles. Nether Rankillor, the Seat of Colonel Maitland, is a good modern Mansion, embosomed in very extensive woods. COLLINGTON, anciently HAILES, in the Shire of Edinburgh : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., together with a manse, and glebe : Patron, The Earl of Lauderdale : The Church, which was built in 1773, is a neat and convenient edifice ; it is situate at the village of Collington, and hence has arisen the present name ofthe Parish. It is in the Presbytery of Edinburgh, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale, The Resident Population of"], [359, "COL this Parish, in 1801, was 1397, and, in 1811, was 1605. It is 4\\ m. S. W. from Edinburgh. This Parish contains about 5070 Scotch acres. It takes in part of the Pentland Hills, and comprises Caerketan Craig, which is 1450 feet above the level ofthe sea ; \u2014 Capelaw, 1550 feet ; \u2014 and the Logan House Hill, which, by repeated barometrical observations, has been found to be 1700 feet high. The arable lands slope gently from the skirts ofthe hills to the level ofthe river, and are all inclosed, and highly cultivated. The river of Collington, or rather The Water of Leith, abounds with much romantic scenery, and, in a course of ten miles, drives no fewer than 71 mills. There has always been a respectable Grammar School kept in the Parisii ; the Salary of which is 300 merks Scotch, with very moderate School-Avages, and some small emoluments. On the lands of Comiston, are the vestiges of a very large and ancient encampment ; near which were lately two large Cairns, that were demolished, for the purpose of making the Turn-pike road, when several fragments of old arms were discoAered ; two of which are now in the possession of Mr. Trotter, of Morton Hall, the Proprietor of the ground. Here is also a large upright stone, called Tlte Kel Stane, i. e. The Stone ofthe Battle ; it has also immemorially gone by the name of Camus Stone, which would seem to intimate its connection with some Danish Commander. COLL, ISLAND, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the District of Mull, and Shire of Argyle. It constitutes part ofthe Parish of Tir-Y, where tliere is an Assistant to the Minister, with a Salary of \u00a333.. 6.. 3. : The Chapel is in ruins. This Island is about 14 miles long, and 2 miles broad : both the ends are the property of The Duke of Argyle, but the middle belongs to Alexander Maclean, Esq., who is called Coll, as the only Laird. It is low, rugged, and bleak ; but, in some places, there are beautiful flats, which, during the summer, being culti vated, or adorned with Avild flowers, form a striking contrast with the Aveather beaten rocks Avhich skirt them. The shore, upon the East side, is generally low and rocky ; on the West, it rises into considerable cliffs, and, in many places of this side, great sand-banks extend for a considerable way. These banks are often of great height, and form groupes of sand-hills ; Avhich, according to Mr. Jameson, arc sometimes covered with the arundo arenaria, galium verum, &c. : but more frequently they present only a dreary Avaste : for, during storms of wind, the sand rises in clouds, to overwhelm and destroy the neighbouring country. The inhabitants have themselves partly to blame for the continuance of this evil, by their obstinacy in rooting up certain plants, which prevent the"], [360, "COL blowing ofthe sand ; thus, it is a common practice to use the arundo arenaria as a substitute for ropes, and the galium verum as a yellow dye : two plants which are very remarkable for their power in binding the sand. Colonel Maclean has, however, prohibited this very pernicious practice, by severe penal ties. Here are many lakes, some of Avhich have trouts, and eels, and others have never yet been stocked. Their quadrupeds are horses, cows, sheep, and goats ; rabbits are also very numerous ; and hares, Avhich were lately intro duced, are now become so. The harvest is early, and the winter is never cold, but very tempestuous. There is a stated Ferry from hence to the Isle of Mull. Bowest is the residence of Colonel Maclean, a gentleman who has lived some time in the East Indies, \" but having dethroned no Nabob, is not too rich to settle in his OAvn country.\" Grissipol, a house and farm tenanted by Mr. Macsweyn, is situate near a brook, very clear and quick, and was the scene of an action, much celebrated in the traditional history of Coll, when Macneil and many of his Clan were killed by Maclean, who then took possession of the Island. \" From Grissipol,\" says Dr. Johnson, \" Mr. Maclean conducted us to his father's seat ; who, having a very numerous family, has, for some time past, resided at Aberdeen, that he may superintend their education, and leaves the young gentleman, our friend, to govern his dominions, Avith the full power of a Highland Chief. By the absence of the Laird's family, our entertainment was made more difficult, because the House was in a great degree disfurnished ; but young Col's kindness and activity supplied all defects, and procured us more than sufficient accommodation. We were at Coll under the protection of the young Laird, without any of the distresses which Mr. Pennant, in a fit of simple credulity, seems to think almost worthy of an elegy by Ossian. Wherever we roved, Ave were pleased to see the reverence with which his subjects regarded him. He did not endeavour to dazzle them by any magnificence of dress ; his only distinction was a feather in his bonnet ; but, as soon as he appeared, they forsook their Avork and clustered about him ; he took them by the hand, and they seemed mutually delighted. He has the proper disposition of a Chieftain, and seems desirous to continue the customs of his house. The Bag-piper played regularly, Avhen dinner was served, whose person and dress made a good appear ance, and he brought no disgrace upon the family of Rankin, which has long supplied the Lairds of Coll with hereditary music. Life is here, in some respects, improved beyond the condition of some other Islands. In Sky, what is Avanted can only be bought, as the arrival of some wandering pedlar may afford"], [361, "G O L an opportunity ; but in Coll, there is a standing Shop, and in Mull, there are two. A Shop in the Islands, as in other places of little frequentation, is a Repo sitory of every thing requisite for common use. Mr. Boswell's Journal was filled, and he bought some paper in Coll. To a man that ranges the streets of London, where he is tempted to contrive wants for the pleasure of supplying them, a Shop affords no image worthy of attention ; but, in an Island, it turns the balance of existence between good and evil. To live in perpetual want of little things, is a state not indeed of torture, but of constant vexation. I have in Sky had some difficulty to find ink for a letter : and, if a Avoman breaks her needle, the work is at a stop. As it is, the Islanders are obliged to content themselves with succedaneous means for many common purposes. I have seen the chief man of a very wide district riding with a halter for a bridle, and governing his hobby with a wooden curb. The people of Coll, however, do not Avant dexterity to supply some of their necessities. Several arts which make trades, and demand apprenticeships in great cities, are here the practices of daily \u0153conomy. In ev'ery house candles are made, both moulded and dipped : their wicks are small shreds of linen cloth. They all know how to extract, from the Cuddy fish, oil for their lamps. They all tan skins, and make brogues. Of taxes here is no reason for complaining ; they are paid by a very easy compo sition. The Malt Tax for Coll is Twenty Shillings; Whisky is very plentiful ; there are several Stills in the Island, and more is made than the Inhabitants consume. The great business of Insular policy is now to keep the people in their own country. As the World has been let in upon them, they have heard of happier climates, and less arbitrary government ; and, if they are disgusted, have emissaries among them ready to offer them land and houses, as a reward for deserting their Chief and Clan. Many have departed both from the Main of Scotland, and from the Islands ; and all that go, may be considered as sub jects lost to the British crown ; for a Nation scattered in the boundless regions of America, resembles rays diverging from a focus ; all the rays remain, but the heat is gone ; their power consisted in their concentration ; when they are dispersed, they have no effect. The Inhabitants of Gott have not yet learned to be weary of their heath and rocks, but attend their agriculture and their dairies, without listening to American seducements. The disposition to pompous and expensive funerals, which has at one time or other prevailed in most parts of the civilized world, is not yet suppressed in the Islands, though some of the ancient solemnities are Avorn aw.ay, and singers are no longer hired to attend the vol. i. Q q"], [362, "COL procession. Nineteen years ago, at the burial of the Laird of Coll, Avere killed thirty cows, and about fifty sheep. Mr. Maclean informed us of an old game, of which he did not tell the original, but Avhich may perhaps be used in other places, Avhere the reason of it is not yet forgot. At Neiv- Year's Eve, in the Hall or Castle ofthe Laird, Avhere, at Festal seasons, there may be supposed a very numerous company, one man dresses himself in a cow's hide, upon which other men beat with sticks. He runs with all this noise round the house, which all the company quits in a counterfeited fright ; the door is then shut. At New- Year's Eve there is no great pleasure to be had out of doors in the Hebrides. They are sure soon to recover from their terror enough to solicit for re-admission ; Avhich, for the honour of poetry, is not to be obtained but by repeating a verse, Avith which those that are knowing and provident take care to be furnished. Very near the House of Maclean, stands the Castle of Coll, Avhich was the Mansion ofthe Laird, till the house was built. It is built upon a rock, as Mr. Boswell remarked, that it might not be mined. It is very strong, and having been not long uninhabited, is yet in repair. On the wall was, not long ago, a stone with an inscription, importing, \" That if any man of the Clan o/'Maclonich shall appear before this Castle, though he come at midnight, with a man's head in his hand, he shall there find safety and protection against all but tlte King.\" This is an old Highland treaty, made upon a very memorable occasion. Maclean, the son of John Gerves, who recovered Coll, and conquered Barra, had obtained, it is said, from James the Second, a grant of the lands of Lochiel, forfeited, I sup- pose, by some offence against the State. Forfeited Estates were not in those days quietly resigned : Maclean, therefore, went with an armed force to seize his new possessions, and, I know not for what reason, took his Avife with him. The Camerons rose in defence of their Chief, aud a battle was fought at the head of Loch Ness, near the place Avhere Fort Augustus noAV stands, in which Lochiel obtained the A'ictory, and Maclean, with his followers, was defeated and destroyed. The Lady fell into the hands ofthe Conquerors, and being found pregnant, was placed in the custody of Maclonich, one of a tribe or family branched from Cameron, with orders, if she brought a boy, to destroy him, isa girl, to spare her. Maclonich's wife, who was with child likewise, had a girl about the same time at which Lady Maclean brought a boy ; and Maclonich, Avith more generosity to his captive, than fidelity to his trust, contrived that the Children should be changed. Maclean being thus preserved from death, in time recovered his original patrimony ; and, in gratitude to his friend, made his"], [363, "COL Ca\u00bbtle a place of refuge to any of the Clan that should think himself in danger ; and, as a proof of reciprocal confidence, Maclean took upon himself and his pos terity the care of educating the heir of Maclonich. This story, like all other traditions ofthe Highlands, is variously related ; but, though some circumstances are uncertain, the principal fact is true. Maclean undoubtedly owed his pre servation to Maclonich ; for the treaty betAveen the two families has been strictly observed ; it did not sink into disuse and oblivion, but continued in its full force, while the Chieftains retained their power. \u2014 The power of protection subsists no longer; but what the law permits, is yet continued, and Maclean, of Coll, now educates the heir of Maclonich. There still remains in the Islands, though it is passing fast away, the custom of Fosterage. He who lives in Coll, and finds himself condemned to solitary meals, and incommunicable reflection, will find the usefulness of that middle order of Tacksmen, which some, who ap plaud their own wisdom, are wishing to destroy. Without intelligence, man is not social, he is only gregarious ; and little intelligence will there be, where all are constrained to daily labour, and every mind must wait upon the hand.\" \u2014 From hence the travellers were conducted by the young Laird of Coll, to Mull, Ulva, and Sir Allan Maclean's at Inch Kenneth : It is painful to add, \" we now parted from the young Laird of Coll, who had treated us with so much kindness, and concluded his favours by consigning us to Sir Allan. Here we had the last embrace of this amiable man, Avho, while these pages were pre paring to attest his virtues, perished in the passage between Ulva and Inch Kenneth.\"\u2014 The Resident Population of this Island, in 1811, was 1277.

As the Islands of Collonsay, and Oronsay, are separated by a narrow Sound, which is dry at low water, they may be considered as one Island. It contains, by survey, about 8000 acres ; of which, about 3000 are arable. The surface is unequal, having a considerable number of rugged hills, covered with heath. The soil is in general light ; along the shores it is sandy, but more fertile, and not so stony as that of Jura. Great numbers of black cattle are annually Qq2"], [364, "COL exported.

It is in the Presbytery, and Synod, of Dumfries. The Resident Population of the United Parish, in 1801, was 1106, and, in 1811, was 1298. It is 20 m. S. W. from Dumfries. This Parish is about 8 miles in length, and 4 miles in breadth, stretching along the coast ofthe Solway Firth. The surface is very irregular, particularly towards the North-East extremity, where the ground is mountainous and covered with heath, and running in a chain into the skirts of the large and conspicuous moun- tain, called Crone-Fell. The soil is, in general, light and fertile, and more adapted to pasturage than tillage. The coast along the Firth is remarkably bold and rocky, and among the crevices the marine plant samphire is found in abundance. The river Urr is two miles broad at its confluence with the Firth, and is naviga- ble from thence about 8 miles up the country by vessels of 80 tons burden : this river, about 2 miles from its entrance, forms within land a large bason, commonly called Gibb's Hold, into which large vessels are often obliged to put, in stormy weather, where they are well sheltered and moor in safety. The climate is"], [366, "COM very rainy, and is subject to sudden and violent gusts of wind from the South and South-West. Fish of A'arious kinds, but especially cod, are in great plenty. In 1793, a Salary of 200 merks Avas modified betAveen two Schoolmasters ; one of Avhom has \u00a37..2..0., together with School -fees ; and the other has the remainder, together Avith \u00a32. yearly of mortified money, and School-fees also : they each enjoy a commodious and sufficient School-house. Granite is abundant ; and furnishes great quantities of mill-stones for exportation. Fuel is scarce, and expensive. At Fairgarth, near the centre ofthe Parish, is a copious spring of excellent water, which is arched over, called St. Laurence's Well ; and near it, are the vestiges of a Chapel, with a Burying-ground around it, now occupied as a Barn-yard. In the Barony of Barclay, are the remains of a vitrified fort, called The Moat of the Mark, and of which mention is made in the Arch\u00e6ologia, vol. x. p. 148. The name ofthis Parish appears to have been anciently Culwen ; and, in the Fifteenth Century, Johannes de Culwen, the ancestor of the present family of Curwen, of Workington, in Cumberland, into which the name, when uncon nected Avith the territory, hath been corrupted, married a daughter ofthe family ofthe Stuarts, Lords of Galloway; a circumstance which is corroborated by the original contract of marriage, now in the possession of the Curwen Family. See, Southwick. COMISTON, v. COLLINGTON. COMLONGAN, CASTLE, v. RUTHWELL. COMRICH, v. APPLECROSS. COMRIE, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Prebend, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 16 bolls of meal, 8 bolls of bear, and \u00a352. .2.. 3. in money, includ ing the allowance for Communion elements : the manse, and offices, were built in 1784 : the glebe consists of 9 acres, 6 of which are pretty good land, and the other 3 are very poor: Patrons, The Crown, and The Earl of Kinnoul: The Church is old, too small, and in bad repair : There is also another Church, about 4 miles West from the Village, in which Divine Service is performed, almost wholly in Gaelic, every fourth Sunday. It is in the Presbytery of Auchterarder, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 2458, and, in 1811, was 2689. It is 6-** m. W. from Crieff. The Fairs are holden on the 21st of March, the first Tuesday in May, the 11th of July, the 8th of November, and the 4th of December. This is an increasing Village, pleasantly situate on the confluence of the rivers Earn, and Ruchil : and has a considerable trade in the spinning of yarn, and distillation of whisky. A great"], [367, "CON part of it belongs to Mr. Drummond, of Perth. Besides the Parocial School, which is well attended, there are three others, supported by the Society for propagating Christian Knowledge. Fuel is scarce, and expensive. The Gaelic is the common language. The Parish of Comrie is about 13 miles in length, and between 9 and 10 miles in breadth, comprehending Glen Airtney, Glen Lednaig, Glen Tarken, and Fina-Glen, at the head of Strathearn. The soil, in the lower grounds, is light and gravelly, and in some parts, swampy: On the sides ofthe Strath towards the East end of Loch Earn, and even along the Loch itself, is a continued ridge of lofty hills, which, from the uncertainty of the crops by intense frost and heavy rains, are mostly appropriated to the pasturage of sheep. Few districts display more variety of wild Highland scenery than Comrie. The air is very pure, and healthy ; but in the glens, there is much rain. Loch Earn is a beautiful expanse of water, 8 miles in length ; the banks of which are covered \\vith natural wood of great value ; and extensive plantations have also been made in different parts of the Parish. Ben Vorlich, the highest of the Hills, is elevated about 3200 feet above the level of the sea. Game, of various kinds, are in plenty. The roads, and bridges, are in good repair. Near the Forest of Glen Airtney, is a good slate Quarry : and, at Dalclathie, at the West end of Loch Earn, is a Quarry of excellent lime-stone, which is transported along the Lake, and has been of immense service in the improvement ofthe adjacent Parishes. Here are the remains of three Druidical temples ; and, on the plain of Dalgmcross, is a large Roman camp, of which Mr. Pennant has given a plan and description in his Tour, vol. 3. p. 96. See, Callander. CONAN, in the Shire of Ross. It is 2\u00a3 m. S. from Dingwall. Here is a fine stone Bridge, of five arches, over the river Conan, the Water-way being 265 feet. It was erected under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commissioners, and was finally inspected and approved in October 1809. CONGALTON, in the Shire of Hadington; and in the Parish of Dirlton: a Chapelry, anciently subordinate to the Vicarage of Golyn. It is 4 m. S. b. W. from North Berwick. This is the estate of the respectable family of Bethune. See, Dirlton. CONNEL, FERRY, v. KILLMORE. CONTIN, in the Shire of Ross : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 181 1, was 1000 merks Scotch, one chalder of victual, and a glebe, and manse: Patron, The Crown: The Church is in decent repair. It is in the Presbytery of Dingwall, and Synod of Ross. The Resident Population of thi* Parish, in"], [368, "COR 1801, was 1944, and, in 1811, was 1844. It is 6*- m. SW. b. W. from Dingwall. The surface is mountainous, but there is a considerable quantity of corn land iu the vallies. The air is rather moist, but not unhealthy. The Mansion-House of Coul is the Seat ofthe respectable family of Mackenzie. Several of the hills are covered Avith forests of natural wood; and game is abundant. There is a Ferry OA'er the river Rasay at Contin, and another over the Conan, three miles to the West of Contin, at a place called Little Scatwell. The Gaelic is the lan guage principally spoken here. A part of this parish is comprehended in the Shire of Cromarty. CONVETH, v. LAURENCE KIRK. CONVETH, or CONVENT, in the Shire of Inverness: formerly a Rec tory, united to the ancient Rectory of Killtarlaty. It is 5 m. S. from Beauly. This is a small, and beautiful glen, the declivities being covered with wood. In it is some excellent pasture for cattle, and the lower part is a rich deep soil ; what lies higher, is a light thin sharp soil ; and, in favourable seasons, produces very good crops of Scotch bear, and oats. It formerly belonged to the Priory of Beauly. CONYNGHAM, v. CUNINGHAME COOMB or SKIRROW, ISLAND, v. EALAN NA COOMB. COPAY, ISLE, one of Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness: it consti tutes part ofthe Parish of Harris, and is situate in the Sound. It is uninhabited. COPENSAY, ISLE, one ofthe Orkneys; and part of the Parish of Deer- Ness. This Island is about a mile long, and half a mile broad. In the Summer Months, the lofty rocks here are covered with wild fowl of various kinds, without name, and Avithout number : which, Avith their eggs and feathers, constitute the principal article of its traffic. Copensay is in the Latitude of 58\u00b0.. 55'.. 0\" North, and in the Longitude of 2\u00b0.. 26'.. 0\"_ West from Greenwich. This Island is inhab ited by two Families, whose number, in 1811, was 10 Persons. CORBET-HOUSE, v. MORBOTLE. CORDA, of Ravennas, v. LINE-KIRK. CORD ALE, v. CARDROSS. CORIA DAMNIORUM, of Ptolomey, v.

CORN-HOLM, or KIRK-HOLM, ISLE, one of the Orkneys; and part of"], [369, "COR the Parisii of Deer-Ness. This Island is about half a mile in length, and is joined to Copensay by a reef, which is dry at half-tide. Here are the ruins of a Chapel, close to which is a deep Well, built in the inside with large stones, and a flight of stairs to reach the water when low. At a little distance, are the ob scure foundations of small buildings, possibly the Cells of the Ecclesiastics. In the Southernmost point ofthe Holm, are several ruins of circular buildings; and near them, is a Quarry of grey slate, of little use in building, but curious on account of the many beautiful figures of sea-weeds which are found between the plates: these figures seem as if elegantly painted in a brass colour, and many of them are so clear as to represent the finest fibre. In the season of incubation, it is frequented by innumerable quantities of Sea-fowls. CORNY BIRN, v. NAV AR. CORPACH, in the Shire of Inverness ; and in the Parish of Kill-Malie. It is 2\\ m. N. from Fort William. This Village is situate at the junction of The Great Caledonian Canal with the Western Ocean, near the mouth of the river Lochy. An excellent road has been made from hence, under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commissioners, to Loch-na-Gaul. CORRAH, The, v. KIRK-GUNZEON. CORRICHIE, VALE, v. MID-MAR. CORRICRAVIE, v. KILL-MORY. CORRIE, in the Shire of Dumfries : an ancient Parish, noAv comprehended in the Parish of Hutton : There are now no traces ofa place of Worship at Corrie, except the Burying-ground, which is well fenced. In 1727, the sum of \u00a3280. Sterling was bequeathed to Corrie by Mr. Edward Moffat, of Exeter, a native of this Parish, as a Salary for a School-master; to whom the Heritors have granted a house, and small glebe, and the Inhabitants have been circumspect and fortunate in obtaining good teachers. The ancient Tower of Lun , situate on the brink ofthe water of Milk at Corrie Mains, was formerly' a place of great strength : it was the residence ofthe Lairds of Corrie; but it has probably been little inhabited since the family of Johnston acquired the estate of Corrie, by marriage with the daughter of Sir Thomas Corrie, upwards of 300 years ago : there are still some remains of their deer park, which almost surrounds the farms of Penlaw, and Park-Cleugh-foot.

CORSTORPHINE, or CROSTORPHIN, in the Shire of Edinburgh : formerly a Chapelry, with the ancient Rectory of Gogyr united after the Refor mation : the Stipend of which, in 1811, Avas \u00a3176.: Patron, Sir Alexander Dick, Bart. , of Prestonfield : The present Church, Avhich Avas formerly Colle giate, was founded near the ancient Parish Church of Corstorphine, in the same Church-yard, by Sir John Forester, Lord High Chamberlain of Scotland, and ancestor to the Lord Forester, in the year 1429, and dedicated to St. John the Baptist ; for a Provost, 5 Prebendaries, and 2 Singing boys : it is a respectable building of Gothic architecture, and in the form of a Jerusalem Cross. It is in the Presbytery of Edinburgh, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resi dent Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 1037, and, in 1811, was 1159. It is 4 m. W. from Edinburgh. A Penny-Post Office is established here. This Parish is about 4 miles in length, and about 2\\ miles in breadth. The surface is in general level, rising to few eminences, and these inconsiderable : over a great part of its extent, it spreads into a smooth plain : the vieAV of the Corstorphine Hills, on the South side, is remarkable for its beauty ; being decorated with the handsome Seats of Belmont, and Beechwood, and having the whole lands cultivated, and neatly inclosed : the soil is for the most part a rich loam, diver sified with clay and sand : a great part of the meadow ground is composed of decayed vegetables, and is often flooded after heavy rains. Agriculture, in its different departments, is conducted here according to the most improved modes adopted in Scotland and the bordering Counties of England. It is watered on the East by the river Leith, and on the West by the Gogyr Bum. The Hepatic Mineral Spring here, which was formerly much resorted to, has fallen into total disrepute for a number of years. The Schoolmaster has no House, but is alloAved a Sum of money in lieu of one : what is perhaps singular, he has a small piece"], [371, "COR of ground or glebe, nearly the extent of an acre, amongst the emoluments of his Office, contiguous to the village ; and besides this, he possesses an acre of ground, which lies upon the side ofthe water of Leith, near Coltbridge, which is called The Lamp Acre ; a piece of ground which Avas destined for defraying the expenses of a Lamp that hung in the East end of the Church of Corstor phine ; and, it is not long since the pulley for supporting it was taken down. They still prepare here for market, a considerable quantity of what is well known over the kingdom by the name of Corstorphine Cream. The distance from coal is the great disadvantage of this Parish. The roads are good. The village of Corstorphine lies low, and is said to have a damp and unhealthy atmosphere, but there are no evidences ofthis circumstance. CORTACHY, in the Shire of Forfar : formerly a Vicarage, with Clova united; the Stipend of which, in 1811, Avas 8 chalders of A'ictual, one half meal and the other half barley, \u00a350. Sterling, and \u00a3100. Scotch for Communion elements : The manse is in tolerable order : the glebe consists of 6 acres : Patron, The Earl of Airly: The Church is ancient, and rather incommodious. It is in the Presbytery of Forfar, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resi- dent Population of Cortachy, and Clova, in 1801, was 906, and, in 1811, was 980. It is 4. m. N. from Kirrie-Muir. The Parish of Cortachy, exclusive of Clova, is 9 miles in length, and about 5 miles in breadth in the Southern part : but in the North and Middle Districts, it does not exceed 2 miles, exclusive ofthe hills. The soil is, in general, poor, with a wet and cold bottom : in the lower part ofthe Parish, hoAvever, are several rich fields on the banks of the Prosen ; aud, on the banks of the South Esk, the largest river in the District, are haugh grounds of a light early soil. The greatest part of the Parisii is mountainous, and covered with heath. The air is sharp and piercing, and the snow remains long on the summits of the Hills ; but agriculture has been much improved here of late. Loch Oriel is about a mile and a half in circumference, and abounds with trout, and pike. Peats, turf, and heath, are the principal fuel; but these are so distant, and of such difficult access, that many of the inhabitants use coals, which are brought by land, a distance of 20 or 24 miles. The Salary of the Parochial School is 350 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a house, and garden. The Earl of Airly is Proprietor of the whole Parish, excepting one pretty extensive Farm and two Pendictas, the property of The Honourable Walter Ogilvy, of Clova, and a small Farm called Clachnobrane, the property of William Lindsay. Around the Castle of Rr2"], [372, "cou Cortachy, one of Lord Airly' s Seats, are extensive Policies, and a large and well furnished Garden, containing a Hot- house and Green-house. COTHALL, v.

It is in the Presbytery of Kin cardine O'Neil, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 679, and, in 1811, Avas 721. It is 2\\ m. S. E. from Tar land. This Parish is situate in the District of Cromar, and is about 5 miles in length and 3^ miles in breadth. The soil in the valley is deep and fertile ; but the surrounding hills are bleak and barren, affording pasturage only for sheep. The air is dry, and healthy. To the West ofthe manse, is a large marsh, called Bogmore, which in rainy seasons is completely converted into a Lake, and covered with aquatic fowls. The roads are in tolerable repair. The Castle of Coutt is completely demolished. COUNTESS- WELLS, v. PETER CULTER. COUSLAND, in the Shire of Edinburgh ; and now constituting part of the Parish of Cranston. It is a neat Village, at the distance of 3i miles East from Dalkeith. The Manor, and Chapelry of Cousland, were annexed to the Parish of Cranston, about the time ofthe Reformation. The Chapel stood on the South side ofthe Village of Cousland, where its remains may still be traced, with its almost forgotten Cemetery ; and, it was probably dedicated to St. Bartholomew, as some lands near it retain the name of Bartholomew 's Firlot. In 1547, Cous land was burned by The Duke of Somerset, when he invaded Scotland with a powerful army, to enforce the marriage of the Princess Mary with Edward Kino* of England. Sir John Dalrymple, of Cousland, Grandfather to the present Baronet, was the first person Avho introduced into Scotland the sowing"], [373, "cow of turnips, and the planting of cabbages in the open field : he also greatly im proved the breed of horses and black cattle, and was among the first Avho sowed clover and rye-grass : Mr. Cockburn, of Ormiston, and himself, both of them distinguished by zeal for their country, and a passion for Agriculture, established a Society at Ormiston, which had for its object The Improvement of Hus bandry ; in Avhich, besides actual Farmers, persons of the first Distinction in the country, were proud of being enrolled as Members. COUTHALLEY, CASTLE, v. CARNWATH. COUTY, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Bendothy. Here is a bridge over the Isla. COVE, v. KIRK-PATRICK FLEEMING. COVE, in the Shire of Kincardine; and in the Parish of Nigg. It is 5 m. S. S. E. from Aberdeen. This is a small Fishing Village, on the German Ocean. Here is a School for the accommodation of the more distant part of the Par ishioners, the master of which has a small gratuity, and a School house, and garden. COVE, The, v. COCKBURN'S-PATH. COVINGTON, in the Upper Ward, and Shire of Lanark : formerly a Rec tory, the Stipend of which, in 18-11, was \u00a3150., and a glebe : the manse has been lately rebuilt, and is in good repair : Patron, Mr. Lockhart, of Camwath : One half of the Church is part of an old Gothic building, the remainder having been added about the end of the Seventeenth Century. It is in the Presbytery of Biggar, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Village of Thankerton) Avas'456, and, in 181 1 , was 438. It is 4 m. W. N. W. from Biggar. This Parish is about 3 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth. The surface is partly mountainous, and covered with heath ; and partly haugh ground on the banks of the' Clyde, which is fertile, and well cultivated. Coals are the general fuel, brought from a distance of 9 miles. The roads are in tolerable repair. Here are four circular Camps, and two large cairns ; upon one of which, on the summit ofthe hill of Tinto, a conti nued fire was anciently kept up, from whence its name is derived, that is, The Hill of Fire. There is also a fine ruin of a fortification, built by a Knight ofthe name of Lindsey, in 1442. COWAL, a District so called, in the Shire of Argyle. This is a Peninsula, stretching North-East and South-West between the Firth of Clyde, and Loch Fyne. The North-East part of the District, which borders with Perthshire, presents a very rugged and broken surface. The Mountains become gradually"], [374, "cow lower and smoother, as you advance to the South-West ; and toAvards the extremity, comparatively speaking, the landis low and level. The hills afford excellent pasture for black cattle and sheep. It is intersected by three arms of the sea, Loch Ridan, Loch Straven, and Loch Goil ; and the fresh water Lake, Loch Eck, Avhich is 6 miles in length, and half a mile in breadth, abounding with fresh water herrings ; a dry, insipid fish, not discovered in any other Lake on the Western coast, except that of Loch Lomond. The coast is partly flat, and partly bold and rocky, possessing many creeks and harbours, that afford shelter to the busses employed in the herring-fishery. This District comprehends the Parishes of Strachur and Strath-Lachlan, Loch-Goil-Head and Killmorich, Kill- Modan, Kill-Finan, Inver-Chaolain, and Dunoon and Killmun. It is separated from the Shire of Dunbarton, on the East, by Loch- Long. The introduction of sheep into this country, Avhich took place about sixty years ago, has produced a verdure upon the mountains Avhich were formerly covered with heath : and the landed gentlemen noAv see their interest in improving the breed of sheep and of black cattle, and are turning their attention to the cultivation of green crops for their support in winter. Snow, indeed, seldom lies here any considerable time, except on the tops ofthe mountains; but the very backward springs, with which it has been visited of late years, renders it absolutely necessary to make some provision for cattle at the season when they are bringing forth their young, otherwise they are apt to desert them. There are still a few Goats in some places, but the value ofthe woods, to which these animals are very inimical, has almost banished them from the Highlands. The Duke of Argyle is Earl of Campbell and Cowal. COWCADDENS, within the Jurisdiction ofthe City of GiasgoAv, and Shire of Lanark : in the Barony Parish. This is a populous Village. COWDEN-KNOWS, or COLDEN-KNOWS, in the District of Melros, and Shire of Roxburgh : in the Parish of Melros. It is situate near the West bank of the river Lauder,, at the distance of three miles North from Melros. Here was the residence ofthe great Baronial Family of Home. Mr. Crawford, in his elegant Song of \" Cowden- Knows,\" with fond recollection, remarks, \" Not Teviot braes, so green and gay, May with this broom compare, Not Yarrow banks in flow'ry May, Nor the bush aboon Traquair.\" \" The Broom of Cowden-Knows,\" which is inserted in the usual collections, is"], [375, "C R A not the original, although it was a popular song in Allan Ramsay's time : it must, indeed, be of a much earlier date, as in an old black letter (English) Ballad of Charles or James the Second's time, it is directed to be sung \" To a pleasant Scotch tune, called \" Tlie Broom of CowdenknowsA COWEY'S LINN, v.

It is in the Presbytery of Ayr, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 848, and, in 1811, was 1159. It is 5 m. S. E. from Ayr. This Parish is about 7 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth. The surface is flat, and the soil is a deep fertile clay, particularly productive on the banks of the rivers Ayr and Kyle. The air is wholesome. Coals, lime, marl, and free-stone, are abundant. There are three considerable Lakes ; especially that of Martorham, which is a mile in length, and in some parts a quarter of a mile in breadth. Several plantations have lately been made here ; which are, as well as the natural woods, in a flourishing state. CRABBY, HARBOUR, v. ALDERNEY, ISLAND. CRAG TOWER, v. OXNAM. CRAIAG, CASTLE, v. LOTH. CRA1BSTOWN, v. DESKFORD. CRAIG, v. AUCHINDORE, and KILLMAURS.

Sterling, which includes \u00a38. .6.. 8. for Communion elements : the manse, and offices, are in the very worst state of re pair, but measures are at present in agitation for providing better accommoda tion, and if possible also a more convenient situation : the glebe consists of about 7 acres, including the garden : Patrons, The Masters ofthe New College of St. Andrew's : The Church is a very handsome edifice ; there were formerly four Burying-places here ; the principal one, at present, being in the Island of Inch"], [376, "C R A Brayock, by which name this Parish was originally called. It is in the Presby tery of Brechin, aud Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (including the Fishing Villages of Ferryden, and Usan) was 1328, and, in 1811, was 1465. It is \\ m S. b. W. from Montrose. This Parisii contains 3308 acres, Scotch measure ; the whole of \"which, a few hundred acres excepted, is arable, and nearly all inclosed : the soil is, iu general, good, and produces excellent crops : to the South and West it is considerably elevated, being about 400 feet above the level of the sea. The air is pure, aud healthy. The Coast, which is about four miles in extent, is one continued Rock, and abounds with fish : the course ofthe tide is North and South, the flood coming from the North. The Salmon Fishings on the South Esk, which divides this Parish from that of Montrose, are not so productiAre as formerly. The Roads are in good repair. There are two Bridges, one of stone over the South branch of the South Esk ; and a larger one of wood, which communicates with the Island of Inch Brayock. Personal Services have long been abolished here. The Salary of the Parochial School is \u00a320., together with School-fees, and other perquisites, amounting to about \u00a320. more, and a substantial Dwelling-house, an elegant School-house, and a small garden. At Bodden, upon the coast, there is a lime work carried on to a considerable extent. The greatest disadvantage, under which this Parish labours, is the high price of coals. The good and exemplary Robert Leighton, Archbishop of GlasgoAV in the reign of Charles the First, was of the Family of Usan ; having resigned the dangerous dignity Avhich he could not support Avith comfort to himself, or advantage to his Sovereign, he retired to Sussex, and by a sudden death, closed a life of literary labours, and of genuine piety, hi 1684. There were formerly two Castles here; one of them, called Black Jack, situate on the sea-shore, was once the residence of the family of Scot, of Dunninald, but, by the falling ofthe rock, tliere are now scarcely any remains of it: \u2014 -the other, called The Castle of Craig, though in ruins, is still inhabited. At the Eastern extremity of the Parish, where the South Esk unites with the German Ocean, there were the remains of an earthen Fort, in the form ofa square ; and Avhich, tradition reports, was made use of by Oliver Crom well ; but whether erected by him, or in more ancient times, was uncertain : at this Fort some cannon were placed, so late as the year 1745 : but it is now completely demolished, and the cannon are removed. At the Fishing Village of Usan, is a quadrangular Tower, between 20 and 30 feet high, for a land-mark, to direct vessels at sea ; aud, along the South side of the river, at a small"], [377, "C R A distance from each other, two conical Towers or Pillars were lately erected b) the Town Council of Montrose, for directing vessels when to take the river with safety.

It is in the Presbytery of Ayr, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 786, and, in 1811, was 767. It is 4 m. S. from Killmamock. This Parish contains about 5500 Scotch acres. The soil is in general light, and gravelly ; but, in some parts, it is a deep strong clay ; and the greatest proportion is arable, well inclosed, and very productive : the hills are covered with verdure, and afford excellent pasture for a great num ber of cattle. Coals, and limestone, are in abundance. The air is pure, and healthy. The emoluments of the Parochial School are about \u00a330.

The surface is low and flat ; and the soil is tolerably fertile ; but the climate, on account of its vicinity to the Atlantic Ocean, is so extremely moist and variable, as often to blast the most promising hopes of the farmer. In the channel betAveen this Parish and the Islands to the West, the tide is very rapid, and the sea gener ally very boisterous. The Gaelic is the prevailing language. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and 50s. arising from a mortification. Fuel is scarce. Here are the remains of several Danish forts : tliere are also many cairns, one of which, said to have been erected over Olaus, a Son ofthe King of Denmark, Avho was slain here, has been converted into a family burying place by General Campbell.

It is in the Presbytery of St. Andrew's, and Synod of Fife. The Resident Population ofthis Town, and Parish, in 1801, (including the Village of Fife's-Ness) was 1652, and, in 1811, was 1600. It is 39 m. N. N. E. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. This is a place of great antiquity, being mentioned by old Historians, as a ToAvn of considerable note, as early as the middle of the Ninth century. It consists of two parallel Streets, extending along the Northern shore of the Firth of Forth, which is here pretty steep. It was erected into a Royal Borough by Robert Bruce, which Charter was successively confirmed by different Monarchs, with the addition of several new Grants : and it now, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of Kill renney, Anstruther Easter, Anstruther Wester, and Pittenweem, sends one Member to Parliament. The Harbour is neither commodious, nor safe : but a little to the Eastward of the Town, there is a small Bay, called Rome, which might be made an excellent Harbour at a small expense. Its Privileges extend from the middle of the water of Leven, to the water of Puttekin, which falls into Ss2"], [380, "C R A the German Ocean at the mouth of Pitmilly Burn ; with a right to the fishings, tolls anchorage, &c, in all the Harbours and Creeks within these bounds : and, accordingly, the Customs are regularly collected between Crail and Pitmilly : On the erection of the Royal Boroughs of Pittenweem and Anstruther Easter, they Avere severally charged Avith an annual rent : but the other places between Crail and Leven do not appear ever to have been accustomed to make any such payments for their Anchorage and Customs ; though the question has never yet been decided, whether the Town of Crail has or has not lost these, Avith several other rights and privileges. This was formerly the great rendezvous for the Herring fishery ; but the fishery, from various causes, has long been on the decline, and with it also the ToAvn has gone to decay. Great quantities of lob sters are annually sent to the London market. The Magistrates and Town- Council are Patrons ofthe Public School, thc Salary of Avhich is \u00a316. perannum, and is paid by them out ofthe revenues ofthe Burgh: besides which, the Master has School-fees, and perquisites, amounting in the Avhole to upwards of \u00a340. a year. The Parish of Crail is about 6 miles in length, and of very irregular breadth, comprehending the whole of the Eastern extremity of Fife. The general appearance is flat, and naked ; and the soil varies from the richest black loam, to the poorest thin Avet clay. Free-stone, of an inferior quality, is in plenty : there is also some lime-stone, and coals were formerly Avorked here. The roads are in tolerable repair. Between the Parish of Denino and King's Muir, is a little Farm, which pays Stipend to the Minister of Crail. There are still some remains of the ancient Priory ; and of the old Castle, in which King David the First frequently resided, and from Avhich circumstance Crail became a Constab ulary, extending Westward to Kinraig Nooke. The remains of the House of Balcomie, a Seat ofthe late General Scott, are well known as a Sea-mark by sailors Avho navigate these seas. Airdrie, and Wormiston, are also two fine modern Houses ; the former belonging to Methuen Ereskine, Esq. ; and the latter .to Patrick Lindsay, Esq. CRAILING, in the District of Jedburgh, and Shire of Roxburgh : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 181 1, was 85 bolls of meal, and a little more than 75 bolls of barley, Linlithgow measure : the Minister is entitled to the Vicarage Tythes, consisting of Lambs, Wool, Lint, Hemp, Hay, &c. ; tliere is likewise a glebe of 9 acres and 17 poles English : Patrons, The Crown, and The Marquis of Lothian : The present Church, and manse, were built about 45 years ago ; the Church is small, but handsome, well finished, and in good repair ;"], [381, "C R A it stands remote from all other buildings, on an eminence near the South bank ofthe Teviot, where that river is joined by the Oxnam, which is about the centre of the Parisii : when this Church was built, the Church of Nisbet Avas thrown down, and not a v'estigeof it now remains: The Hospital and Chapel at Spital were long* ago demolished, and even the Burying-ground there has been totally abandoned for many years ; nothing but afeAV Tomb-stones now mark the place, and these are almost groAvn over with trees and weeds ; but the Burying-ground at Nisbet is still used, by all the Inhabitants on the Nisbet, and Spital side of theParish: \u2014 there are no remains of the old Church of Crailing, which stood within a few yards of C railing-House ; but the Parishioners on Crailing side, and some also who have left the Parish, still insist upon using the old Burying ground, although the Proprietor of Crailing has, in lieu of it, gwen them ar*. ample space around the neAV Church ; and although their late Minister set them an example, by erecting there a Tomb for himself some years before he died : \u2014 the manse stands upon the old site of Crailing manse, nearly about half a mile South from the present Church. It is in the Presbytery of Jedburgh, and Synod of Merse and TeA'iotdale. The Resident Population of the United Parishes of Crailing, Nisbet, and Spital, in 1801, was 669, and, in 1811, was 695. It is 4 m. N. N. E. from Jedburgh. In the reign of David the First, it appears by records, that there were then two adjoining Manors, two Villages, two Churches, and two Parishes, which Avere distinguished by the names of Crailing, and Upper Crailing: the Abbot of Jedburgh acquired those Churches from the munificence of Gospatrick, the Sheriff; and the Barony of Upper Crailing is now included in the Parish of Jedburgh : the old Parish of Crailing is inter sected, from South to North, by the river Oxnam, which here enters the Teviot: on the 23d of October 1612, an Act passed, declaring the Kirk of Crailing to be a Parish Kirk. The time of Union ofthe several Parishes is very ancient. It is -of a circular form, being nearly four miles in diameter. The soil, though various, is excellent, and very fertile; and the climate is dry and wholesome. It is believed, that there is not, in any part of the Kingdom, a better system of agriculture. There is a small Spring near the manse, within a few yards ofthe Minister's Avell, of which the Peasants speak highly, as a cure for the cholic. Tliere are two Established Schools in the Parish, viz. one at Crailing, and one at Nisbet. The Schoolmaster of Crailing has 300 merks as Salary, and about \u00a33. as being Parish and Session Clerk : he has also the Interest of money, left by bonds for his use, to the amount of \u00a33.. 15.. 0. per annum. The Schoolmaster of Nisbet has \u00a32. 15..6|. as Salary, and 10s. for collecting the Poor's Rates of"], [382, "C R A the Barony of Nisbet : The School fees are very small. The Turnpike Road on the South banks of the Teviot, between Hawick and Kelso, passes through this Parish. The other Roads are kept in repair by Statute money. There is a Bridge over the Oxnam, near the manse, which is the only one in the Parisii : it Avas built about 30 years ago, by subscription, and is still in good repair ; \u2014 the nearest Bridge over the Teviot, is that at Ancrum, a short distance above. But, for the convenience ofthe Parish, the Heritors maintain a Boat, and pay a Boatman : to this they are bound, on account of the annexation of Nisbet and Spital to the Church of Crailing ; and, on Sundays, no fare is exacted from those persons, who attend the Parish Church. Crailing- House is the Seat of Mr. Hunter. Mount Teviot Lodge is a Seat of The Marquis of Lothian. A Roman Road passed through the West part ofthis Parish, the traces of which are still to be seen. There are also vestiges of two encampments on the top of Penel heugh, which we may presume belonged to the Romans, from their vicinity to that Road : one of them seems to have been strongly fortified, and though now totally demolished, still retains the name of The Castle: the site of it is very high, and commands a most extensive prospect, taking in at once all the windings of the Teviot from Hawick to Kelso, and part of the several beautiful streams which join it in that course: the whole County of Berwick is also seen from it, and a part of the German Ocean : the view is bounded on the South by the lofty Mountains of Cheviot, and, on the North, by the Lammer-muir Hills. The greatest disadvantage under which this Parish labours, is the distance from coals. See, Nisbet, and Spital. CRAMOND, properly CAER- AMON, i. e.

This Parish is 6 miles in length, and from one to two miles in breadth, and contains in the Avhole about 3890 Scotch acres, including the two small Islands of Cramond, and Inch Mickery. The Northern boundary is formed by the Forth, which is here from four to six miles over : on the West, it is watered by the small river Amon, which empties itself into the Forth, and is navigable only for the space of a quarter of a mile above its entrance. The Vil lage of Cramond is situate on its Eastern bank. Towards the North and East the surface is flat, being interspersed with gentle eminences : this part is fertile, and the cultivation is well attended to : the Southern and Western part of the Parish is more hilly, and broken. The Fisheries on the Forth are much diminished. The principal manufacture here, is the forging of iron, and working of steel. There are many large seams of coal ; but, though pits have been frequently sunk, they have shortly been given up, on account of the badness of the coal. On the lands of March field, is a Mineral spring, called The Well of Spate, con taining sufficient quantity of sulphate of magnesia, to render it highly purgative. The Schoolmaster's salary is \u00a310..2..11., with 4\u00a7- bolls of barley, and School fees. There are also two private Schools : and a Sunday School ; for the sup port of Avhich, the interest of \u00a325. Avas granted by Sir John Inglis, in 1786.

The river Amon, is the Ahxterva of the Romans, Avhere they had a Station, and where various antiquities have been discovered. The Knights' Templars had a Juris diction over their lands, within the Shire of Edinburgh, which seems to have been acquired, by the family of Primrose: and, in June 1651, James, the \"son of David Primrose, was served heir to his father, in the Templars' lands of Cramond Regis; and also in the Hereditary office of Baillie of the Templars' lands, Avithin this ample Shire.

It is in the Presbytery of Dunse, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The elevated situation ofthis Parish, being in the middle of Lammer-Muir Hills, renders the air sharp, and cold ; it is, however, pure and healthy ; and, during the summer months, is tolerably mild and temperate. Part of the Parisii of Longfor-Macus intersects it in the middle ; so that a con siderable portion of it lies at the distance of four or five miles from the Church. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 166, and, in 1811, was 186. It is 9 m. N. W. from Dunse. The RiA'ers Whittadder, and Dye, flow through the Parish, and abound with trout. The surface consists mostly of high hills, covered with heath and bent, and are therefore better adapted for pasture than tillage: every farm, however, possesses a considerable portion of arable land, which is generally cultivated and sown with turnips, for the support of the sheep during the severity of winter ; lime has been applied with the greatest service here. The Castle of Cranshaws, noAv the property of Charles Watson, Esq. , is a strong ancient building, of small extent ; and is one of those places of de fence, to which the inhabitants of this part of the country were accustomed to retreat, upon sudden incursions of the English borderers : it has lately been repaired by its present proprietor, and is occupied by him as a dwelling-house, when he visits this part of his estate. Upon a hill, on the West side ofthe Parish are two heaps of stones of an immense size, each containing many thousand carts load : a tradition has long prevailed, that they were collected to commemorate the death of two tAviu brothers who fell in battle, when they were commanding opposite armies, and from thence the hill on which these piles are erected, ob tained the name of Twin-Law. In the Fourteenth Century, according to Mr. Chalmers, the Barony of Cranshaws appears to have been obtained by the family of Douglas. In 1401, Sir John Swinton, of Swinton, acquired the lands"], [385, "C R A of Cranshaw, from Archibald, the fourth Earl of Douglas, who calls him \" dilectus consanguineus noster.\" In 1585, the family of Swinton still enjoyed Cranshaws. And, in June 1640, an Act passed the Parliament of Scotland, confirming to the Laird of Swinton, the Baronies of Swinton, and Cranshaws, with the Teinds thereof, and the Patronage ofthe Church. CRANSTON, in the Shire of Edinburgh : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a357.. 6.. 11^. in money, 16 bolls 2 pecks 1 lippie of barley, 32 bolls 1 peck 1 lippie of oats, and 2 bolls 3 pecks of wheat: Patron, Sir John Dalrymple, Bart. : The Church is in decent repair. It is in the Presbytery of Dalkeith, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (comprising the three neat Villages of Cranston, Cousland, and Preston) was 895, and, in 1811, was 960. It is 4 m. E. S. E. from Dal- keith. This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth : the surface is unequal, but the gentle swellings ofthe hills, adorned with fine seats and extensive plantations, are extremely beautiful : the soil is in general fertile, and the whole Parish is arable : the staple commodity is corn, of which a con- siderable quantity is exported. The river Tyne flows through the Parish from South to North, and a mildew is said occasionally to infect its banks. The climate is mild and healthful ; though the ague occasionally occurs in the spring, during the prevalence of the Easterly wind, then loaded with cold vapour. Free-stone, lime-stone, and coals are in plenty ; arid the abundance of the last article has induced the Proprietors to erect works, on the ingenious plan of The Earl of Dundonald, for the extraction of pitch, tar, naphtha, and volatile salt, from pit-coal. The Mansion-House and Lands of East Caickmoor, al- though disjoined by the Parish of Crichton, nevertheless belong to this Parish, and pay Stipend to the Minister. According to Mr. Chalmers, the District of Cranston Avas, in the Twelfth century, divided into two Manors ; Upper Crans- ton, and Nether Cranston ; which were afterwards distinguished, as New Cranston, and Cranston Ridel. Early in the reign of William, Upper Cranston was pos- sessed by Elfric de Cranestun, who derived his local surname from the name of the Manor. His descendants, even down to the reign of Charles the Second, remained Proprietors of the Manor, which William, the third Lord Cranston, sold to Sir John Fletcher, the King's Advocate. The Church stood at Nether Cranston, which was the largest of the two Manors : this District was granted by Earl Henry, to Hugh Ridel, and from him, the District obtained the name of Cranston Ridel, whieh distinguished it till recent times. Hugh Ridel granted VOL. |JSli\u00abp3fl T t"], [386, "C R A to the Monks of Kelso the Church of Cranston, with its tythes, and other perti nents ; and the same Monks obtained from the Ridels, the lands of Preston. The old manse, which stood near to Preston-Hall, is said to have been a resting place for the Religious in their way to Melros : and over one of the windows was inscribed, \" Diversorium infra , Habitaculum supra.\" In the mean time, the Barony of Cranston Ridel continued with the Ridels, till the reign of David the Second, when it passed successively, by various transmissions, through the Murrays to the Macgills, avIio acquired the Church of Cranston. Sir James Macgill, in 1651, was created Viscount Oxenford, and Lord Macgill of Cousland, who dying in 1663, left the whole estates and patronage to his son Robert, who died, without male issue, in 1706. By another series of Heirs, those Estates, and Patronages, came to Lady Dalrymple Hamilton Macgill,, the spouse of Sir John Dalrymple, Bart. There was of old a Chapel at Cranston, Avhich served the Lord, and the Tenants of the Manor: in the Twelfth century, the advowson of it was granted to the Monks of Dunfermlin ; and Avhich probably remained with them, until the Reformation. Preston-Hall is the noble Mansion of Lord Adam Gordon : over the Barony of which, tliere was a Regality, which, on the abolition of Hereditary Jurisdictions, The Duchess of Gordon claimed, in 1747, and Her Grace was paid \u00a325.. 9.. 10.

Itis in the Presbytery of Kincardine O'Neil, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 971, and, in 1811, was 1020. It is 22 m. W. from Kincardine O'Neil. These United Parishes are very extensive, the inhabited part being about 30 miles in length, and from 6 to 10 miles in breadth ; but, taking in the mountains and waste dis- trict, the whole occupies an extent of 40 miles in length, and 20 miles in breadth. They are situate in that district of the County, called Marr, and in the very middle ofthe Grampian Hills. The soil is, in general, shallow and sandy ; yet, when properly cultivated, produces, in a favourable season, good crops. The greater part of the United Parishes was originally covered with wood, that belonged to the King, and was called The Forest of Marr ; which constituted part ofthe great Caledonian Forest. Game, of various kinds, are in great"], [387, "C R A abundance. The only branch of manufacture is the spinning of linen yarn. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, a dwelling, and a rood of land. The great Military road, from Blair-GoAvrie to Fort George, passes through these Parishes : besides which, the County roads have been brought into good repair, particularly by the disin terested and public-spirited exertions of the late Mr. Farquharson, of Monally. On the lands of Monaltry, and on the North Bank of the river Dee, in a narrow Pass, stands a cairn, which is known by the name of Cairn-na-Cuimhne, or The Cairn of Remembrance : according to tradition, the country being in danger, the Highland Chieftains raised their men, and marching through this Pass, caused each person to lay down a stone in this place : when they returned, the stones were numbered, by which means it Avas known how many men were brought into the field, and Avhat number was lost in action : since that period, Cairn-na-Cuimhne has become the Watch-word, and such is its influence, that the very mention of it would, in a moment, collect all the people in this part of the country. Abergeldie, the elegant Seat of R. N. Peter Gordon, Esq., is surrounded with extensive Plantations of great value. CRAWFORD, or CRAWFORD DOUGLAS, in the Upper Ward, and Shire of Lanark: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a31000. Scotch, and a glebe : the manse has lately been rebuilt, and is a com modious house : Patron, The Crown : The Church is in bad condition. It is in the Presbytery of Lanark, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Popu lation of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Village of Lead-Hills) was 1671, and, in 1811, was 1773. It is 8 m. N. E. from Lead-Hills. The Village of Crawford is of great antiquity, consisting of Freedoms granted by the Noble families of Crawford or Douglas, Superiors ofthe soil. Each freedom consists of 6 acres of croft land, with the privilege of feeding a certain number of sheep, cows, and horses, on the Hill or Common. It is governed by a Birley Court, in which each freedom has a right to vote. The turn-pike road, betwixt GlasgoAT and Carlisle, passes through the village. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and an old School-house, and Garden. This Parish is about 18 miles in length, and 15 miles in breadth. The greatest part of it consists of bleak hills and muirs; inthe vallies, the soil is light and spongy ; but, from its elevated situation, and cold climate, even the best grounds are adverse to agriculture.

This Parish is about 15 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth. It is a mountainous district, and is principally appropriated to pas turage. It is watered by the small riv*er Duneaton. On the estate of Glendorch, the property of The Earl of Hopetoun, there is a valuable Lead mine : and on the estate of Gilkerscleugh, coals, lime-stone, and free-stone, are in abundance. The roads are in good repair. On the top of Netherton Hill, are the vestiges of an extensive encampment]; and to the Eastward of it, are the ruins of a building, called Fairholm, Avhich is supposed to have been connected with it. The Castle of Crawford John is demolished ; but, on a peninsulated rock at Snar, are the remains of an old Castle, tAvo vaults of which are still inhabited. CRAWFURD-LAND, v. KILLMARNOCK. CRAWFURD'S-BURN, or CARTSDIKE, in the Shire of Renfrew; and in the Parish of Greenock. It is adjacent to the Town of Greenock, on the East.

It was erected into a Burgh of Barony by the interest of the Proprietor and Superior, John Maculloch, Esq., of Barholm. A considerable number of vessels belong to this Port, of from 20 to 60 tons burden, several of which are employed in exporting sea-shells for manure, and others in the coasting-trade : a little below the ToAvn, is a very safe Harbour for Ships of 500 tons burden. The fisheries are productive.

This Parish is about 3 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth. The soil is thin and sandy, but yields abund ant crops of barley. The climate is healthy. The roads are good. The School master, besides the legal Salary, School-fees, and perquisites, has the Interest of 2000 merks. Upon an eminence near the Church, are the vestiges of an ancient encampment. The Castle, which is in ruins, belonged to Cardinal Beaton. CRICHTON, or CREIGHTON, in the Shire of Edinburgh : formerly a Collegiate Church, and Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 3 chalders 12 bolls of barley, 3 chalders 4 bolls of meal, and \u00a345. Sterling in money; the glebe is between 6 and 7 acres of good land ; the manse was built, in 1758, and is in tolerable repair : Patron, Colonel Callander : The Church, Avhich is a venerable building in the form of a Cross, the Western end having been left unfinished, was made Collegiate, on the 26th of December 1449, by Sir AVilliam Crichton, Chancellor of Scotland, with consent of James Crichton, of Fren draught, Knight, his son and heir, for a Provost, 8 Prebendaries, and 2 Singing boys, out of the rents of Crichton and Locherworth, and a Mensal church, belonging to the Archbishop of St. Andrew's ; reserving to the Bishop, the Patronage of the Prebends of Vogrie, Arniston, Middleton, and Lochenvorth. After the Reformation, the Church lands of Crichton, and the Parsonage tythes, which belonged of old to the Rectory of Crichton, were acquired by Sir Gideon Murray, the last Provost ofthe Collegiate Church, who obtained a Grant, con verting those Collegiate lands into Temporal estates.

It is in the Presbytery of Dalkeith, and Synod of Lothian and TAveeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (containing the Villages of Crichton, and Path-Head) Avas 923, and, in 1811, was 1082. It is 5k_ m. SE. b. S. from Dalkeith. This Parish contains about 3900 acres; of Avhich, above 1100 acres are Out-field, and are little capable of improA*ement, the surface being over grown with moss, on a wet soft sand, or clay bottom : but the Proprietors have lately turned their attention to planting, and the trees seem to thrive well on this heretofore barren spot : the other part of the Parish is Avell adapted for tillage, with a rich deep soil, capable of producing luxuriant crops, and much of it is inclosed. A Lime-stome Quarry is Avorked to a considerable extent. Coal has been discovered, but hitherto no pits have been opened. The roads are good. This Parish has a peculiar advantage in being altogether freed from thirlage. The School has been, for some years past, removed to Path-Head, the most populous part ofthe Parish : the Master's salary is 300 merks, which, with School-fees and perquisites, make the whole amount to upwards of \u00a330. per annum. At Longfaugh are the remains ofa Camp, ofa circular form : and it is probable, that a battle had been fought in this Parish, from the great number of bones Avhich were dug up when Path-Head was built. The Castle, which, according to Mr. Pennant, is seated on the edge of a bank above a grassy glen, was once the habitation ofthe Chancellor Crichton, joint guardian Avith The Earl of Callander of James the Second; a powerful and spirited Statesman in that turbulent age, and the adviser of the bold but bloody deeds against the too-potent Douglas ; facts, excusable only by the plea of necessity of state. During the life of Crichton, it was besieged, taken, and levelled to the ground by William Earl of Douglas, after a siege of nine months. It was re-built ; and some part, which appears more modern than the rest, with much elegance. The front of one side ofthe Court is very handsome, ornamented with diamond-shaped facets, and the soffits ofthe Stair-case beautifully carved : the cases of some ofthe windows are adorned with rosettes, and twisted cordage. It is at present the property of Sir John Callander, Bart. Mr. Pennant, and Mr. Grose, have both preserved views of it.

Sterling in money, and \u00a31..13..4. Sterling for grass : the manse Avas built in 1780 : Patrons, The Crown, and The Countess of Sutherland : The Church is in good repair. It is in the Presbytery of Dornoch, and Synod of Sutherland and Caithness. The Resident Population ofthis Parish,in 1801, was 1974, and, in 1811, was 1969. It is 11- m. W N.W. from Tain. This Parisii is upwards of 40 miles in length, the inhabited part being 24 miles long ; the breadth is unequal, A'arying from 2 to 10 miles. It lies on the North side ofthe Firth or Kyle of Tain, and the river Ockel. About one thirtieth part of this extensive District is cultivated ; the rest being hilly, and covered with heath, with many interjacent spots of ver- dure, especially near the small rivulets. The soil is light and thin, except in the East end of it, where there is a deep loam ; the arable land lies mostly on the Kyle side, on hard gravel. The climate is various, in different parts ofthe Par- ish, but is not unhealthy. The two rivers Shin, and Cassly, run through the . Parish, which is also watered on the South by the Ockel: they all contain sal- mon, and sturgeons are often seen in the Shin. There are also several Lakes ; the largest of which are Loch Migdol, and Loch Elst, each about two measured miles long, and abounding with trout. A ridge of hills runs parallel to the Firth, the highest of which, in the Western extremity, is called Bein More As- sint; it is partly in this and partly in the Parish of Assint; in some places it is very rocky, but affords excellent pasture for sheep. Here is a great quantity of natural wood, chiefly oak and birch ; and there are also considerable plantations of firs, especially at Rosehall, which are in a very flourishing condition. Peat- moss, of excellent quality, is abundant. In the heights ofthe Parishes of Criech and Kincardine, is a Missionary, now supported by the* pious munificence and benevolence of Lady Ross Baillie. Near the Church, is an Obelisk 8 feet long and 4 feet broad, which, according to tradition, was erected in memory ofa Danish Chief, who was interred there. On the summit of the Dun of Criech, are the remains of a vitrified Fortress. The spinning of Linen yarn was the only species of manufacture in this District, until that distinguished British Pa- triot, and real Friend to the happiness and interest of Society, George Demp- ster, Esq., of Dunnichen) undertook the improvement of the extensive estates of Skiboi and Pulrossie.

Nor the ultimate benefit derived to your Country, by adding to it, Industrious Inhabitants and cultivated Land ; thriving Toavns and flou rishing Manufactures? Is there no pleasure in beholding the growth of woods of one's own planting? nor in the success of a System, so intimately connected with the Happiness of People placed by Providence under our Care? Some have thought, that it would be a fitter use for the Highlands, to convert them into Sheep-walks, \u2014 but that the estates Avould ultimately become more valuable, is by no means so clear a proposition.\" \u2014 At Inver Shin, near the confluence of the Shin with the Ockel, is a fine cataract. An excellent Iron bridge of one arch, spanning 150 feet, has lately been erected at Bonar, under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commissioners : who have also made a capital line of road from the Ferry here over the Dornoch Firtb, passing by Skibo to Golspie, a distance of upwards of sixteen miles : together Avith another road from hence, through the middle ofthe County of Sutherland, to Tongue on the North coast, a distance of 50\u00a3 miles. The Criech Ferry is about 150 yards wide at low water, and twice as much at high water ; and the communication is nearly as safe and easy as by a bridge, as that kind of apparatus is adopted which is in use upon the river Clyde at Renfrew ; where the Ferry boat is furnished with falling ends for the admission of horses and carriages, and a chain fixed to each bank is passed along the side ofthe boat on pullies, whereby the Boat is easily moved across the river. CRIEFF, in the Shire of Perth: formerly a Vicarage, belonging to the Chapter of Dunkeld ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : the manse, and offices, are in decent repair : the glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Patron, The Crown : The Church was re-built in 1787. It is in the Presbytery of Auchterarder, and Synod of Perth and Sterling. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 2876, and, in 1811, was 3300. It is 18 m. W. from Perth, and 56 m. N.W. from Edinburgh. The Market is on Thursday, and is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the second Tuesday in January, the third Tuesday in June, O. S., and on the 10th of October. A General Post- Office is established here. It is pleasantly situate on the Northern bank of the river Earn, over which there is a good stone Bridge ; and on the line of the great"], [393, "C R I Military road, and is much frequented by travellers, and drovers. The principal manufacture is that of linen, for the Stamping of which there is an Office here. On a plain, half a mile South from the Toavh, is a circle of twelve yards diameter, on which the Steward ofthe King's Estate of Strathearn formerly held his Court, after that Earldom fell to the Crown by the forfeiture of The Countess of Joanha ; who, having married the English Earl of Warren, was found guilty of treason able practices against Robert the First, and the Office of Steward in time be came Hereditary in the family of Drummond, 'till the abolition of Heritable Juris dictions in 1748 : for the accommodation of that Court, and other Public business, a Tolbooth was erected in 1665, by Lord John Drummond, uncle of James the third Duke of Perth ; and to that Family the Superiority of the greatest part of the ToAvn still belongs. Here is a large and elegant Assembly- Room ; and ad joining to it, is a commodious Inn, where Post-Chaises are kept. Fuel is scarce, aud expensive. The climate is particularly serene, and healthy. The Parish of Crieff is naturally divided into The Highland and Lowland Districts, which are detached from each other by the intervention ofthe Parish of Monzie : The most considerable District of the former, is the long Strath of Glen Almond, the pro perty of The Duke of Athol, through which the Almond runs a course of 8 miles ; it abounds Avith game; and is annexed, quoad sacra, to the Parish of Monzie: \u2014 The Lowland District is about 4 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth, and is surrounded by rivers that abound with salmon, and trout. The soil is mostly light and gravelly, and well cultivated, and the greatest part is inclosed. There are Quarries of excellent free-stone. CRIFFEL, MOUNTAIN, v. KIRKBEAN. CRIMOND, in the District of Deer, and Shire of Aberdeen : formerly a Vicarage, belonging to the Chapter of Aberdeen ; the Stipend of which, in 181 1, was one chalder of bear, one chalder of meal, 700 merks Scotch in'money, and \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements: the manse was built in 1763: the glebe consists of 5 acres of very good land : Patron, The Earl of Errol : The Church vyas built in 1576. It is in the Presbytery of Deer, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 862, and, in 1811, was 806.' It is 11 m. N. W. from Peterhead. The Fair is holden on the fourth Tues day, OS-, in August. This Parish contains about 4600 ; of which, nearly 3000 are arable. Along the shore, the soil is partly a light sand, and partly a light loam, easily cuHivated, and very productive, and early; but the greater part i* on a clay bottom, with a cold damp mossy soil, and very late. As the surface in vol, i. U u"], [394, "CRO flat, there are few springs of soft water ; and, in dry summers, there is often a scarcity of it. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together Avith School-fees, and perquisites, a dwelling, and a rood ofland. The public roads are in good repair. The Loch of Strathbeg , Avhich is partly in this Parish, and partly in that of Lonmay, contains about 550 acres : it is hoav separated from the sea by a ridge of sandy hills about half a mile broad ; but it formerly communi cated with the German Ocean, and vessels of small burden could enter it, until the year 1720, Avhen a strong East Avind blew the sand into the channel, and stopped all future access. At the Eastern end ofthe Lake, is a small Hill, called Castle Hill, where Cumyn Earl of Buchan had formerly a Castle. About a quarter ofa mile South from this hill, stood the ancient Burgh ofRattray, which, in the Sixteenth century, possessed all the privileges of a Royal Borough, except that of sending Members to Parliament : there is now only one feu remaining of this ancient Burgh, and the ruins ofthe Chapel, around which it was built: but the Burgage lands are of considerable extent, and of which The Earl of Errol is Superior. Rattray-Head, a very low and dangerous Promontory, stretches far into the German Ocean : it lies about 7 miles East from Kinnaird's Head, upon Avhich a Light-house has lately been erected, and which will doubtless render shipwrecks less frequent there : the coast abounds with fish, particularly cod, Avhich are of an excellent kind (Rattray cod being very famous), but for Avant of a proper landing place, they are not caught in Aery great quantities here.

Sterling in money"], [395, "CRO together with a glebe, and a good substantial manse : Patron, The CroAvn : The Church is in good condition: until the erection of a Chapel, in 1783, there was no Gaelic preached here ; and the principal reason of introducing it was, for the accommodation of Mr. Ross's numerous labourers, and others who came from the neighbouring Parishes to the manufacture of hemp : accordingly, the present place of worship was built solely at the expense of Mr. George Ross : and he obtained a grant from the Exchequer of \u00a350. to be paid annually from the Bishop's rents, as a Stipend to the Gaelic Minister : and the Crown is Patron of it. It is in the Presbytery of Chanonry, and Synod of Ross. The Resident Population ofthis Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 2208, and, in 1811, was 2413. It is 175 m. N. b. W. from Edinburgh. The Market is badly supplied. A General Post-Office is established here. The Town is built on a point ofland, Avhich stretches out on a level with the sea, and is much exposed to the wind from the East. It was formerly a Royal Borough, but was disfranchised by an Act of the Privy Council of Scotland, in consequence of a Petition for that pur pose presented by Sir John Urquhart, Proprietor of the estate of Cromarty : and it is now under the Baronial Jurisdiction of The Earl of Cromarty. This Parish is about 7 miles in length, and from one to four miles in breadth, being bounded by the Firth of Cromarty on the North. Along the North side of the Parish, and immediately above the Town, is a beautiful verdant bank, extending from the Eastern to the Western extremity, and on this is the principal part of the arable land : but the soil is in general Avet and muirish, Avhich renders the seasons late, and the crops uncertain. The climate is cold, but not unhealthy. The coast, upon the South and South -East, is bold and rocky ; but, on the North, the shore is flat, and after passing Tlte Sutor Bay about half a mile, tliere is scarcely a rock to be met with on either side of the Bay. A very strong tide flows in and out between The Sutors ; and it is remarked, that the sea has made considerable encroachments on the East end of the Town, and falls in on the West-* for, what was formerly called the Western extremity ofthe Town, is now the Eastern; neither are there any houses to the East of the old Cross of Cromarty, which is generally supposed to have been placed about the centre of the old Town. A storm from the East covers the shore here Avith great quanti ties of sea-ware, which proves excellent manure ; and about 10 tons of kelp are annually made. The Harbour of Cromarty is inferior, perhaps, to none in Bri tain for safety ; and has a commodious Quay, which was erected in 1785, partly at the expense of Government, and partly of that of Mr. George Ross, late Uu2"], [396, "CRO Proprietor of the estate of Cromarty, where vessels of 350 tons may lie in per fect security, and Avhich furnishes a smooth landing-place for the Ferry-boat, in the most boisterous weather. A very extensive manufacture of hemp is carried on here. The House, and Hill of Cromarty, the fine grounds and handsome Seat of The Earl of Cromarty, are much and deservedly admired. The old Castle Avas pulled down, in 1772. A Custom-house boat is stationed here. A large rocky Cavern, called \" Mac Farqnhar's Bed;\" and a Cave, Avhich con tains a petrifying Well, called The Dripping Well, are great natural Curiosi ties. The small District of Cromarty, according to Mr. Nimmo, appears to have been erected into a Shire at a very early period : the office of Sheriff was hered itary in the family of Urquhart, of Cromarty, in whose hands it was left at the conquest of Scotland by Edward the Third. The Old Shire comprehended, First, the whole Parish of Cromarty ; \u2014 Secondly, The Parish of Kirk-Michael, with the exception ofthe Farms of Easter Balblair, and, perhaps, Kirk-Michael, which form a tract of nearly one mile in length and half a mile in breadth, situate on the point ofland at InA'er Gordon Ferry, and which is considered as a part of the Shire of Ross ; \u2014 And, Thirdly, the Farm of Easter St. Mar tin's, in the Parish of Cullicudden. Thus, the Old Shire was a tract whose greatest length Avas 10 miles, and Avhose average breadth was a mile and three quarters. The area, therefore, is only 17 \\ square miles, being by far the small est county in Scotland. On the South ofthis District, and in the middle ofthe Peninsula, there is an extensive common Muir, named The Mullbuy, in Avhich the County of Cromarty has an undoubted share, but, until a division be made, it is impossible to ascertain any boundary in it. The boundary of The Old Shire of Cromarty begins on the shore of the Moray Firth at the burn of Eathie or Craighouse, about 3 miles South from Cromarty, follows this burn to its source and Westward in the same direction by a Park Dyke to the Fortrose road to Inver Gordon Ferry, North-North-West by this road, so as to include the White Bog, or Glen Urquhart, till we arrive at the turn towards Cromarty, and the burn of Killean or the Black Stank, where we meet the Mullbuy Moor, in which the Boundary is uncertain. On the North of this Moor, we may pro ceed from the junction of the Fort George and Kessock roads to Inver Gordon, directly West between Brea and Easter St. Martin's, to the Bridge across the burn of NeAvhall, between East and West St. Martin's, then Northwards be tAveen the Farms of Cullicudden Rectory and Resolis Chapelry, until we arrive at the Firth of Cromarty, about a mile and a half West of the Ferry of Alness."], [397, "CRO We must again cut off that piece of the Ferry point of Inver Gordon ealied Easter Balblair, as being in the Shire of Ross : it is nearly triangular, ex tending on the North-West shore about half a mile, and on the East about one mile from the point How this little patch came to be excluded from the Shire of Cromarty, does not appear. It is alluded to in the old Valuation Roll ofthe County, taken in 1688, in these words : \u2014 \" Sir Alexander Gordon in vice of St. Martin's, for all the lands he bought of St. Martin's, except Wester St. Martin's, Kirk-Michael, and Easter Balblair, which is in Ross, \u00a3894.\" \u2014 From this it would seem, that we should also include the Farm of Kirk-Michael in Ross (although it is now reckoned as part of Cromarty) ; Wester St. Martin's, and Easter Balblair, being confessedly in Ross, and, ac cordingly, are so valued in the Cess-books. \u2014 With respect to the Annexations to Ciomarty it appears, that George Viscount Tarbat, and afterwards Earl of Cromarty, who was Secretary of State and Clerk to the Parliament of Scotland, in the reign of James the Second, William and Mary, &c, procured an Act in 1685, annexing several lands to the Shire of Cromarty : this Act being after wards repealed, another was procured in 1698 ; of which the following is an ex tract (procured by Mr. Hope from the Register) from \" Act in favors of the Viscount Tarbat,\" annexing some part of his lands to the Shire of Cromarty: \u2014 \" Considering that, by Act of Parliament 1685, the Barony of Tarbat, and \" several other lands in Ross-Shire, were dissolved from it, and annexed to the \" Shire of Cromarty ; but, in 1686, this said Act of Annexation was rescinded, \" on pretence that it included lands not belonging to the Viscount Tarbat, in \" whose favour the said Annexation to Cromarty was made ; and now the said \" Viscount desiring that only the said Barony of Tarbat, and other lands in ** Ross-Shire, which belongs to him in property, and are presently possessed by \" hiih or by his brother, or mother-in-law, in life-rent, and by some wadsetters of \" his property, should be annexed to the Shire of Cromarty.

But these Annexations consist of so many detached parts, that a description of their Boundaries Avould be exceedingly irksome ; neither is it certain whether, in every instance, the information procured be sufficiently correct to give the exact Outline of every distinct part. It has been found necessary, in all Bills relating to Roads, Bridges, &c, to include the whole of these Annexations in the Shire of Ross ; although, from their being thus kept in the back ground, very great in convenience has been often felt both by the Counties of Ross, and Cromarty. In an enumeration of them it appears that, I. The Annexations in The Black Isle are : In the Parish of Cullicudden ; 1.

Fannich and Nied, a Sheep farm, on the North shore of Loch Fannich. Such are the singular Annexations to the County of Cromarty. It may be ob served, before we take leave ofthis County, that the whole of these annexed parts come under the Jurisdiction ofthe Sheriff of Ross, he being Sheriff of Ross and Cromarty, These Offices are united by the Jurisdiction Act of 1748. In the event of their separation, it is not easy to say hoAV the limits of each might be defined ; but it is presumed, that the Districts of Cullicudden and Rosemarkie would at least be considered integral parts of Cromarty ; though indeed a divi sion ofthis kind would necessarily give rise to much confusion. In the Bills for raising the Militia, &c, the Districts of Rosemarkie, Fearn, Tain, Kincardine, and Loch Broom, fall to the Shire of Ross, while not only the Districts of Culli cudden, Tarbat, and Fodderty, but the Avhole ofthe Parishes in which they are situate, are included in Cromarty. The District of Easter Logie and Easter Killmuir is curious in this respect; the Estate of New Tarbat, although of"], [400, "CRO considerable extent, being chiefly in Logie, falls to the Shire of Ross, while the small spot of Priesthill, as it includes the Church, brings the whole Parish of Killmuir into Cromarty. It being ordained in these Acts, that every Parish shall be considered as belonging to that County in which the Parish Church is situate. CROMARTY, SHIRE. This small County is a kind of Peninsula, washed on three sides by the Firths of Cromarty and Moray, and bounded on the South- West and South by the County of Ross. It was erected into a distinct County about the end of the Seventeenth Century, at the request of The Earl of Cro marty, to whom it almost entirely belonged. A great part of it is now the pro perty of the Andersons, of Udal, and the Family of Ross, of Cromarty. Its Resident Population, in 1801, was 4286, and, in 1811, was 5481. Cromarty formerly gave the title of Earl to the family of Mackenzie, which was forfeited in 1745. See, Cromarty. CROMBIE, in the District of Dunfermlin, and Shire of Fife : an ancient Parish, noAv comprehended in the Parish of Torrybum. It is Q\\ m. W. N. W. from North Queen's-Ferry.

It is in the Presbytery of Aber-Nethy, and Synod of Moray. The Resident Population of the United Parishes, in 1801, was 2187, and, in 1811, Avas 2010. It is 2 m. E. N. E. from GrantoAvn. This Parish is 20 miles in length, and, in some places, between eleven and twelve miles in breadth. The soil is in general dry and thin, with the exception ofthe flat grounds adjacent to the river Spey, which, in point of fertility, are equal to any in the neighbourhood. The hills and level grounds are covered with heath, which, though formerly thought barren and unproductive, are noAV rendered one ofthe greatest sources of National wealth, by the flocks of sheep which every where cover the face of the country. The plantations of fir, which are very extensive aud thriving, Avill soon be a great shelter and ornament to this district The climate is healthy. The river Spey is the only one, that Aoavs through the Parish, and by which vast floats of timber are carried down to the sea. White hares are frequently met with here, during"], [401, "CRO Avinter : roes, black cocks, and heath hens, are also very numerous. Lime is abundant. The common people speak the Gaelic, but the English is the pre vailing language ; though, at present, both languages are used in the Church. The Parochial School is kept at Cromdale ; the Salary being 300 merks, which is paid by the Heritors, besides School-fees, and perquisites. Stone Bridges are erected over almost every rivulet, either by the Proprietor or the County. Fuel is every where to be had, on easy terms, and of the best quality. The massy walls of the old Castle of Loch-an-Dorb, twenty feet high, surround an acre of land within the Loch of that name, and have watch towers at every corner, all entire : the entrance to it, is by a gate built of free-stone, of peculiar grandeur : several vestiges of houses, together with those of a Church, may still be traced within the walls : and from the appearance of great planks of oak, by the beating ofthe water against the foundations, an opinion is entertained, that the Island upon which it is built, is artificial : tradition says, that the particular account of its erection was lost in the troubles of King Edward the First. The Earl of Seafield is sole Proprietor of these Parishes. The low grounds on the banks of the Spey have been rendered famous by a Song, composed in consequence of a Battle fought there in the year 1690, between the adherents of King William the Third under the command of Colonel Livingston, and the supporters of the House of Stuart, headed by Clavers, commonly called Viscount Dundee, in which the latter were completely defeated. Castle Grant is the elegant Seat of the Ancient and Noble Family of Grant, Earl of Seafield. CROMWELL PARK, v. REDGORTON.

Avhich are in general rocky : the remainder presents a surface very beautifully diversified; and along the Dee, is an extensive and fertile valley, which is frequently inundated. The climate is healthy. There are two Lakes, called Erngrogo Loch, and Loch Rohn, both of A\\*hich abound Avith pike, and perch ; and the former is remark able for two small Islands Avithin it. Avhich are resorted to by numberless sea gulls during the season of incubation. At the mouth ofthe river lTrr there is a small harbour, at AA'hich English lime and coals are imported, and grain and meal are exported. The breadth of the Dee. opposite to this Parish, is from 700 to 2220 feet ; there are several fords Avhen the Avater is Ioav, but all of them are dangerous, and have often proved fatal. There are tAvo Ferries here ; one of them called, The Boat of Balmaghie ; and about a mile above it, is The Boat of Livingston. In the year 1735, William Gordon, Esq., merchant in Bristol, built a School and School-master's house (Avhich were re-built in a more central situation in 1787), and endoAved them Avith a Salary of \u00a310. per annum, on condition that all the children ofthe Parish should be taught gratis: in addi tion to this Sum, a legal salary of 300 merks Scotch has since been obtained ; and the amount, including gratuities at Candlemas, is about \u00a330., on an average. Game is plentiful. About a mile of the great Military Road, from the English border to Port-Patrick, passes through the South end of the Parish ; and the other roads are in tolerable repair.

This Parish stretches 12 miles in length on the West side ofthe river Nairn, and 4 miles on the East side, and is generally two miles in breadth : that part of the Parish which is included in the district, called Strath-Nairn, is well cultivated ; or, where the banks ofthe river do not admit of cultivation, are covered with wood, natural and planted : the other part ofthe Parish, lying to the North and North-West of the Nairn, is almost one continued Upland from one end of the Parish to the other ; and, as it consists almost entirely of waste moor ground, with small spots of land indifferently cultivated, the appearance is bleak and inhospitable : On this moor, and near the middle of it, on the East side towards the Nairn, was fought the Battle of Culloden, on the 16th of April 1746, memorable for the complete defeat ofthe Adherents of the House of Stuart, by His Royal Highness The Duke of Cumberland, and which happily put an end to their wild attempts to replace that deluded Family on the British Throne. This Parish is the property of ten Heritors, only four of Avhom are resident. Killravock is the Seat of Rose, of Killravock, one ofthe most ancient and respectable Families of this country; here is an old Tower, said to have been built in 1460, by a Patent from the Earl of Ross, with a modern House attached to it, situate upon a rock, hanging over and washed by the Nairn. A little above this, lies Holme, the seat of Mr. Rose, of Holme ; it is a neat Mansion-House, beautifully situate on the banks of the river, with some natural Avood and planting near it ; and is a part ofthe Barony of Strath-Nairn. And above Holme, is Cantray, the Seat of David Davidson, Esq., who has built a neat, commodious House there, with suitable Offices; and who has been remarkably active and successful in improving his estate : this patriotic and worthy Gentleman has also built, at his own expense, an excellent Bridge over the Nairn, a little below his House, and which is a public benefit. The Salary ofthe Established Schoolmaster is a chalder of grain, allocated on, and paid by the Tenants, in proportion to the extent of their farms; this, with the School -fees, and perquisites, make the amount about \u00a322. per annum.

Here is a Lake, called The Loch ofthe Clans ; but for what reason it goes by this name, is not known ; it is about a mile long, but the breadth is inconsiderable, and it contains no other Fish than pike. The Barony of Clova, which is situate on both sides ofthe river Nairn, is the property of Rose, of Clava ; but this Barony is accounted part ofthe Shire of Nairn, and it comprehends the farms of Cantra Down, Croy Gorstan, Dalroy, and Clava, on the South side of the water of Nairn ; and Dalgramich (about half a mile square), Cantra Bruich, Little Cantray, and East and West Urquhil, on the North side. The two Farms of Cantra Bruich, and Little Cantray, are in Nairn, but the boundary towards Culloden Moor is not very distinct.

This Parish is about 9 miles in length, and 8 miles in breadth, stretching along the German Ocean. A large portion ofthe soil is a deep rich clay, the rest is light and gravelly : but, except the mosses and a feAV banks, all of it could easily be made arable : it is watered by the river Cruden. The climate is often foggy, but not unhealthy. The Parish consists of 80 ploughs of land, of which 70 belong to The Earl of Errol. Here are three manufactories of thread, Avhich are carried on to a considerable extent. The stupendous rocks and pre cipices, along the coast, are much admired for the awful grandeur which they"], [406, "C U L exhibit : there are also several A*ery extensive caverns : and Dunbuy, a small insulated rock near The Butters', which is frequented by innumerable flocks of aquatic birds during the season of incubation, presents one of the most magnifi cent arches upon the coast. Upon a plain, in the bottom ofthe Bay of Arden draught, near Avhich the Danes then had a Castle, was fought the famous battle, in the beginning of the Eleventh century, between Malcolm the Second, and Canute, in which the Danes were totally defeated : the ruins ofthe Castle are still apparent, and a considerable part of The Earl of Errol's estate is called, The Barony of Ardendraught, a name Avhich is said to signify The old Danish roads. Bowness, or Slains Castle, is the noble Seat of The Earl of Errol, Heritable Lord High Constable, and Knight Marischal of Scotland. \" We came in the afternoon to Slanes Castle,\" says Dr. Johnson, \" built upon the margin ofthe sea, so that the walls of one of the Towers seem only a continuation of a perpendicular rock, the foot of Avhich is beaten by the waves. To walk round the House seemed impracticable. From the windoAvs the eye wanders over the sea that separates Scotland from Norway ; and Avhen the Avinds beat with violence, must enjoy all the terrifick grandeur ofthe tempestuous ocean. I would not, for my amusement, wish for a storm ; but, as storms, whether Avished or not, will sometimes happen, I may say, without violation of humanity, that I should willingly look out upon them from Slanes Castle.\" \u2014 Bowness is situate in the Latitude of 58\u00b0.52'.

It was formerly a Constabulary, of Avhich The Earl of Findlater was Hereditary Constable. It is one of the Contributary Royal Boroughs Avith Elgin, in sending one Member to Parliament. The Set, as it is called, ofthe Council, consists of 19 ; in which number are included The Earl of Seafield, Hereditary Presses, 3 Baillies, a Treasurer, a Dean of Guild, and 13 Counsellors. It is Avell supplied with fish from the Villages of Portnockie, and the Fishtown of Cullen. The Manufacture of Linen, Damask, and Stock- ings, is carried on here with advantage. The Salary of the Parochial School, which is ably conducted, is 300 merks, together with a pretty good School-house, and a convenient room for the accommodation of the Master, besides School- fees, and a rood ofland: from this School, a Bursar is sent to the Marischal College, of Aberdeen. There is also a School-mistress, Avho has a Salary of \u00a35. for teaching girls to read, and sew. And there are generally other two Schools, where young children are taught to read English, and are instructed in the principles of Christianity. The great disadvantage under which this Town labours, is the scanty supply of good water. The ruins of a House are still shown, in which Elizabeth, second Queen of King Robert Bruce, is said to have died.\u2014 The Parish of Cullen stretches from the Sea to the Southward, about two miles in length, and about one mile in breadth : to which has been annexed a part ofthe Parish of Rathven, quoad sacra, and which extends about 3 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth, comprising the Fishing Village of Portnockie, and the lands around the Chapel at Farskane. The greatest part ofthe soil con sists of a rich loam, on a soft clay bottom ; in some places, ofa strong, rich clay; and in a few, of a light loam, on a tilly bottom. The air is pure, and healthy. The Earl of Seafield is Proprietor ofthe whole Parish, except some property belonging to the Town Council ; one small Heritage, consisting ofa Hou&e, a"], [408, "C U L garden, and an acre of land, and some few acres mortified for pious uses. Cullen House, the chief residence of The Earl of Seafield, is situate on a rock, about 50 feet perpendicular above the Burn of Cullen ; over which there is an excellent stone Bridge of one arch, 84 feet wide, and 64 feet high, affording an easy communication with the Park and Woods, where the ground admits of end less beauty and variety. Near this Town, The Duke of Cumberland, after his march from Banff, joined the rest of his forces from Strath-Bogie, and encamped at Cullen. Not far from Cullen House, upon the coast, are the ruins of the Castle of Findlater ; which gave the title of Earl, now extinct, or disputed.

This is the Seat of the ancient and truly respectable Family of Forbes ; and where the Pretender lodged, the night before the memorable battle, on the 16th of April 1746. By a curious coincidence, the important and decisive battle of Culloden was fought on the moor ofthe paternal estate of that great and good man, the late Lord President Forbes, whose influence in the Highlands, and unwearied perseverance during the tAvo preceding years, made the suppression ofa very alarming insurrection comparatively easy to Government. And the services which, on this critical occa sion, His Lordship rendered to his Country, will be recorded by the faithful Historian ofthe transactions of those times, with pleasure and the warmest grati tude. In some remote time, the Macdonalds, of Glengary, having been injured, or offended by the inhabitants of Culloden, and resolving to have justice or ven geance, came to Culloden on a Sunday, where, finding their enemies at worship, they shut them up in the church, which they set on fire ; and hence the tune is remembered that the Piper played, while they were burning.

It is situate on the Northern bank ofthe Forth, upon the declivity of a steep hill, almost every house having a garden, and on the approach of it from the harbour, has a very picturesque appearance. It was erected into a Royal Borough, with extensive privileges, in 1588, by James the Sixth : and, in conjunction with Stirling, Iuver-Keithing, Dunfermlin, and South Queen's-Ferry, sends one Member to Parliament. The harbour is very safe, but, on account of some sunken recks opposite to the Town, it does not admit ships of large burden ; the spring tides rise here from 15 to 16 feet. Here is a regular Ferry daily over the Firth to Borrowstown-Ness. The Parish of Culross contains 8145 acres, Scotch measure : of which, nearly one-third to the North and West consist chiefly of marsh and muir, and a considerable portion of it has been planted Avith great success : toAvards the South, the soil is either a rich clay or dark loam , extremely fertile, and well cultivated. Here is abundance of free-stone, of an excellent quality ; together Avith coals, iron-stone, and some ochre. The Roads are bad. The Abbey of Culross, which Avas ofthe Cistertian Order, was founded in the year 1217, by Malcolm, Earl of Fife. The Conventual Church was not only dedicated to the Virgin Mary, but also to St. Servanus the Confessor, Avhose festival was annually kept on the first day of July, even long after the Reform ation : on which clay, the men and Avomen Avere accustomed to assemble early vol. i.

In 1609, Sir James Col ville, of Ochiltry, Avas created a Peer, by the title of Lord Colville, of Cul ross : at which time the King also granted to him this dissolved Abbey. It is said, that the Earls of Argyle, who, in ancient times, resided at Castle Camp bell, vvere Heritable Baillies of this Abbey, which office they disposed of to the Colvils, of Ochiltry, in whose family it continued until these Hereditary Juris dictions Avere abolished in 1748. The family of Argyle had an Aisle adjoin ing to the Abbey Church, in Avhich they sometimes used to bury ; and the ruins of it are still visible The Abbey of Culross was situate on an eminence, com manding a beautiful and extensive view of the Forth, and the coast on both sides : and considerable remains of it are yet extant. The Abbey Church stood on the North side of it, and had a tower in the middle, which Avas entire in the year 1789 ; as was also the West part of the Church, now used as the Paro chial Church. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. The Abbey of Culross (so called from its situation in the neighbourhood of the old Abbey) was built about the year 1590, by Edward, LordKiNLOSs, father to the Lord Bruce, Avho was slain in tlie noted duel between him and Sir Edward Sackville : this magnificent Mansion afterwards came by marriage into the Ancient and Noble family of Cochrane, Earl of Dundonald, whose Seat it now is. Upon the banks of the Forth, is Castlehill, anciently called Dunnemarle Castle, i. e. The Castle near the Sea, from a Fortress ofthe Macduffs, Thanes of Fife, and said to be their utmost boundary to the Westward : according to tradition, it was here that the cruel murder of Lady Macduff and her children was perpetrated, byorderof Macbeth; and Avhich forms such an affecting incident in Shake speare's fine tragedy of that name.

The surface has a romantic appear ance, being beautifully variegated by small hills and dales : the highest part is called Fanny-side- Muir , a very deep moss, producing nothing but heath : on the South, are two Lochs, about a mile long, and a quarter ofa mile broad ; the remainder is mostly arable, Avith a deep clay soil, tolerably fertile. The climate is sharp and cold, but not unhealthy. Peats are very plentiful ; and in the North part ofthe Parish, is abundance of coal, but none of it is worked at pre sent.

CUMBRAY, GREAT, ISLAND, in the Firth of Clyde, and Shire of Bute:"], [413, "CUM formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. Sterling: the manse is in good repair : the glebe consists of upwards of the legal quantity : Patron, The Earl of Glasgow: The Church, dedicated to St. Columba, was built in 1612, and is now too small to accommodate the Inhabitants. It is in the Presbytery of Irvine, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, Avas 506, and, in 1811, Avas 505. It is 2 m. W. from Largs. This Island is about 2\\ miles in length, and \\\\ mile in breadth, and contains about 2300 acres, one-third of which is cultivated. With a feAV excep tions, the hills rise with a gentle ascent to the centre of the Island, where they are elevated nearly 400 feet above the level ofthe sea: the soil is, in general, a gravelly loam, and in some places a mixture of clay. The air is pure, and salu brious. There is plenty of lime-stone, but the great expense of fuel has hitherto prevented its being used as a manure : tliere is also an inexhaustible fund of ex cellent free-stone ; and from these Quarries all the free-stone was taken, which was employed in erecting* the much improved Harbour of Port-Patrick. Fish of various kinds abound upon the coast. The whole Island belongs to The Earls of Glasgow, and Bute. The Parochial School is pretty well attended. The Ferry is often interrupted by storms : It is separated from Little Cumbray, on the South, by a Strait of three quarters of a mile in breadth ; and from the Isle of Bute, four miles, to the WestAvard. The increasing Village of Millport is plea santly situate to the Southward ofthe Island, and has a commodious dry Har bour, where in Spring tides there is water to the height of 10 or 12 feet along the shores : there is also a safe anchorage, which is sheltered by a small rocky Island : a considerable manufacture of coarse linen is carried on there. CUMBRAY, LITTLE, ISLAND, in the Firth of Clyde, and Shire of Bute. It constitutes part of the Parish of West Kill-Bride, in the Shire of Ayr. The Resident Population of this Island, in 1811, was 18; being inhabited by three Families only, one of which is employed in agriculture. It is about a mile in length, and half a mile in breadth ; and is separated from the Main-land by a Sound of about three miles across It lies in the parallel direction to Bute, from South-West to North-East. The strata of the rock, of which it is composed, are distinctly marked by nature. When viewed at a distance, they seem to lie nearly horizontal ; but, upon a nearer approach, they appear to incline to an angle of some eleA'ation . they begin from the water's edge, receding backwards from, and rising one above another to the summit, like the steps of stairs. Upon the South side are the Dwelling houses, and an old Gothic Castle, Avhich is situate"], [414, "CUM directly opposite to another ofthe same kind upon the Main-land. Concerning the antiquity ofthis Castle, nothing can now be learned, and no date or inscrip tion, from which it might be ascertained, has ever been discovered : It seems to have been a place of some strength, and is surrounded by a rampart and a fosse, over which there has been a draw-bridge : It Avas surprised and burned by the troops of Oliver Cromwell. The Island was then in the possession of the family of Eglintoune, in which it has continued ever since. Here are seven Caves ; but two of them are only remarkable for their size, and concerning their use, tradition conveys nothing certain, and the legendary tales of superstition respecting them, are too ridiculous to deserve notice. There are still the ruins ofa very ancient Chapel, which is said to have been dedicated to St. Vey, who lies interred near it : and which Avas probably a dependency of the celebrated Monastery of 1-Colm-Kill. Upon the most eminent Part ofthis Island, a Light- House was erected, about the year 1750, which has proved of great benefit to the trade ; but, from its too lofty situation, it is often so involved in clouds, as not to be perceptible, or, but seen very dimly. The Managers therefore judged it necessary to erect another upon a lower station, with a reflecting lamp, which is not liable to the inconvenience attending the former, and affords a more certain direction to Vessels navigating the Firth in the night time. It abounds with rabbits. CUMINE'S-TOWN, in the District of Turrets, and Shire of Aberdeen: in the Parish of Montquhitter. It is 6 m. E. b. N. from Turrets. This is a neat, and improving Village, which owes its erection, in 1739, to the active and pa triotic exertions of the late amiable Joseph Cumine, Esq., of Auchry; which estate bears ample testimony of the good sense of the owner, in the substantial improvements which he established here. CUMMERTREES, in the Shire of Dumfries : formerly a Vicarage, with the Chapelry of Trailtrow annexed; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3112.. 9. .7| in money, \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements, and \u00a337.. 10.. 4\\ by Parliamentary augmentation : the manse is in decent repair : the glebe con sists of 7 or 8 acres of rich land, and 16 acres lately obtained on a division of a Common in the neighbourhood : Patron, The CroAvn : The Church is in tolera ble condition.

This Parish is about 4 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth, being bounded by the Solway Firth on the South, and the river Annan"], [415, "CUM on the East, and contains nearly 7800 acres, by actual measurement. The sur face is level, and the soil is, in general, good ; especially in the centre of the Parish, Avhere it is remarkably fertile : great improvements in agriculture have lately been made here, and a large proportion of it is now inclosed. Fish is plentiful, and the price is moderate. Free-stone is abundant, and there is an inexhaustible lime-stone Quarry, of an excellent quality, near Killhead. The SalarY of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees. Considerable quantities of oat-meal, barley, and potatoes, are annually exported from Pow foot, a small Harbour at the entrance of the river Annan. The Roads are in tolerable repair. Peats are the only fuel used here. In the lime-stone Quarries of Kill-head, several veins of a beautiful dark coloured marble have appeared, Avhich admits of a fine polish, and large blocks have been worked up for chimnies and hearths. Hoddom Castle is delightfully situate on the South bank of the river Annan: tradition says, that it was built between the years 1437 and 1484, by John Lord Herrijes, of Herries, Avith the stones ofa more ancient Castle ofthe same name, Avlricn stood on the opposite side of the river. The Old Castle is said to have been inhabited about the beginning of the Fourteenth Century by a branch ofthe Family of Robert Bruce, and to have been demo lished some time after by a Border LaAv. The family of Herries Avas very powerful, and possessed a vast extent of country. About the year 1627, the Barony of Hoddom was acquired from the last Lord Hrrries, by Sir Richard Murray, of Cockpool: which family being afterwards created Earls of Annan dale, the estate stood vested in John, Earl of Annandale, in 1637. By the Earl of Annandale the estate was conveyed to David, Earl of Southesk, about the year 1653: and, in 1690, Charles, Earl of Southesk, sold the Barony and Castle to John Sharpe, Esq. ; in whose family it has continued ever since. Mr. Sharpe having repaired, and added several rooms to it, now resides in it with his family. Mr. Grose has preserved tAvo Views of this Castle. In the walls about it, are divers Roman Altars, and Inscriptions Avhich Avere discoA*ered at the Station at Burrens, in the Parish of Middlebie. See, Hoddom.

Coals, and lime-stone, are abundant: and, in the Barony of Aston, about three miles South-West from the Church, a lead mine is now AA-orked. It is Avatered by the Nith, and the Aston, and three small Lakes Avhich run into the Avater of Lugar. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites.

It is pleasantly situate at the confluence of the stream of Glisnock with the Lugar, and is well adapted for manufactures, from its vici nity to coals and water. Cumnock gives the title of Baron to the Ancient and Noble family of Crichton, Earl of Dumfries. This Parish is about 10 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth. The surface is mostly hilly; and the soil is in general a deep clay, except the holms, which are a light-dry loam. The climate is moist, but not unhealthy. Lime-stone, and free-stone, are abundant. The roads are in good repair. On the lands of Borland are the vestiges ofa Chapel, and the Farm is still called Chapel- House: these lands were originally in a family ofthe name of Hamilton, from whom they passed by marriage into the Mont gomerys, a branch of the Coylsfield family ; and having gone through different purchasers, are now the property of The Earl of Dumfries. The Castle of Terrenzean, now in ruins, is beautifully situate on an elevated bank above the Lugar ; this was the mansion ofthe Barony of that name, which passed succes sively from a branch ofthe Crawfords to the Boyds : upon their forfeiture, it fell to the CroAvn, who having successively made grants of it to different proprietors,"], [417, "CUP it came at last into the family of Loudon, from whom it was purchased by The Earl of Dumfries, and with whom it now remains : from this Barony, The Countess of Loudon takes the title of Baroness Terrenzean.

The Streets are well paved, and lighted, and the Town has much improved of late years. There is a Town-House, and a Steeple erected in 1762, on the spot where the Prison ofthe Court of Regality formerly stood. The Linen manufacture is carried on to a great extent : there is also a considerable tannery, and, in the immediate neighbourhood, a large bleachsield has been established. Here is a Stamp-Office. The climate is healthy. The vol. i. Z z"], [418, "CUP Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and a large and Avell lighted School. Fuel is scarce, and expensive. The Parish of Cupar is about 5 miles in length, and from one to two miles in breadth: it is divided lengthways by an elevated ridge ; on the Northern side of which, lie the Haughs of Isla, that are subject to frequent inundations : the soil is, in general, a clayey loam, but Avhere-ever the ground rises into eminences, a gravely soil makes its appearance ; the lands are mostly inclosed with thorn hedges, and agriculture is well attended to. The Roads are in good repair. The Earl of Moray is the chief Proprietor. Here are still visible the vestiges of a Roman Camp, which is said to have been formed by the army of Agricola, in his Seventh expedition; and here one half of the Roman army is supposed tohav*e encamped, while the other half remained at Camp Muir, a village nearly two miles South- West from this place: In the centre of this Camp, Malcolm the Fourth, in 1164, founded, and richly endoAved, an Abbey for Cistertian Monks ; and from Avhat remains, it must have been a House of considerable magnitude. The Hays, of Errol, next to the Scottish Kings, were the principal Benefactors to this Monastery. Upon the Distribution, made by King James the Sixth, of the Lands which came to the Crown on the Dissolution of the Religious Houses, His Majesty erected this Abbey into a Civil Lordship, in favour of James Elphinston, Son of James Lord Balmerino, in 1606, but he dying without issue in 1669, the honour devolved to the Lord Balmerino, whose family was attainted in 1745.

S., in April, the 10th of May, and the last Wednesday, O. S., in May, the 25th, O. S., of July, the first Thursday, O. S., in October, and the 11th, O. S., of November. This Town is beautifully situate on the Northern bank ofthe river Eden, at its junction with"], [419, "CUP the water of St. Mary. It boasts of great antiquity ; the Thanes of Fife, from the earliest times of which any account has been transmitted to us, held here their Courts of Justice; and, in the Rolls of Parliament, assembled iu the beginning ofthe reign of King David the Second, maybe seen the names ofthe Commissioners from the Royal Burgh of Cupar. It is at present governed by a Provost, 3 Baillies, a Dean of Guild, 13 Guild Counsellors (who are self-elected), and 8 Trades' Counsellors, or Deacons, who are elected by the eight Incorpora tions.

The Schools of Cupar have long been in high repute : the Salary of the Rector of the Grammar School is \u00a340. ; and that ofthe Master ofthe English School is \u00a330.; (both of which are paid by The Toavh Council), together with School-fees. The Schools are kept in a convenient and handsome building, erected in the year 1727, by the Magistrates and Council, in a very pleasant and airy situation upon the Castle-Hill : and an elegant additional School-House has recently been built. The climate is extremely salubrious : and, according to tradition, when the neighbouring Palace of Falkland was a Royal Residence, their children, in order to enjoy the purity of the air of Cupar, had apartments fitted up for them in the Religious House belonging to the Benedictines, now pulled down, and an elegant new Street opened on its site. The Parish of Cupar is an irregular Square of about five miles, which is divided into two parts by the river Eden. The soil is various, and agriculture is now much attended to. The turn-pike roads are in excellent repair. The Castle, which is now completely demolished, was for many ages the chief residence ofthe poAverful Earls of Fife. The House of Carslogie is an ancient edifice, and was originally a place of great strength : this ancient and respectable family have, for time immemorial, been in posses sion of a hand, curiously formed of steel ; which is said to have been conferred by one of the kings of Scotland, along with other more valuable marks of his favour, on the Laird of Carslogie, who had lost his hand in the service of his country. Garlie Bank, the property of James Wemyss, Esq., of Winthank, is celebrated for the treaty concluded there, on the 13th of June 1559, between the Duke de Chattelherault, oji the part of the Queen Regent, and the Earl of Argyle, who commanded the forces of the Congregation. The Knights Zz2"], [420, "CUR Templars had considerable landed possessions adjacent to Cupar, on the South : and there are still two Houses, in different parts of the Toavii, called Temple Tenements, which belonged to that Order : they now hold of John Ferguson, Esq., of .S1.. Catharine's, and enjoy all the privileges and exemptions usually attached to the possessions of the Templars. The only Religious House Avhich existed in Cupar, at the time ofthe Reformation, was a Convent of Dominican, or Black Friars : it was situate at the foot ofthe Castle-hill, and was connected Avith the Castle ; having been founded by the Macduffs, Earls of Fife : it Avas afterwards annexed to St. Monan's, and had a fine Chapel of free stone, Avhich Avas much decayed before the annexation. Theatrical representations, called Mysteries, or Moralities, were frequently exhibited here ; and the place, Avher e these entertainments were performed, Avas called The Play-field, Avhich was near the Castle-Hill. CUPAR GRANGE, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Bendothy. It is 2 m. N. E. from Cupar of Angus. It is famous for a particular kind of seed oats. Here is a Ferry over the river Eroch, for foot passengers. CURGARFF, v. STRATHDON. CURGIE, BAY, v. KIRK-MAIDEN. CURRIE, anciently KILL-LEITH, in the Shire of Edinburgh : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, including a glebe of4 acres, was \u00a3156., paid partly in grain, and partly in money : Patrons, The Town Council of Edin burgh : The present Church is a neat modern Edifice. It is in the Presbytery of Edinburgh, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Village of Balerno) was 1112, and, in 1811, was 1321. It is 6 m. S. W. from Edinburgh. This Parisii is about five or six miles in every direction ; but its greatest extent is from East to West, Avhere it advances to 9 miles in length. The situation is very elevated ; Ravelrig, about the middle of the Parish, is 800 feet above the leA*el ofthe sea : this height, and its vicinity to the range of the Pentland hills, renders it cold, and damp. The soil is a tough clay, which requires much cultivation ; about one-third ofthe Avhole is hill, and moss ; the manure employed is often brought from Edinburgh, but lime is more generally used. The Village of Currie, where the ancient Church stood for ages, is situate on both sides of the river Leith, which here runs in a deep channel betAveen steep banks. Limestone is abundant, but is not worked, as there is no coal at a nearer distance than 8 or 9 miles ; but, there is every reason to suppose, that Avhile all the neighbouring Parishes abound with"], [421, "c u s coal, this also contains the same mineral, if proper trials were made. Here are two Paper-Mills, and a very extensive Spinning-Mill. At the village of Balerno, a free-stone quarry has been worked for some years, and many of the buildings in The New Town of Edinburgh have been supplied from it. The Salary ofthe Schoolmaster is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites. The Roads are uncommonly good. Services of every kind are here abolished, except upon two estates, where the servants drive all the coals, and the cottagers are bound to assist in cutting down the crops ofthe Landlord. Currie may be con sidered as classic ground, being* situate in the neighbourhood of that little romantic Dale, where Allan Ramsay is said to have laid the Scene of \" The Gentle Shepherd,\" the favourite Pastoral of the Scottish Nation. On the estate of Captain Scott, of Maleny, are the remains of an old Castle, commonly called Lennox Tower, said to have belonged to the family of Lennox, and to have been the occasional residence of Mary Queen of Scots, perhaps \" When love was young, and Darnley kind.\" It became afterwards, according to tradition, a Seat of the Regent Morton : it stands on a very elevated situation, above the bank of the river, commanding a beautiful prospect ofthe Firth of Forth, and, in those times, must have been a place of considerable strength, being inaccessible on all sides : the circumference of the rampart is 912 feet: it had a subterraneous passage to the riv*er, which has only been shut up Avithin these' fe av years, to preserve the cattle from acci- dents. Not far from this Castle, on the opposite side of the river, are the ruins of another ancient edifice, the Mansion of the Skenes, of Currie-Hill, avIio possessed very extensive estates in this Parish. The Family of Balmerino had also here a considerable domain.

The climate is rainy, but not unhealthy. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School -fees, and perquisites, and a free house, and garden. In 1680, Bargeny gave the title of Baron to the family of Hamilton, noAv extinct or dormant. The Castle of Dunure is a fine old building, most romanticly situate on the brink ofa perpendicular rocky cliff, in some parts over-hanging the sea : beneath it is a cavern, called The Broicneys Cave, now nearly filled up with rubbish that has fallen from the rock and building ; it is said to have formerly communicated with the Castle, and probably served as a Sally-port, or secret communication with the sea. This Castle was an ancient residence of a principal branch of the Kennedy family, who were thence called Kennedys, of Dunure, and generally esteemed the head of that name : The Cassilis family is descended from it, and were Proprietors of this estate until the beginning of the Eighteenth century, when it was sold to an ancestor of the present Proprietor, who was also a descendant from the Kennedys, of Dunure. Mr. Grose has preserved two views of it. The ancient Castle of Dalquharran, situate on the Western bank ofthe river Girvan, is also the property ofthe Kennedys, of Dunure; who have erected a handsome House, of the castellated form, in the adjacent demesnes, after a design by Mr. Adams.

DALRY, in the District of Cuninghame, and Shire of Ayr : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : the manse, and offices, were built in 1766: the glebe consists of about 7 Scotch acres, of arable land : Patron, Mr. Blair, of Blair : The Church was built in 1771. It is in the Pres bytery of Irvine, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 2321, and, in 1811, was 2815. It is 4\\ m. S. W. from Beith. This Parish is about 9 miles in length, and nearly the same in breadth. The surface rises gradually from the banks of the rivers Caas Rye, and Garnock, with which it is watered :,the low grounds along the Garnock are exceedingly fertile, but the greater part of the soil is clay, upon a cold till bottom. Agriculture is much attended to here. The roads, and bridges, are in good repair. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, a dwelling, and garden. Coals, lime-stone, and iron-stone, are in plenty. Dairy gives the title of Baron to the Ancient and Noble family of Boyle, Earl of Glasgow. DALRY, in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright : formerly a Rectory, and Prebend, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., together with \u00a38..6..8. for Communion elements *. the manse was built in 1784 : the glebe contains about 11 acres : Patron, Sir J.

The \u2022 vol. i. 3 B"], [434, "DAL Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (including the Village of St. John's Clauchan) was 832, and, in 1811, Avas 1061. It is 3 m. N W. b. N. from New Galloway. This Parisii is about 15 miles in length, and 10 miles in breadth: towards the South, the soil is abundantly capable of cultivation ; but by far the greater part ofthe surface is hilly, and appropriated to pasturage. Along the river Ken, which is the principal river, and Avhich is the boundary on the West, for upwards of six miles, there are some natural woods of considerable extent; especially at Earlston, so called, according to tradition, from its having been a Hunting-Seat of The Earl of Bothwell, the Husband of Queen Mary. The river Ken, although generally, is not always the boundary between this Parish and Kells ; for tliere is apart of Dairy, consisting of a piece of fine Holm, called Tlte Mukle Isle, on the West side of the river, formerly the property of The Earl of Galloway, and now of Sir William Millar, of Glenlee. The Lakes, and rivers, abound with trout. In Lochinvar, are the remains of an ancient fortified Castle, which is said to have belonged to the Gordons, anciently Knights of Lochinvar, and Viscounts of Kenmure, attainted in 1715. In the Church-yard, there is an Aisle of the old Church, noAV quite detached from the new one, which is the Burial-place of the family of Kenmure : there is also a square piece of inclosed ground, with a blackish wall about 7 feet high, with a bowl supported by a standard at each corner, which is the Burying place of the Newalls, of Barskeoch. Many of the lands in this Parish have changed their proprietors within these few years ; the estate of the family of Kenmure now belongs, by purchase, to Mr. Oswald, of Auchincruive; as do those of four other Gentle men, to Mr. Forbes, of Callendar. Mr. Alexander, of Mackilston, and Mr. Hunter, of Lochinvar, are the only two Resident Heritors. The Salary of the Parochial School arises from a fund of about \u00a31000., which was bequeathed by a Mr. Johnston, to erect a School-house, and to maintain a School -master capable of teaching Latin, together with Candlemas offerings ; and it is well conducted. Fuel is expensive. The Roads are in tolerable repair. A Bridge over the Ken, between this Parish and Kells, would be of great advantage to the Public, as the river is sometimes impassable even with boats. Some parts ofthe Parish of Carse-Fairn still pay Stipend to the Ministers of Dairy, and Kells, respectively. DALRYMPLE, in the District of Kyle, and Shire of Ayr : formerly aVicar age, the Stipend of Avhich, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : the manse was built in 1728: the glebe is extremely small : Patron, The Crown: The Church was built in"], [435, "DAL 1764.

This Parish is about 7 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth, stretching along the banks of the river Doon, where the grounds are particularly beautiful. The soil is partly clay, and partly sand ; and agriculture is now much attended to. Coals, lime, marl, and free-stone are abundant. The roads are good. There are the remains of three old Castles ; one of Avhich, called Barbiston, is said to have been the place of conflict between two ofthe family of Barbiston, and Kennedy, in which the latter was slain. Dalrymple gives the title of Viscount to The Earl of Stair. D ALSERF, in the Middle Ward, and Shire of Lanark : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was ten chalders of victual, and \u00a350. in money, besides the usual allowance for Communion elements : the manse, which is delightfully situate, has lately undergone a thorough repair: the glebe consists of 4\\ acres, besides grass-ground : Patron, The Duke of Hamilton : The Church is in tolerable condition. It is inthe Presbytery of Hamilton, and Synod of Glasgow one. Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (con taining the Villages of Dalserf, Lark-Hall, and Mill-Heugh) was not retumtd ; but, in 1792, it contained 1100 persons, and, in 1811, the Population Was 1660. It is 5 m. S. E. from Hamilton. This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth. It is watered by the rivers Avon, and Clyde; the latter of which is subject to inundations. Along the banks ofthe rivers, the soil is fruitful, and well cultivated. There is a Ferry-boat upon the Clyde, near the Church ; and an Act of Parliament has lately been obtained, for building a Bridge about a quarter of a mile below the Ferry. The climate is tolerably dry, and salu brious. Tbe Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites. Coals, iron-stone, and free-stone, are in great abundance. Here are several extensive plantations. Dalserf House, the resi dence of Mr. Hamilton Dalserf, a Minor, is a neat modern building, situate upon an eminence near the village, and commanding a charming prospect along the Clyde. Broom-Hill House now belongs to Mrs. Mitchelson, a Lady of eminent worth, and widow ofthe late Samuel Mitchelson, Clerk to the Signet. It was formerly the Seat of the ancient Family of the Hamiltons, of Broom- Hill, (the elder branch of which were created Lords Belhaven) ; it stands on the margin of the river Avon, in a fine airy situation, and has a most agreeable view of the adjacent country Besides these two Houses, there is, on the estate of 3B2"], [436, "DAL Dalserf an elegant modern mansion, called Milburn- House, which commands a most delightful vieAv of the vale of Clyde, and the adjacent country. This Parish is famous for its abundance of excellent fruit, particularly Plums. In a beautiful Valley upon the Clyde, are the vestiges of a Chapel, which was dedi cated to St. Patrick, and from whence the Dale takes the name of Dalpatrick : there was also another, about a mile distant, upon the side ofa rivulet ; which from thence gets the name of Chapel-Burn. DALSWINTON, in the Shire of Dumfries ; and in the Parish of Kirk- Mahoe. It is 4f m. N. from Dumfries. This is an improving Village; with a private School, to the support of which Mr. Miller very generously contributes. The ancient Castle of Dalswinton, which Avas long the chief seat of the family of Cumming, having fallen to decay, an elegant and commodious Mansion has been erected on its site by Patrick Miller, Esq., the present Proprietor of this great Estate, and which he is rapidly improving with much taste and judgment. DALTON, in the Shire of Dumfries : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. Sterling in money: the manse is in decent repair: the glebe consists of more than the legal extent: Patron, Mr. Macrae, of Hol mains: The Church is in tolerable condition. It is in the Presbytery of Loch maben, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (consisting of Meikle, and Little Dalton) was 595, and, in 1811, was 691. It is 1\\ m. N. W. from Annan. This Parish is about 4 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth, and contains about 4500 Scotch acres. The soil consists chiefly of a light sandy loam, and, when properly cultivated, is very abundant. It is bounded by the river Annan on the East, which affords considerable quantities of salmon, and sea-trout. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with a few School-fees. The Roads are in tolerable repair. Peats are the common fuel.

It is in the Pres- bytery of Hamilton, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 611, and, in 1811, was 758. Itis 4 m. E. from Hamilton. This Parish contains about 2289 Scotch acres. The soil is a rich loam, and strong marly clay, and is capable of a high state of cultivation. It is watered by the rivers Clyde, and Calder, the banks of which are beautifully ornamented by exten- sive Plantations. Coal abounds in the Parish, but is not worked at present : there are also free-stone quarries, of excellent quality. The legal Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, besides which, the Master has School-fees from a numerous class of Scholars, and a dwelling;, and garden. The climate is healthy. The roads, and bridges, are in good repair. The great Roman Road, called the Wailing Street, passed through the Parish ; and at the Western boundary, upon a steep bank over the river Calder, are the Remains of a Roman encampment : there is also a semicircular arch over the river, which has been supposed to be of Roman construction. On the banks ofthe Clyde, Avhere they are steep and precipi- tous, and tastefully laid out in Avalks, amongst shrubbery and fruit trees, upon the site ofa Roman castellum, the late Mr. Hamilton, of Dalziel, erected a small build- ing, which commands some of the most delightful prospects in the County. This Barony was vested in the family of Dalziel by a Charter from King Robert the Third, in 1395, and, in 17 15, it was forfeited. By an old Charter still extant, it ap- pears that it had before been in the hands of a family of the name of Sandilands, in the reign of Malcolm Canmore, and had afterwards come to be in the gift of the Crown. There is a tradition, that, at an early period, a Baron of the name of Nisbit also held some part of the Parish ; and, upon the bank, opposite to that on which the present Manor- House stands, are the foundations of a square build- ing, which is said to have been his residence. The Dalziels retained these lands until the year 1600, when they were sold to James Hamilton, the brother of Sir John Hamilton, of Orbiston, who was Lord Justice Clerk in the reign of Charles the First ; and a descendant of that Gentleman is the present pro prietor. Mr. Hamilton holds the whole Parish immediately of the Crown, and is proprietor of about 21 13 acres of it ; and the remainder is holden of him in feu."], [438, "D A V DAMSA, ISLE, one of the Orkneys ; and constituting part of the Parish of Firth. This is a beautiful little Island, scarcely a mile in c'.rcu nserence, situate in the bosom of the Bay of Firth. For some time past it has been uncul tivated ; but, from the nature ofthe soil, and the thick SAvard of fine grass which it produces, it evidently is fit both for grain and other articles, in such abundance as Avould liberally revvard the hand of industry. From the singlar beauty of its appearance, it has sometimes been styled The Tempe of the Islands. It formerly contained a Castle, which was reputed to be of great strength. There was also a Church here, said to have been dedicated to the Virgin Mary, by whose influ ence, according to the credulity of ancient times, many wonders were performed : this fabric, with all its mighty miracles, has noAv almost sunk into oblivion ; and the Island is applied to the pasturing of a few hundreds of sheep, Avhich are taken care of by one solitary family : And, as if it still retained some of its primitive innocence and virtue, it is believed, as heretofore, to refuse its support to any kind of noxious animal. Its most valuable quality at present, is the production ofa plentiful store of sea- Aveed, from which are burnt ten tons of kelp annually. DANESHALT, in the District of Cupar, and Shire of Fife; in the Parish of Auchtermuchty. It is 2 j m. N. from Falkland.

A considerable quantity of salt is manufactured here ; and immense quantities of"], [439, "D A V coals are annually exported from the pits, belonging to Sir John Henderson, Bart. , of Forlel, at the distance of four miles ; and from whence there is a regular waggon-way to the Harbour. DAVIOT, in the District of Garioch, and Shire of Aberdeen: formerly a Rectory, belonging to the Treasurer of Aberdeen ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a391. .5.. 8\u00a3 in money, including \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements, 52 bolls 1 firlot 3 pecks and fof a lippie of meal, 6 bolls of bear, and \u00a311.. 16.. 2\\ by Parliamentary augmentation, and a glebe : the manse is in tolerable repair : Patron, The Crown: The Church is in decent condition. It is in the Presbytery of Garioch, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 644, and, in 1811, was 693. It is 5 m. N.W. from Meldrum. This Parish is about 3\u00a7- miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth, exclusive ofthe seve ral lands in the Parishes of Chapel, and Fyvie, which are annexed to Daviot, quoad sacra. The soil is partly a strong clay, and partly a rich loam, and in general abundantly fertile, and early. Peats, and turf, are the principal fuel. There are two Druidical temples, one of which makes part ofthe Church-yard. DAVIOT, in the Shire of Inverness: formerly a Rectory, with the ancient Rectory of Dunlichty united about the year 1618 ; the Stipend of which, in 181 1, was \u00a377.. 6.. 0., no part whereof is victual, and the Parishioners are not bound to perform any Services to the Minister : Patron, The Crown : The Church, and manse of Daviot, which were built in 1763 and 1764, and have had frequent repairs since, are now in bad condition : The Churches of Daviot, and Dunlichty, are 7 miles distant ; and Divine Worship is performed alternately in them every Sunday : they have each a glebe, but neither of them are ofthe legal extent. It is in the Presbytery of Inverness, and Synod of Moray. - The Resident Popula tion of the United Parishes, in 1801, was 1818, and, in 1811, was 1634. It is 5 m. S. E. from Inverness. These Parishes lie nearly due East and West on both sides of the river Nairn, being about 23 miles im length, and from \\~ to 4 miles in breadth. The appearance is Avild and romantic in the highest degree, the hills being either bare rocks, or very sparingly covered with coarse grass : and, in the low grounds, there are many large tracts of peat-moss, incapable of cultivation ; but which seem in general well calculated for the growth of Forest trees, with which many acres have lately been planted, and are in a flourishing state. The soil is various ; being in some places sandy and light, and, in others, spongy and wet, with a clay bottom. The different measures or quantities of land are here denominated Davochs, Ploughs and Auchten parts, and are in an"], [440, "D E A arbitrary and uncertain proportion. FeAv of the Tenants occupy more than one Auchten part, the rent of which is from \u00a33. to \u00a35. Sterling. Customs and Ser vices, or Money conversions in lieu of them, are always exacted, and paid over and above the stipulated Rent. The climate, though very variable, is healthy. At The Mains of Daviot , a Seat of the ancestors of the present Laird of Mackintosh, the Chief of that ancient and powerful Clan, tliere were, until lately, the ruins of a Fort or Castle, which was built by The Earl of Craavfurd, in the beginning of the Fifteenth Century : it was of great extent, and part of the stones were lately employed in building a modern House, and Offices, near its site. Among the mountains are several Lakes, of which Loch Ruthven, Loch Duntelchack, and Loch Clachan, are the principal ; and all of them, especially the first, abound with trout of a delicious flavour. Under the auspices of The Parlia mentary Commissioners, an excellent line of road has been made, from near the Kirk of Daviot, on the Moy road, a little South ofthe water of Na im, through Strath-Nairn to the Bridge of Inver- Far igag and Loch Ness, with a small branch WestAA'ard near Toredaroch, a distance of 19s miles. At the South end, this road extends about half a mile from the bridge of Inver-Farigag to Loch Ness side, Avhere a small natural Cove in the rock is improved by a Pier for landing manure, and shipping the produce of the country; thus furnishing a ready communication with the Caledonian Canal. DAWICK, in the Shire of Peebles : formerly a Vicarage : The ruins of the Church stood on Scrape-Burn, about a quarter of a mile Soutlnvard from New- Posso. This ancient, Parish was suppressed, in 1742, when the Southern half of it was annexed to Drummelzier, and the Northern half to Stobo. According to Mr. Chalmers, Dawick, is the abbreviated pronunciation of Dalwick, which, in the Anglo-Saxon, signifies The Dwelling in the Dale. There are still two Hamlets, named East Dawick, and West Dawick, in the old Parish, which lay along the South-East side of the Tweed. DEAD RIGGS, v. ECCLES. DEAD WATER, v. CASTLE-TOWN. DEAL. v.

DEER-NESS, in the Island of Pomona, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shetland : formerly a Vicarage, united to the ancient Vicarage cf St. Andrew's, at Avhich the Minister officiates alternately \u25a0:\" the glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Patron, Lord Dundas : The Church is dedicated to St. Peter, and is, by land, 84 miles distant from the manse, with a bad road. It is in the Pres- bytery of Kir kwall, and Synod of Orkney. The Parish of Deer-Ness forms a Peninsula; which, from the Mull-Head to the Isthmus that divides it from the Parish of St. Andrew's, is in length upwards of four miles, and varies in breadth from one to three, chiefly on account ofthe large and beautifully winding Harbour of Deer Sound. This Harbour, which separates the United Parishes, is nearly in the direction of North-East and South-West, four miles long, and from one to two and a half broad. Its entrance is from the North ; and, as it is surrounded with land on every side, has a bottom of clay mixed with sand, and a sufficient depth of water, it constitutes an excellent Harbonr. The Resident Population ofthe Parish of Deer-Ness, in 1801, was 660, and, in 1811, was 620. Around the shores, the soil is mostly sandy ; higher up, it is loam and clay; and the middle of the Parish is extremely boggy, and Avet. Agriculture is not much attended to here. Some of the Ships bound for Davis's Straits, and those that go to Iceland, put in here to engage seamen for tl>3 voyage. Near the top of The Mull, and the boundary of the Mainland to the North-East, a Chapel had been erected, the access to which is equally difficult and dangerous; and this circumstance, perhaps, no less than other motives, might have contributed to render it a place of devout pilgrimage, into Avhich people took great delight frequently to scramble, in order to perform their vows, and leave their super stitious oblations : but, for some time past, these irrational practices have been discontinued. Here are several Tumuli, and near the end of the isthmus which vol. i. 3 C"], [442, "DEE unites St. AndreAv's to Deer -Ness, are the remains of a very large Pict's House, commonly called Dingy's How, or Duncan's Height. Deer-Ness is very con veniently situate for a fishing Station. On the sand and shores, are seen myriads of Plovers, CurleAvs, Sea- larks, Sea-pies, and a large grey bird with a hoarse cry, called by the inhabitants The Horra Goose. The Society for propagating Christian Knowledge have a School here, with a Salary of \u00a315. This District is connected Avith the Main-land only by a narroAV and sandy Isthmus. Here very strong ropes, calculated for different purposes in husbandry, are made of the shoots ofthe crowberry -heath, or empetrum nigrum. The ropes for hanging the Caseys, or baskets, OA*er the horses' backs, are made ofthe fibrous roots of sea reed, or arundo arenaria. Tethers, and bridle-reins, are made of long meadoAv grasses, such as holcus lanatus, which here receive the name of pounce, or puns. DEER, NEW, anciently AUCHREDDY, inthe District of Deer, and Shire of Aberdeen: formerly part of the Parisii of Old Deer, from which it was disjoined, and erected into a separate Parisii in the beginning ofthe Seventeenth century; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 4 chalders of meal, 600 merks Scotch, and \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements : the manse, and offices, are in good repair : the glebe consists of about 4-j acres : Patron, The Crown : The Church is in good condition.

A General Post- Office is established here. The Fairs are holden on the first Tuesday, O. S., in April, the second Tuesday, O. S., in June, and the second Tuesday, O. S., in October. This Parish is about 14 miles in length, and 7 miles in breadth. The surface is flat, and for several miles it is one continued corn-field ; toAvards the West, it is heath and moor, and the soil is shallow, and barren. Peat-moss is in abundance. The air is sharp and pure, often attended Avith partial and heavy shoAvers. Here are several cairns, and Druidical circles. The public roads are in good repair. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, a good dwelling, and a rood of land. Lime-stone is in great plenty. About tAvo miles North from the Church, stand the ruins of the old Castle of Fedderatt, Avhich appears to have been a place of considerable strength : according to tradition, it Avas built by a person of the name of Crawford; it afterwards came into the possession of the Irvines, of Drum, and is now the properly of The Earl of Aberdeen : this is also said to have been one ofthe last strong-holds ofthe partisans of James the Second, who, after the"], [443, "DEE battle of Killycrankie, possessed themselves of Fyvie Castle, and, being obliged to abandon it, took refuge in Fedderatt ; but were pursued, and expelled by King William's troops. In the West side of the Parish, is an extensive piece of moor, called Bruce- Hill ; it is said to have been so named from Edward, brother to King Rober\"* Bruce, who encamped there soon after the battle of Inverury ; and Avho marched from thence against Cuaiyn, Earl of Buchan, in 1308, whom he defeated at a place called Aiky-Brae, or Oaky-Brae : in memory of this victory, the Market of Aiky, on the second Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, O. S., of July, is said to have been established, and upon the same spot Avhere the battle was fought.

The Village of Old Deer, which is very ancient, is pleasantly situate upon the Northern bank of the river Deer, a tributary stream of the Ugie, and upon the estate of Mr. Russel, of Moncoff er. Not far from it, are the ruins ofthe Abbey, which Avas built in the beginning of the Thirteenth Century, by William Cumyn, Earl of Buchan, for some Monks ofthe Cistertian Order: in 1587, the lands which belonged to it, were erected into a Temporal Lordship in favour of Robert Keith, Commendator of Deer, and son to William the Sixth EarlMARiscHAL, by the stile and title of Lord Altrie; Avho, dying without male issue, his estate, and honours, accordingly devolved on George Earl Marischal. This Parish is about 10 miles in length, and 5s- miles in breadth, being situate almost in the centre of the District of Buchan. The surface is uneven, buj 3C2"], [444, "DEL many of the hills are either cultivated, or planted ; and the loAver grounds are well adapted either for corn or pasture.

Several Services, ancl mill multures, are still retained here. Spinning, and knitting, form thc chief employ ment ofthe women. Here are inexhaustible Quarries of excellent lime-stone ; and abundance of fine granite. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, a dwelling, and a rood of land. The climate is healthy. Game, of all kinds, is in great plenty ; and, as the streams abound with salmon, and excellent trout, angling is a favourite diversion. Here are several cairns, and Druidical circles.

It is situate upon the Firth of Moray, and consists ofthe estates of East and West Delnies. DELORANE, in the Shire of Selkirk ; and in the Parisii of Etterick. It is 17 m. S. W. from Selkirk. In 1706, Henry Scott, the second Son of The Duke of Monmouth and the rich Countess of Buccleugh, was created Earl of Delorane. In 1807, this title became extinct. DELTING or DELL-TAING, inthe Mainland, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shetland : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of Avhich, in 1811, Avas, ac cording to the report of the Minister to the Court of Teinds, \u00a380. Sterling, including \u00a34.. 3. .4. modified for Communion elements, and that he found it necessary to agree with his Heritors, and to accept this sum for his Avhole Sti pend : he adds, that there is \u00a324.. 7.. 11| of unexhausted Teind ; but there is no decreet of valuation on record: Patron, Lord Dundas : there are two Churches, the principal one being about seven, and the other three miles from the manse ; but both of them are in extremely bad order. It is in the Presbytery of Shet land, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1449, and, in 1811, was 1624. It is bounded on the West by a long nar roAv isthmus, called Sulom Voe. This is a very extensive Parish, and is much intersected by Bays, no part of it being above two miles from the sea. The appearance of the country is hilly, bleak, and barren : but the hills afford plenty of excellent peats, which are an article \u00abjf no small importance in such a high Latitude, and under such inclement skies. That part of the Parish which is"], [445, "DEL under cultivation, and which bears but a very small proportion to tlie Avaste and uncultivated part, produces, in good seasons, very tolerable crops of barley, a kind of black oats, and abundance of potatoes : Wheat is not knoAvn in the Parish. The old and standing mode of measurement is by merks of land, Avhich are of very different sizes in different parts, according to their excellence. The lands have been, for time immemorial, diviJed into 12 penny, 9 penny, and 6 penny land: in a fe av. instances, some ofthe 12 penny land has been measured, and was found to be three-quarters of an acre to each merk, and 6 penny land half an acre to each merk, What is called the rentaled land of the'Parish amounts to 854 merks of land, or about 600 acres : besides this, there are many outsets or new improvements, which are made by the Proprietors, in order to find a settlement for the young men who marry, and whom they cannot accommodate with settlements on rentaled or improved lands. The marches of the Pastures of the different towns or farms, are very imperfectly ascertained. Besides the land rents and services payable to the Proprietors by the tenants, certain payments are also claimed by Lord Dundas, called Scat, Wattle, and Qx-penny ; but these payments are very various. In this Parish, every labourer, and Avork men of all kinds, are maintained inthe family where they are employed. Peat is the only fuel. The air is moist, but not unhealthy. The Fisheries are princi pally attended to here. There are several creeks and harbours in the Parish, in all of Avhich tliere is safe anchorage for vessels of considerable burden ; espe cially in Busta Voe, South Voeter, Alnafirth, El wick, and Mavisgrind. Here is a set of very old regulations, called Country Acts ; by one of Avhich itis enacted, that no pair shall marry, unless they be possessed of \u00a340. Scots of free gear : this regulation, as well as all the rest, is -now not enforced ; though all of them appear to have been well calculated. for the good Police ofthe country. A great many young men from this Paris? h annually engage with the Greenland Ships, which touch at Brissay Sound, on their outward passage in the months of March aud April ; many of them are afterwards landed on the Island, when the ships, return from Greenland ; and several at length enter into the navy. The tenantry here, says Mr. Neill, p. 97 ; \" look up to the .Shetland landlord from a state, generally, of hopeless poverty and abject dependance ; for, if they are not tenants at will, they seldom hold leases of more than tAvo or three years ; and they are often drowned in debt to their Lairds. It is the Landlord's interest that his tenants should be fed, and should multiply; he takes care, accordingly, that, even in times of scarcity, none shall perish for want, and he encourages"], [446, "DEL marriage. But, in some other points, the Shetland landlord's interest has been thought to run almost directly counter to that of the tenant ; and here his over whelming influence must secure him success. For example, it has been thought to be against his interest, that his tenants should attain in any degree that en vied state of independence Avhich is the grand motive of every description of tenants in the South of Scotland, and Avhich animates the exertions even of a Moss-Laird in Stirlingshire. Although, therefore, it is by no means an avowed principle, it has been alledged to be a practical one, with the Shetland land holders, to keep their tenants as poor and as dependant as possible. ' They must fish for their masters'. Every tenant, or at least every cottar-tenant, is expected to fish during summer. And, as a striking proof of the subjection in which the Shetland cottars are held, I may mention as an undoubted fact, that for every lad Avho goes to the Greenland-whale fishery for the summer, the cottar family to which he belongs must pay to the landlord one guinea of fine. This is an exaction which the landlords who practise it, may Avell Avish to slur over : but, if the fine be not levied avowedly on that ground, we have been credibly informed that a guinea is always added to that year's rent, and that the reason ofthe addi tion is perfectly understood by both parties.\" And at p. 112, the same benevolent and patriotic Gentleman observes, \" as an indubitable proof that it does exist, and that it is not a private bargain with the tenant, but an arbitrary and fluc tuating imposition, I have now to state, on the best authority, that Advertise ments were, last Spring (1805), affixed to some ofthe Parish Church doors of Shetland, informing the Poor Shetlanders belonging to particular estates, that no permission would henceforth be granted them to go to the Whale fishery, under Three guineas, instead of one ! \u2014 It may be proper here to repeat what I formerly hinted, that several of the Shetland landlords have disdained, AT ALL TIMES, TO MAKE THE UNEQUAL BARGAIN IN QUESTION WITH THEIR POOR and dependant Tenantry.\" \u2014 There are no bridges, nor so much as the outline of a road, in any part ofthe Island. Here are the remains of three Picts' Houses. The Gifford Family, of Busta, have been Proprietors and possessed of great property there. In Nichols's Bibliotheca Topographica Britannica, vol v., is \" An Historical Description of the Zetland Islands,\" by the late Thomas Gif ford, Esq., of Busta, who was a very respectable gentleman, generous to his tenants and servants, and a very useful Member of Society : His Lady was sister to the late Sir Andrew Mitchell, of Westshore. The present Laird's ( 1786) Grandfather had three sons, who were lost in a boat crossing a bay in the month"], [447, "DEN of June, 1746: His father was not then born; he succeeded to the Grand father's estate on his descease. It is remarked, that the Morton family got the Superiorities of Orkney and Zetland, which belonged to The Earl of Orkney, after his forfeiture, as a pledge for \u00a330,000., (which his predecessors had ad vanced to the Royal Family, during the reigns of Queen Mary, James the Sixth, and Charles the First), which was granted to James Earl of Morton in the year 1741 or 1742, by King George the Second in a perpetual free gift, and in 1767 Avas sold for \u00a363,000. to Sir Laurence Dundas, whose son Thomas Lord Dundas now inherits that property. The present Laird is Gideon Gifford, Esq., of Busta. DELVIN, v. CAPUTH. DENBOIG, v. DUNBOG. DENHOLM, in the District of Hawick, and Shire of Roxburgh ; in the Parish of Cavers. It is 5\u00a3 m.

DENINO, in the District of St. AndreAv's, and Shire of Fife: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 5 chalders of victual, one half payable in meal, and the other in bear, and \u00a324. in money: the manse was built in 1741 : the glebe consists of a little more than 4f English acres, and a tolerably good garden : Patron, The United College of St. Andre av's : The Church is very small. It is in the Presbytery of St. Andrew's, and Synod of Fife. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (including the District of King's Muir) was 326, and, in 1811, was 294. It is 5 m. N. b. W. from Anstruther. This Parish contains 2280 acres ; of which, about 1000 are arable. It is beautifully intersected by a variety of small streams, which abound with excellent trout. Free-stone, ofa superior quality, is in plenty. The climate is moist and bleak, but not unhealthy. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, an indifferent School honse, and a good garden. DEN MILL, CASTLE, v. ABDIE. DENNISTON, within the Jurisdiction ofthe City of GlasgOAV, and Shire of Lanark : in the Barony Parish. This is a populous Village. It formerly gave the title of Baron, to the family of Denniston, now extinct. DENNY, in the Shire of Stirling : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 80 bolls of meal, and \u00a338.

The Resident Popu-"], [448, "DES lation of this Parish, in 1801, Avas 2033, and, in 1811, was 2654. It is 30 m. W. b. N. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. This Parish is about 4 miles in length, and 2\\ miles in breadth : the soil is, in general, dry aud sandy, and is tolerably fertile, and Avell cultivated. The air is pure, and healthy. The Roads are in good repair. This Parish abounds with good coals, (which are Avorked to a considerable extent at Banknock), and free-stone. Here is a large tract ofland, called Temple Denny, Avhich, it is said, belonged formerly to The Knights' Templars. It is divided from the Parish of Dunipace by the river Carron: And The Grand Canal, between the Forth and Clyde, Avhich runs along the Southern part of the Parish, is of great benefit to the Inhabitants. Two Woollen mills, and tAvo Paper mills, have lately been established here. DENOVAN, v. DUNIPACE. DERBY-HAVEN, in The Isle of Man ; and in the Parish of St. Malew. This is a small Village, which only claims attention from its excellent Harbour. It is 2 m. E. b. N. from Castle-Town. See, Michaels, St., Isle. DERVAL, in the District of Cuninghame, and Shire of Ayr ; in the Parish of Loudon. It is S\\ m. E. from Killmamock. This is a considerable Village. It would seem, that several lands here formerly belonged to The Knights' Templars, as many of them still bear the name of Temple, and do not hold of any Superior, not even of the Crown. Near this is a place, called Glen Chapel, but there is not the least vestige of a Religious edifice. Here are the ruins of an ancient Castle. DESKFORD, in the Shire of Banff : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a344..15..3-/T Sterling of money, 24 bolls 1 firlot of barley, and the same quantity of meal, at 8 stone the boll : the glebe is about 4 acres of arable land, including the garden, with about an acre and a quarter of grass land : the manse, and offices, which have slated roofs, were built about 25 years ago : Patron, The Earl of Seafield, who is also sole Proprietor of the Parish : The Church is gloomy, and miserably furnished. It is in the Presbytery of For dyce, and Synod of Aberdeen. It is 3 m. S. b. E. from Cullen. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 610, and, in 1811, was 628. This Avas originally a part of the Parish of Fordyce, and was included in Cullen, when that Parish was disjoined from Fordyce ; but the precise period when Deskford Avas erected into a separate Parish from Cullen, is not distinctly known. It is about 5 miles in length, and 3 miles at its extreme breadth ; and consists of a Strath or Valley, between a range of hills, open toAvards the North and South ;"], [449, "DEW in the middle ofwhich runs a small river, replenished by many rivulets from'the hills : and their banks are covered with a variety of natural wood. The soil, along the lower parts of the Strath, is generally a rich loam, with a strong clay bottom, producing, in warm seasons, heavy crops of wheat, and other grain : towards the hills, it is a light black mould, on a cold tilly bottom. On the Hill, called Old Moor, is a plentiful supply of excellent Peat, and Turf. At Craibs- town is a Quarry of limestone, which yields lime superior in strength, and colour to any in the neighbourhood, and is consequently in great request. Close to the Church, is an old Castle, called The Tower of Desks ord; and said to have been built by the Sinclairs, who were the immediate predecessors of the Ogilvies, in the property of the Lordship of Deskford. Adjoining to this Tower, there was formerly a Chapel, called St. John's Chapel; upon one ofthe walls of which is an inscription, with the name of Alexander Ogilvie, together with the Arms and Motto of the Ogilvies, and dated 1551. About a mile to the South ofthe Church, stands the Castle of Skuth, but of late years become ruinous: it is delightfully situate on an eminence rising from the burn, having a view ofthe sea, and an extensive prospect ofthe Strath. The Salary ofthe Schoolmaster is \u00a32..1..8. Sterling of money, payable by the Heritor, and about 9 bolls 3 firlots of meal, payable by the Tenants. In the North end ofthe Parish is a Bleachfield, of about 10 acres, which is rented by a manufacturer in Cullen. It is reluctantly to be observed, that the tenants are still bound to perform many Services here. The Roads are in bad repair. It is supposed, that there was a Roman Station in this Parish, from the Roman coins, and the remains of fosse* and roads, that have been discovered; and that it was the Selina of Richard of Cirencester. Deskford gives the title of Baron to the Ancient and Noble Family of Ogilvie, Earl of Findlater. DESKIE, v. INVER-AVON. DEVANA, Statio, of Richard of Cirencester, at Norman-Dikes, on the Dee.

On the March between the Parishes of Heriot and Inver-Lei then, in the Farm of Dewar, there is a Grave, called The Pipes s Grave: he was Piper of Peebles ; and the tradition is, that he engaged for a certain wager, to blow from Peebles to Lauder, at a certain number of blasts ; that he failed in the attempt, died there, and was buried on the spot : the head and foot stones ofthe Grave are visible to this day. On Dewar Hill, not far from this Grave, there i* DESK1E, v. INVER- AVON. vol. i. 3 D"], [450, "D I N a remarkable large stone, called Lot's Wife; but the reason of its title is unknown. At a little distance from hence, is the Wolf Cleuch, of which a traditional story is confidently asserted, that this Cleuch was inhabited by a Wolf, which laid waste the country around, attacking and destroying passengers : a reward was offered, that the man, who killed this ferocious animal, should have these lands ; accordingly, a person had the courage to engage it, and succeeded ; and thence called the lands by his own name, Dewar.

DINGWALL, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Shire of Ross : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of Avhich, in 1811, was \u00a358. in money, 32 bolls of oat-meal, at 9 stones Dutch weight to the boll, and 16 bolls of barley, Country measure, which is considerably larger than the Lin- lithgow: the manse is commodious, and in good condition : the glebe consists of 8 Scotch acres : Patron, The Crown : The Church Avas lately re-built in an ele- gant style. It is in the Presbytery of Dingwall, and Synod of Ross. The Resi- dent Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, vyas 1418, and, in 1811, was 1500. It is 174^ m. N. N. W. from Edinburgh. The Market is well supplied. A General Post-Office is established here. This Town is pleasantly situate at the Western extremity of the Firth of Cromarty, which is navigable for small vessels as far up as the Town: and a constant communication, by sea, is kept up be- tween the Southern and Northern parts ofthe Kingdom. Dingwall, in conjunc- tion Avith the Royal Boroughs of Dornoch, Wick, KirkAvall, and fain, sends one Member to Parliament. It was erected into a Royal Borough by Alexander the Second, in the year 1226; its Privileges were further confirmed by James the Fourth; and by these Charters, it was entitled to all the Privileges, Liber- ties, and Immunities, possessed by the Burgh of Inverness. It is governed by a Provost, two Baillies, a Dean of Guild, a Treasurer, and 10 Counsellors. The County Gaol is established here : and the Town has lately been greatly enlarged, as Avell as improved in the appearance of the houses. The Salary ofthe Paro- chial School is \u00a316., together Avith School-fees, and perquisites, and a good house, and garden. The soil ofthe whole Parish is abundantly fertile, and Avell cultivated : and, it is said, to derive its name from the richness of the lower"], [451, "D I P grounds. It is watered by the river Conan, in which there is a very productive Salmon fishery. The climate is variable, but not unhealthy. At Drynie is a mineral Spring, which is strongly impregnated with sulphur. Game, of various kinds, are in great abundance. Near the shore, are the ruins of the ancient Residence of The Earls of Ross On the forfeiture of Macdonald, Earl of Ross, in 1745, the Proprietor ofthe Estate of Tullochxv&s appointed Hereditary Con stable ofthe Castle, with a Salary of 20 merks, which is still continued to be paid. The Earl of Ross was distinguished among the most powerful of the Scottish Barons, and many of the ancient Families ofthe Shire of Ross hold their Estates by Charters from him, dated \" apud castrum nostrum de Dingwall.\" Near the Church, is an Obelisk, which rises in a pyramidal form to the height of 57 feet: it was erected by George, first Earl of Cromarty, and Secretary of State for Scotland in the reign of Queen Anne ; and was intended to ornament and distinguish this spot, which he designed to be the Family burying- place. Dingwall gave the title of Baron to the family of Preston, attainted in 1715. The Gaelic is still the prevailing language here, and the greater part of Divine Worship is performed in it: but most of the Parishioners now understand, and speak English. An important line of Road has been made from hence to Wester Fearn, on the Dornoch Firth, under the auspices of The Parliamentary Com missioners. DINLABYRE, in the District of Castletown, and Shire of Roxburgh : The Chapel is demolished, but many grave-stones remain near its site. It is situate on the Eastern side of the river Liddal. It now constitutes part of the Parish of Castle-Town. See, Castle- Town. DINWOODIE, in the Shire of Dumfries : formerly a Chapelry, now com prehended in the Parish of Applegarth. At Dinwoodie Green is the Stage, where the Mail-coach, from London to Glasgow, stops and changes horses. This stage is only 5 miles distant from the village of Lockerby, where there is a Post-Office, 11 miles from Eccles-Fechan, and 11 from Moffat, which are also Stages, and have Post-Offices. Through the latter village, a Diligence passes from Dumfries to Edinburgh, three times a week, which renders travelling from this part of the country, to Edinburgh and Glasgow, very easy and convenient. The Parish of Applegarth is distant from Edinburgh about 60 miles, and nearly an equal distance from Glasgow. See, Applegarth. DIPPEN, v. KILL-MORY. DIPPLE, in the Shire of Elgin : an ancient Rectory, now comprehended in 3D2"], [452, "D I R the Parish of Speyinouth. It is 1-f- m, W. from Fochabers. Here is a mortifi cation of \u00a3666..13..4. to the Poor; and of \u00a3333.. 6.. 8. to the School, together with tAvo bolls of meal annually, by the late William Duff, Esq. The Church, which is noAv demolished, was dedicated to The Holy Ghost ; but the Church yard is still in use. There is also a mortification to the Poor of this Parish by William Ego, in Beathill. At the Style of the Church-yard, there formerly stood a small House, commonly called \" The House ofthe Holy Ghost;\" around which, following the course of the sun, the people usually made a Tour with the Corpse at burials, and could not be restrained from this superstition, until the walls of it were quite destroyed. The Parson of Dipple was Titular of Rathven, in the District of Strath-Bogie. DIRLET, CASTLE, v. HALKIRK. DIRLTON, in the Shire of Hadington : a Chapelry, anciently appendant to the Vicarage of Golyn : the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3216., together with a manse, and glebe : Patron, William Nisbet, Esq. : The old Church stood at the Village of Golyn, till the year 1612, when it was removed to Dirlton by Act of Parliament, and thus gave its name to the Parish. It is in the Presbytery of Hadington, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 1115, and, in 1811, was 1211. It is 2|m. W. S.W. from North Berwick. This Parish is nearly six miles square : The Western part, which lies along the Firth of Forth, is sandy, and barren for nearly three miles ; towards the East, the soil becomes better, being a fine level plain ; and, in the Southern part, it is particularly rich and fertile : agriculture is much improved here, and inclosures are becoming general. There are several Villages in the Parish {viz. Congalton, Fenton, Kingston, and Golyn), where old and infirm persons keep Schools for young children ; but the principal established School, is in the Village of Dirlton, Avhich is nearly in the centre of the Parish, built upon a rocky ground, rising as it recedes from the sea : the Salary is 300 merks Scotch ; and there is a mortification of \u00a370., by Mrs. Carmichael, for educating and providing books for poor children. Coal is the common fuel, either brought by sea, or from some coal-pits which are now wrought in the County. Agues, and nervous complaints, are common here. Near the Head land, called Golyn-Ness, there was formerly a Ferry-boat, for carrying Passen gers from East- Lothian to Fife. The founder of the Castle of Dirlton, and the time of its erection, are both unknown : It is mentioned in history, as early as the year 1298 : It then belonged to one of the Baronial Family of de Vallibus, or"], [453, "DOL de Vaux : and when King Edward the First invaded Scotland by the Eastern borders, surrendered to Anthony Beck, Bishop of Durham, after a very obstinate defence. During the Civil wars, in 1650, it was taken by General Lambert, after a severe struggle, and by him reduced to its present ruinous state. In 1440, Sir Walter Halyburton, Lord High Treasurer of Scotland, was created a Peer by the title of Lord Dirlton : and, in 1444, he founded a Collegiate Church here. About the beginning of the Seventeenth Century, this Lordship belonged to Sir James Maxwell, a zealous Royalist, who was, by King Charles . the First, created Lord Dirlton : he ruined his estate by his attachment to the Royal Cause ; and, soon after the Restoration, it came into the possession of Sir John Nisbet, King's Advocate : it is now the property of William Nisbet, Esq., his descendant, who has a handsome Seat near it. Mr. Grose has preserved a view ofthis Castle. The title of Lord Dirlton is now extinct. See, Golyn, and Fenton. DIRRINGTON LAWS, v. LONGFOR-MACUS. DIURNES, v. DURNESS.

DOLLAR, in the Shire of Clackmannan : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, Avas\u00a3150. : the manse is in bad repair: the glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Patron, The Duke of Argyle, who is also Superior, and Titular of the Tythes : The Church Avas re-built in 1775, and is very neat. It is in the Presbytery of Stirling, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resi dent Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, Avas 693, and, in 1811, was 743. It is 12 m. W. S. W. from Kinross. The middle and principal part of the Parish, in which both the Church and the Village stand, is an extensive and gently sloping plain, beautifully interspersed with small villages, farm-houses, and inclosures ; and, taking in with it a small part of Muckart on the East, and Tillicoultry on the West, forms a kind of amphitheatre, of about three miles in length, and one mile in breadth ; being bounded by the Ochil Hills on the North, and a rising ground on the South. At the foot ofthe Hills, and the greater part ofthe Plain, the soil is light and gravelly, and very productive : on the banks ofthe Dovan, or Devon, a beautiful stream which nearly divides the Parish into two equal parts, the ground is chiefly haugh, with an intermixture of clay. The air is"], [454, "DOL remarkably pure, and healthy. Here are three coal Avorks, belonging to The Duke of Abgyle, and Lord Alva. On the banks ofthe Dovan is a fine Bleach field, established, in 1787, by Mr. William Haigh, and which is in a flourishing state. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with the Interest of 560 merks Scotch, of mortified money, and perquisites. The greatest part of the Parish of Dollar Avas formerly the property of the Ancient and Illustrious House of Argyle, who have possessed the Barony, and the lands belonging to it, called The Lordship of Campbell, so far back as the year 1465: but, in 1605, it was feued out by Archibald Earl of Argyle, and Dame Agnes Douglas, his Countess, reserving only Castle Campbell, and two farms in the neighbourhood. From a bridge over a small brook, that runs through the village, is a fine view ofthe ruins of Castle Campbell, situate on the top of a circular mound, which seems to have been partly formed by the hand of nature, and partly finished by art. On each side is a ravine, or glen, down which run streams that unite immediately below the Castle, and form a considerable brook. The mound upon which the Castle stands, is nearly perpendicular on the side next Dollar, and was formerly disjoined from the surrounding hills by a ditch, shelving doAvn to the bottom ofthe Glen on each side, which rendered the Castle inaccessible, except by means ofa draAvbridge ; so that it Avas formerly a place of very great strength. Though the Castle stands upon an eminence, it is surrounded on all sides by higher hills, many of Avhich are wooded to their sum mits, which gives to the whole scenery a Very picturesque effect. It is not known when or by whom this venerable pile of building was erected. It was formerly called The Castle of Gloom, a name very expressive of its situation : it is bounded by the Glens of Care, and washed by the Burns of Sorrow, for so the Celtic names ofthe glens and brooks are said to signify : but when it came into the possession of the Noble family of Argyle, whose property it still is, it was called Castle Campbell, by which name it has ever since been known. This Castle, with the whole territory belonging to the family of Argyle, suffered by the calamities of Civil war in 1645: for The Marquis of Montrose, the enemy and rival of the House of Argyle, carried fire and sword through the whole estate. During this commotion, the Castle was destroyed, and its mag nificent ruins only remain, a sad monument of the horrors of the times. Not only the Castle, but the whole of the Parishes, both of Dollar, and Muckart were burned (the inhabitants being vassals of the family of Argyle) excepting one house, which the followers of Montrose supposed to belong to the Abbey of"], [455, "DOL Dunfermlin. Mr. Grose has preserved two views of it. From The White Wisp is a very rich, and extensive prospect. One feu, of nearly 254 English acres, is holden by being- obliged to slaughter all the cattle that may be Avanted for the use ofthe familyof Argyle, in the place of Castle Campbell. DOLLAR-BURN, v. MANOR. DOLPHINGTON, in the Upper Ward, and Shire of Lanark : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a338..17..9_f in money, \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements, and \u00a3111.. 2.. 2\u00a7 by Parliamentary augmentation : the manse Avas built in 1770: the glebe contains about 8 acres; Patron, Lord Douglas : The Church is in decent condition. It is in the Presbytery of Biggar, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801 , was 231, and, in 1811, was 268. It is 4| m. S. W. from Linton. This Parish is about 3 miles in length, and 2~ miles in breadth ; the great Road from Edinburgh to Leadhills, by Biggar, passing through it. The soil is for the most part a light black mould, on a close red clay, and tilly bottom, which makes generally very Avet, and the harvest late ; which is rendered further precarious, by the early frosts in August and September. A good dwelling-house has been built upon 4 acres of land, bequeathed by William Brown, Esq., in 1650, for the benefit ofthe School- master; who has also the interest of 1000 merks Scotch, mortified by the same benevolent Gentleman, for educating poor Scholars : the Master has likewise 100 merks for teaching 20 poor Scholars, being part ofthe rent of a Farm lying in the Parish of Dunsyre, bequeathed, for charitable pur- poses, by The Rev. John Bowie, Minister of this Parish, in 1759. On the summit of one of the hills, are the remains of an encampment, which incloses about 4 acres of ground. And, upon another Hill, called The Kip, is a large heap of stones, on which fires are supposed to have been kindled, to warn the country of invasion, or predatory incursions. x DOLPHIN STON, in the Shire of Hadington ; and in the Parish of Preston Pans. It is 2 m. W. from Tranent. Here are the ruins ofa family Seat of The Earl of Hyndford, who is Proprietor of the lands of Dolphinston and Dolphins ton Mains. See, Preston Pans. DOLPHISTON, in the District of Jedburgh, and Shire of Roxburgh ; in; the Parish of Oxnam. It is a small Village, situate on the banks of the river Jed, at the distance of 5\\ miles S. S. E. from Jedburgh. Here is an ancient Tower, which is said to have been built by one Dolphus, from whom it took its name. The walls are from 8 to 10 feet thick, built of hewn stone, and so closely"], [456, "DOR cemented with lime, that it is found more difficult to obtain stones from it for building, than from a quarry. It has been extensive, and divided into small apartments by stone partitions. Several vaulted apertures are in the middle of the walls, large enough for a small bed, and some of them so long, as to be used by the tenants for holding their ladders. On a rising ground, a little to the South there is an area of a chain square, Avhich is said to have been a Watch ToAver or Light-House, and seems to imply that Dolphiston ToAver had been used as a Fort, or place of Refuge. DONAN, CASTLE, v. KINTAIL. DORARY, in the Shire of Caithness, though locally situate in the Shire of Sutherland : it belongs to the Parish of Thurso, although it is not Avithin four miles of any part of that Parish. This hill is of considerable height, and about its base is a good deal of arable ground, which yields good crops of corn, a pro digious quantity of natural hay, and affords excellent pasture for a great number of cattle: it is, therefore, esteemed the best Highland farm in the country. It is a part of the Bishop's lands, was a Shieling belonging to the Bishops of this Coimty, and from this circumstance it derives its name : the walls of the old Chapel, called Gavin's Kirk or Temple Gavin, are still standing. The view from its summit is very grand, and extensive. DORE HOLM, one of the Shetland Isles ; and constituting part of the Parish of North-Maven. It is situate in a spacious Bay to the Southward, and derives its name from a remarkable arch which passes through its centre ; it is lofty and capacious, and admits the boatmen to fish under it, being lighted by an opening at the top. DORES, in the Shire of Inverness : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a340. Sterling, and 3 chalders of victual, half bear, half meal ; together with a manse, and a glebe of exactly 4 acres : Patron, Lord Cawdor : The Church is situate on the North-East bank of Loch Ness. It is in the Pres bytery of Inverness, and Synod of Moray. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 1365, and, in 1811, was 1314. It is 9 m. S. S. W. from Inverness. This Parish is about 20 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth. The surface is mountainous, having a narrow valley running nearly the whole extent of the Parish : the soil is in general light, but not much cultivated ; the greater part being fit only for sheep pasture. The air is salubrious. At Gortuleg, the late James Fraser, Esq., Writer to the Signet, introduced the new system of agri culture, and spared no pains nor expense to improve his property there ; his"], [457, "DOR Tenants have also good leases, and his patriotic example, in both these respects, is highly deserving of imitation. The roads are in good repair. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks. Here are several extensive Fir Plantations, which are in a thriving condition. At the distance of three miles from Loch Ness, are the vestiges of a Fort, called Castel Dun-Richuan, or The Castle of the King ofthe Ocean, a name which it is supposed to have received, at the period when the King of Norway and Denmark was master ofthe sea. A little to the East ofthis Fort, there are several Cairns, and one almost equal in size to all the rest : tradition says, that Fingal, so much celebrated in Ossian's Poems, here engaged in battle Ashi, the son ofthe Norwegian King, and killed him, which gave the name of Drum- Ashi, or Ashi's Hill, to the scene where this event happened. About 9 miles distant, there is another Fort, called Dun- Dardell, which is said to have been one of the many Forts in The great Valley, extending from the German Ocean at Inverness, to the Atlantic at Fort William, that were intended for making signals, by fire, ofthe enemy's approach, during the times of the Danish and Norwegian incursions. The rocky ground, under this fort, is particularly grand. DORLIN, FERRY, v. MORVERN. DORNIE, v. KINTAIL. DORNOCH, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Shire of Sutherland : formerly a Cathedral Church, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 80 bolls of bear, and 700 merks Scotch, including Communion elements : the manse is in bad repair : the glebe is considerably under the legal standard : Patron, The Countess of Sutherland : Three aisles of the ancient Cathedral form the present Church, the fourth aisle having been long in ruins : most ofthe families of any distinction, connected with the Parish, continue to bury within the Church : around the Cathedral is the Church-yard, without any fence, and in the centre of the Burgh ; it is the Market place, and the County Road runs through it. It is in the Presbytery of Dornoch, and Synod of Suther land and Caithness. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 2362, and, in 1811, was 2681. It is 210 m. N.'b. W. from Edinburgh. The Fairs are holden on the first Wednesday in February, third Wednesday in March, the first Wednesday and 22d., O. S., in July, or first Wednesday aster, and the first Wednesdays in November, and December. It was erected into a Royal Borough, by a Charter from Charles the First, in 1628 ; and is governed by a Provost, 4 Baillies, a Dean of Guild, a Treasurer, and 8 Counsellors, four. vol. i. 3 E"], [458, "DOR of whom are annually changed. Dornoch, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of DingAvall, Kirkwall, Tain, and Wick, sends one Member to Parliament. It has no landed property, nor any other source of Revenue besides the Customs that are levied at the Fairs, and which are on the decline, as indeed the place itself is in the last stage of decay. It is the County ToAvn, and the residence of the Sheriff- Substitute, Sheriff-Clerk, and a Messenger. A General Post-Office is established here. It is the Presbytery Seat, and is also that of the Synod, alternately with Thurso in the Shire of Caithness. At the shore of Dornoch, small vessels lie in safety, with tolerable weather ; but a formidable bar stretches from the Eastern point ofthe coast of Dornoch, almost quite over to the South side of the Firth, called The Gizzing Briggs, from their incessant noise : the banks forming this bar are not, however, so closely connected, but that vessels of about 300 tons burden may enter, under the direction of a Pilot. The air is pure, and salubrious, if we except the immediate vicinity ofa large morass, ex tending from the Town of Dornoch upwards of two miles to the Westward, and lying along the County Road : this has been a Common ; and, some years ago, a scheme of division was formed, under the authority of the Court of Session : it was accordingly divided among the Proprietors ofthe adjacent lands, and march stones set up ; but still it lies undrained, and a nuisance, as before : some feeble attempts have been made towards culture at the Western extremity of it. This was formerly the Seat of the Bishop of Caithness, the precise time of the erection of which See is not known; but it must have existed before the year 1150, as we find Andrew, Bishop of Caithness, a Avitness to a donation by David the First to the Abbey of Dunfermlin in that year : The Bishop lodged in the Castle ; the Dean's house is at present the Inn. There was also a Monastery for Red Friars or Mathurines here, which was founded by Sir Patrick Murray, in 1271 ; but the very site of it is now unknown : after the Town of Berwick had fallen into the hands of the English, the lands belonging to that Ministry Avere given to this place. There are also the ruins of the ancient Castle, which appears to have been a stately and sumptuous edifice. The Parish of Dornoch extends 9 miles from East to West along the coast of the Firth of Dornoch, and from South to North or North-West, about 15 measured miles. The shores are flat and sandy, and the lands contiguous to them generally level ; but are gradually elevated as they approach the hilly districts to the North, where the soil par takes of moss. The coast abounds with fish ; and the river Evelicks, which falls into the sea near the Meikle Ferry, affords a few salmon, and trout. In the"], [459, "DOR hilly part ofthe Parish, are three or four Lakes ; the largest of them being about a mile long, and a quarter of a mile broad, and produces a fine red trout of a delicious flavour. There is no natural wood of any value, nor are the Plantations Of great extent. A considerable quantity of Moss Fir is found in the morasses, which serves for candles to the poorer people ; and logs are sometimes dug up, that are sufficiently large for building. The Countess of Sutherland is the principal Proprietor. The Gaelic is the prevalent language. Here is a Parochial School. The Firth of Dornoch, sometimes called The Firth of Tain, is that arm ofthe Sea which divides the Southern parts ofthe Shire of Sutherland from the Shire of Ross. The entrance of this Firth is nearly 15 miles Avide, and gradually becomes narrower, till about 3 miles West from the Town of Dornoch, where its breadth is not above two measured miles, and where there is a Ferry-boat, called The Meikle Ferry; on each side, there is \"a large Boat for transporting carriages, horses, and other cattle across ; as also a yawl for the accommodation of foot passengers : but, on crossing at this Ferry, on the 16th of August 1809, 147 persons had the sad misfortune to be drowned. At The Little Ferry, which is situate to the Northward, across Loch Fleet, there is also a Ferry, with suitable accommodations. This Loch runs about 4 miles up the country, and affords an excellent Harbour, where Ships of 500 tons burden may enter at high water, and lie in perfect safety, after having got over a bar that runs across the entrance. In the centre of the Parish of Rogart, is a District belonging to Dornoch, which, in 1791, contained 113 Persons. The Shire of Sutherland, according to Mr. Nimmo, was originally a part of the \" Sheriffdome,\" of Inverness, and of the Diocese of Caithness. It was included in the Shire of Caithness at the first proposal for erecting that Shire in the Act of James ; how far that Act may have taken effect, it is difficult now to ascertain, but the probability is, that it soon fell into oblivion, for we find no notice taken ofthe new County of Caithness, in the subsequent Acts of Parliament. Sutherland, however, had been early a Comitatus or Earldom ; the Earls of Sutherland being confessedly among the most ancient in Europe. But their Jurisdiction, probably, extended only over Sutherland Proper, or The District between the Firth and the Mountains. The present name was given to this Shire by the Danes ; it formed the Southern part of their Dominions, Avhich, according to Snorro, and Torf\u00e6us, extended to Eckiels Bacca, i. e. The Banks ofthe Oikel. It would appear that the Crown, on the forfeiture of Harold Earl of Caithness, divided the Estate, and gave the 3E2"], [460, "DOR Southern part of Caithness, i. e. Sutherland, to William Freskyn, Sheriff of Inverness in 1204, first Earl of Sutherland, Avho thereafter assumed the name of Sutherland, and the Heir Female carried the honours to her husband. Adam de Gordon, Son to the Earl of HuntleY, and the Family, have since resumed the name of Sutherland ; and the honours and great estates are now vested in Elizabeth Sutherland, Countess of Sutherland, Baroness of Strathnaver, and Premier Countess of Scotland; Her Ladyship was married on the 4th of September 1785, to George, Marquis of Stafford. Upon a plain, not far from the sea, is a small Cross, called Tlie Thane's, erected in memory of the battle of Embo, in 1259, between William Earl of Sutherland and the Danes, who were there overthrown, and their General slain : and not far from thence is the spot where an unhappy creature Avas burned in 1727, for the imaginary crime of witch-craft, being the last instance of these frantic executions in the North of Scotland : as that, in the South, was at Paisley, in 1697. An important line of road, from Dingwall to Wester Fearn (altered from Easter Fearn) on the Dornoch Firth, a distance of 24f miles, has been made under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commissioners. See, Inverness, and Burgh-Head. DORNOCK, in the Shire of Dumfries : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : the manse Avas re-built in 1778: the glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Patron, The Marquis of Queensberry : The Church is small, and inconvenient. It is in the Presbytery of Annan, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 691, and, in 1811, was 788. It is 2\\ m. E. b. S. from Annan. The Fair is holden on the first Wednesday, or Wednesday aster, in November. This Parish is nearly a square of two miles and a half, all extending along the shore of the Solway Firth ; except a small detached part, consisting of three Farms, which lie along the banks of the Kirtle. The surface is remarkably flat ; and the soil is, in general, fertile, when properly cultivated. The air is healthy, though rather moist and chilly. The Solway Firth is navigable, at high water, for vessels of 100 tons burden, five or six miles to the Eastward of this Village ; and vessels may lie in safety any where along the shore, being all flat sand, without rocks. The tides are pretty regular : Spring-tides rise about 25 feet above low-water mark, and ordinary tides about 10 or 12: there are evident marks of the tides having been higher, at some distant period, upon this coast than they are at pre sent, by at least 20 feet. The fishings in the Firth are very productive. Here are some good Quarries of red free-stone, and also of muir or whinstone. Fuel"], [461, "D O U is expensive. The great road, from Carlisle to Port-Patrick, runs through the middle of the Parish. A battle is said to have been fought upon a muir in the neighbourhood, betAveen a party ofthe English, commanded by Sir Marmaduke Langdale and Lord Crosby, and a body of Scots, commanded by Sir William Brown, of Coalston ; in which the English were defeated, and both their Com manders slain ; their graves are still shown in this Church-yard ; and a Spring on the muir, where the battle was fought, still bears the name of The Sword Well, probably from some warlike weapons having been found there after the engagement. At Stableton, now the property ofthe Family of Annandale, is a strong square Tower, with battlements on the top, which is said to have been built by a gentleman of the name of Irvine, and was evidently designed for a place of safety against the depredations of the English Borderers. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, which is paid by the Heritors ; together with a School-house, and the usual School-fees. More provisions are raised in the Parish, than are equal to its consumption ; and a considerable quantity of oats, and barley, are exported. DQUGLAS, in the Upper Ward, and Shire of Lanark : formerly a Rectory, and Prebend, the Stipend of which, before it was augmented, was \u00a383.. 6.. 8. Sterling: the glebe consists of 35 acres : Patron, Lord Douglas *. The Church, manse, and offices, were rebuilt in 1781 : The old Church was called St. Bride's, in honour of the Patroness of the Parish; and a part of it is still kept up, on account ofthe ancient monuments and burying vault in it, although there is a very elegant vault in the new Church, for the family of Douglas, in which are deposited the remains of The Duke and Duchess of Douglas, and Lady Lucy Douglas. It is in the Presbytery of Lanark, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population ofthis ToAvn, and Parish, in 1801, was 1730, and, in 1811, was 1873. It is 40{ m. S W. b. S. from Edinburgh. A General Post- Office is established here. Itis situate on the Eastern bank of the river Douglas, and is the centre of the great roads from Glasgow to England, and from Edin burgh to Ayr. Besides the public School, there is also an English school in the Town ; and two or three in the Country district. The Parish of Douglas is about 12 miles in length, and from 4 to 7 in breadth. Along the banks of the river, the soil is tolerably good ; but the principal part is hilly, and appropriated to the pasturage of sheep. From its elevated situation, the air is very moist, parti cularly in the Spring and Autumn ; when the wind from the South-West generally blows with great impetuosity. Considerable plantations have lately"], [462, "D O U been made here, and are in a thriving condition. Coals, lime-stone, and free stone, are in great plenty. The roads are in tolerable repair. Douglas gives the title of Baron to the Ancient and Illustrious family of Douglas, the Dukedom being extinct. According to Mr. Pennant, Douglas-Dale is a fertile valley, distinguished by the residence ofthe family of Douglas, a race of turbu lent heroes, celebrated throughout Europe for deeds of arms, \u2014 the glory, yet the scourge of their country, \u2014 the terror of their Princes, \u2014 the pride ofthe Northern annals of chivalry. They derive their name from Sholto Du Glasse, i. e. The Black and Grey Warrior, a hero in the reign of Solvathius, King of Scotland, who lived about the year 767. But the family of Douglas first began to rise into power in the days of the good Sir James, who died in 1330. During a Century and a half, their greatness knew no bounds, and their arrogance was equally unlimited ; that high spirit, which was wont to be exerted against the enemies of their country, now degenerated into faction, sedition, and treason : they emulated the Royal authority, \u2014 they went abroad with a train of two thou sand armed men, \u2014 created Knights, had their Counsellors, established Ranks, and constituted a Parliament; and, it is certain, that they might almost have formed a House of Peers out of their own family, for, at the same time, there were not fewer than Six Earls of the name of Douglas. Douglas Castle, the residence of these Reguli, seems to have been prostrated almost as frequently as its masters : the ruin that is seen there at present, is the remains ofthe last old Castle (which was burned by accident), for many have been built upon the same site. The present Castle is an imperfect Pile, begun by the late Duke : tbe windows are Gothic : and the apartments are fitted up with great elegance, \" which show that the storms of ambition have been laid, and that a long calm of ease and content is intended to succeed.\" Near the Castle, are several very ancient Ash trees, whose branches groaned under the weight of executions, when the family knew no law but its will. Douglas-Dale was formerly almost entirely the property of The Dukes of Douglas ; and Lord Douglas, the Representa tive of that powerful family, is still the principal Proprietor. DOUGLAS, in The Isle of Man ; and in the Parish of Kirk Braddan : The Chapel is dedicated to St. Matthew. The Resident Population ofthis Town, in 1811, was from five to six Thousand persons. It is said to derive its name from the junction of the two rivers Duff and Glass, a little above the Town, and which afterwards unite with Douglas Bay. Many of the Houses are good : but the Streets are very irregular, and, in some parts, extremely narrow. The Market"], [463, "D O U Is well supplied. The Seat of Government is at Castle-Town, about 10 miles distant: but trade and commerce have rendered Douglas, in Avealth and import ance, greatly superior. The situation is both salubrious, and pleasant; com manding a fine view of the neighbouring country, and a most extensive prospect ofthe sea, Avith the majestic mountains of Lancashire and Cumberland. The sea-bathing is particularly safe and delightful here. The Pier, which is 520 feet in length, and 40 feet in breadth, was constructed under the direction of Mr. Stewart ; upon it, is a handsome, and very useful Light-House ; and being well paved with flag-stones, affords an excellent promenade, and, in fine wea ther, is crowded with genteel company. The Bay is nearly two miles across ; it has good anchorage, except on the Northern side, and is sheltered from all winds but the East. Both points of the Bay are rocky and dangerous ; and, in the middle, is a large bed of rocks, which is just covered at high water. The Harbour is esteemed the best dry one in the Irish Channel, and admits vessels of considerable burden to approach at high water close to the Quay, the depth at spring tides being from 15 to 20 feet. Here is an Assembly every three or four weeks ; the Theatre is relinquished. There is a Free-School: and a public Circulating Library, and Reading-Room, have lately been established. All Letters for The Isle of Man are brought from Whitehaven to Douglas by a Packet, which ought to leave that Port every Monday night ; but which, owing to bad weather and the difficulty of getting out of the Harbour, is sometimes delayed for two or three weeks in the winter season. It remains three days at Douglas, and then returns. The Letters are sorted from the Post-Office ; and those for Castle-Town, Peel, and Ramsay, are fonvarded in the order of their names. The Letter-carrier stops one day at Ramsay, and then returns by the same route with the Letters for England. Every person expecting Letters applies for them at the Post-Office. Upon an eminence, a little to the Westward ofthe Town, is St. George's Chapel ; a modern edifice, at once spacious and elegant. It was built by subscription, and the funds were lodged with The Right Reverend George Mason, Bishop of the Diocese ; a man, whose elevation to the Epis copal Dignity occasioned his future misfortunes ; and, at whose death, there was a great deficiency of the Funds which had been entrusted to his care. This is the principal residence of the English. The late Mansion of The Duke of Athol is a fine edifice : It was built, previous to the sale of the Island, by a Merchant in Douglas, at a considerable expense ; and was soon after that transaction sold to His Grace for \u00a3300. : a memorable instance of the consternation, and narrow"], [464, "D O U views, which universally prevailed in the Island at that period : it is now occu pied by Mr. Scott, His Grace's Agent. Mona Castle, about half a mile North from the Town, is a stately modern building, erected by the present Duke of Athol, and is intended for Iris future residence. The Cistertian Abbey here was removed to Rushen. At a little distance from Douglas is situate, in a most de lightful solitude, The Nunnery; which, according to the Manks' tradition, was founded in the Sixth century, by St. Bridget, when she came to receive the veil of Virginity from St. Maughold. The Prioress was anciently a Baroness of The Isle : her person was sacred, and her revenue extensive. She held Courts in her own name ; and from the Lord's Court she frequently demanded her vassals, and tried them by a Jury of her OAvn tenants. But every vestige of her magnifi cence and dignity has long since vanished, except the ruins of the Convent where she once presided, and which, being shaded Avith aged trees, are at once gloomy and romantic. Close to the ruins, is a modern building, erected by Major Taubman, the worthy Proprietor, and which has a superior air of elegance : the gardens are spacious, and luxuriant ; and this charming retirement, once conse crated to piety, is now sacred to hospitality and unbounded benevolence. The land around Douglas, though perhaps not the richest, is certainly the best cul tivated in The Island. A weekly NeAvspaper is printed and published here. DOUGLAS-DALE, v. DOUGLAS. DOUN ANS, v. KILL-MODAN. DOUNE, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Killmadock, the Church of which is situate here. It is 44 m. NW. b. W. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. The Markets are well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the 11th of February, the second Wednesday in May, the 26th of July, the 2d and 26th of November, and the 26th of December. This Town is pleasantly situate near the confluence of the rivers Ardoch, and Teith. The great roads from Edinburgh to Fort William, and from Glasgow to Perth, cross each other here. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, toge ther with School-fees, and perquisites, and a free house, and garden. There are several other private Schools in the Parish : and, at the Western extremity, near Callander, The Society for propagating Christian KnoAA'ledge have established one, Avith a Salary of \u00a310. ; to which Mr. Buchannan, of Cambusmore, has very liberally presented the master with a free house, school-house, and garden. Anciently the administration of Justice was committed to the Steward of Monteith, and his Deputies, who held Courts in Doune : But, in 1748, this"], [465, "D O W Heritable Jurisdiction Avas annexed to the Crown, and Avas valued at \u00a31200. Sterling. Since that period, the Sheriff ofthe County of Perth has holden Courts for this District at Dunblane : And the Commissary of Dunblane has likewise a Jurisdiction over this Parish. This Town has long been noted for excellent Slaters, and the manufacture of Highland Pistols. The Castle of Doune, according to tradition, was built by Murdoch, Duke of Albany, and Earl of Monteith and Fife, Avho, it is said, was executed on an adjacent hill. It is very pleasantly and strongly situate, being almost surrounded by the river Teith. About the year 1528, Sir James Steavart, of Beith, was appointed Constable of it by James the Fifth: Avhose son, in 1565, obtained a Charter under the Great Seal of cer tain lands, to be called The Barony of Doune. He was a steady friend to Queen Mary during the Civil wars, when this Castle was always a safe retreat to the Loyalists. In the Commotions of 1745, it Avas for some time occupied by the Rebels; and, on its being quitted by them, an engineer Avas sent down by Go vernment to sunTey the Castle, with an intent to repair and fortify it, if capable of being made tenable ; but it is probable, that he reported to the contrary. It has since been neglected and suffered to fall to ruin : and is at present the pro perty of The Earl of Moray. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. Doune gives the title of Viscount to the Ancient and Illustrious Family of Stuart, Earl of Moray. DOUNIES, in the Shire of Kincardine ; and in the Parisii of Banchory Da vinick. It is 8 m. S. from Aberdeen. This is a small Fishing village, on the German Ocean. DOWALLY, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Chapelry, annexed to the Parish of Dunkeld; the Minister of which preaches here one diet in the after noon of every second Sabbath ; and on the forenoon of these days he preaches at Dunkeld, and afterwards at Dowally : The Church, Avhich was built by Bishop Brown, in the year 1500, is a long, narrow, inelegant structure, and very incom modiously seated. It is in the Presbytery of Dunkeld, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 672, and, in 1811, was 533. It is 5 m. N. b. W. from Dunkeld. This Parish was originally a part ofthe Parish of Caputh, and though it is now considered as united to Dunkeld, there is no evidence existing of any formal annexation having taken place. It has a Session, a Session-Clerk, and Register, separate from those of Dunkeld, and the Poor's Funds are kept distinct from those of the other. This Parish contains about 11,580 acres, stretching along the Eastern bank ofthe river Tay: vol. i. 3 F"], [466, "D R A At the upper extremity, the Barony of Dalcapon, Avhich extends along the North bank of the Tummel for three quarters of a mile, is separated from it by an intervening part of the Parish of Logie-Rait. The soil on the hills is very shal- Ioav, but affords pasture to numerous flocks of sheep; and many of them are covered Avith natural forests, that are well stocked with red and roe deer, and game of various kinds. The soil of the haughs is light and sandy, but abun- dantly fertile ; and agriculture has of late been much improved here, by the liberal encouragement of The Duke of Athol, who is sole Proprietor of the Parish. Fuel is expensive. Except the Barony of Dalcapon, all the lands are thirled to the mill of Dowally : the multure being 6 lippies of sheeling for the boll, and one lippie to the miller. Loch Ordie abounds with trout, and eels, and is a favourite resort of anglers from Dunkeld. The rocky hills of Craigy Barns, and King's Seat, rise on the lower boundary of Dowally, presenting a very pre cipitous and picturesque appearance towards the East : the latter deriving its name, from the circumstance of its having been the place where the Scottish Monarchs placed themselves, in order to direct their shafts with advantage at the flying deer, AA'hen driven that way for their amusement: and, according to a story told by William Barclay in his treatise contra Monarchomachos, a chase of this kind had very nearly prevented the future miseries of the unhappy Mary Stuart. The road, which passes through Dowally to Athol, has been cut with great labour and expense along the bottom of Tlie King's Seat; which over hangs the river so closely, and at such a height, that the timid traveller, who looks over the wall that has been built to support it, is disposed to hasten on his way; but, a range of tall and thick trees, while they conceal the terrors ofthe scene, add at the same time to its singular beauty. The Gaelic language is commonly spoken here ; though all the Inhabitants, at the same time, under stand the English more or less perfectly : and itis curious, that the hills of King's Seat and Craigy Barns, have been for centuries the separating barrier of these languages : in the first house below them, the English language is, and has been long spoken ; while the Gaelic invariably prevails in the first house above them, and at not more than a mile distant.

The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 1057, and, in 1811, was 911. It is 6 m. N. from Elgin. This Parish is a Peninsula, stretching East and West along the Moray Firth, about tAvo measured miles in its greatest breadth, and four miles in its greatest length : in general, it is Ioav and flat: scarcely one half of the surface is arable, the greatest part consisting of barren moor-ground, covered with short heath, or coarse benty grass. The land under cultiA'ation is fertile ; part of it being a rich loam or clay, and part of it a light black, or sandy soil. The Salary of the Parochial Schoolmaster is 300 merks, and a rood of land, to which is conjoined the office of Session-clerk about \u00a33. Sterling, and a few trifling perquisites. The climate is, in general, mild, and wholesome. The only language spoken here is the Scottish. The Roads are all made by Statute labour, and are in tolerable condition. There is only one Bridge in the Parish, which consists of three arches, over the outlet from- the Loch of Spynie ; but others are much wanted over the river Lossie. The Loch of Spynie is a beautiful piece of fresh water, about three miles long, and one mile broad, which discharges itself into the river Lossie, about a mile from the Moray Firth : it abounds Avith eels, and pike, and aquatic birds of various kinds: at some former period, it appears evidently to have formed a Bay ofthe sea, and to have been connected with another Loch in the Parish of Urquhart, called Cotts, which is only half a mile distant. Drainy was once the property of the ancient Family of Innes, now extinct ; and from whom it was purchased by Sir Robert Gordon, Bart., in 1636.

The present Parish of Drummelzier is composed of the old District of Lower Drummelzier, and of the Southern half ofthe old Parish of Dawick, which was annexed to it, in 1742. This Parish is about three miles in breadth, and extends twelve miles in length, chiefly on the banks of the Tweed. The surface is beautifully varied with hills, and plains: and the soil is of a fertile sandy loam. The air is healthy. At Palmood is a small Wood of natnral trees ; and several Plantations were laid out some years ago, by the late Sh* James Nasmyth, which are in a flourishing condition. At Kingle-Doors, in the upper part of this Parish, there was formerly a Chapel, dedicated to St. Cuthbert, the early Evangelist of Tweedside. During the reign of Alexander the Third, Symon Fraser, the father, who died in 1291, granted to the Monks of Melros the lands of South Kingle Doors, with the Chapel of St. Cuthbert, and the lands of Hopcar \u2022 Shire. The Castle of Drummelzier is situate close to the river Tweed. It was formerly the Seat ofthe poAverful Family of Tweedie, who had great possessions in the South of Scotland. A small Castle, situate on the point of a steep conical rock, about half a mile from Drummelzier, was used by the Lords of Tweedie, as a sort of redoubt or citadel.

The Church and manse being situate on a haugh, or dale, by the side of the river Dee, and near to a Well, which is still called St. Maik's Well, has probably given rise to the name of Dalmaik.

It is in the Presbytery of Lochmaben, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (including the flourishing Town of Lockerby) was 1607, and, in 1811, was 1893. It is adjacent to Lockerby, on the North-West. This Parish is about 7 miles in length, and from one to six miles in breadth. The Western, and Southern parts are generally flat, and cultivated : the Upper, or Northern parts, are hilly, and mostly in pasture. It is watered by the rivers Annan, Dry fe, Milk, and Corrie; all of which abound with a variety of fish ; and their banks afford many fine meadows and rich holm ground : the Dryfe, which rises in the Northern end of the Parish of Hutton, and runs a course directly South about 11 miles, is, in moderate weather, a small rivulet, clear and pure; but, in rainy weather, it comes doAvn in swells, suddenly and rapidly, driving all before it that is in its way ; hence the name, which is imparted to the dale through which it flows. The air is dry, and healthy : the spring, in favourable seasons, is early : the summer is sometimes extremely hot : the harvest is early on the Western side : Winter is stormy and cold, being accompanied with high winds, and heavy rains, but seldom any continuation of snow, though there is a prevalence of frost, in some seasons, for upwards of one, two, or three months together, which is always reckoned a preparation for, and a prognostication of, a kindly spring, a nourishing summer, and plentiful harvest. Peats are scarce : coals are brought from the distance of 30 and 40 miles, and are consequently sold dear. There is abundance of excellent marl. The great Post-road, from London to Edinburgh and Glasgow, runs through Lockerby and this Parish; along Avhich, immense droves of black cattle pass in the spring, and autumn : the private roads are in good repair. A spirit of agricultural improvement is prevalent here ; and, as the grain is of the best quality, it commands the highest price. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, and the interest of a mortification of \u00a380., together with the common School-fees : There are several private Schools also. Curling on the ice in winter is a favourite diversion here. On the Holm of Dryfe, about half a mile below the old Church-yard, are two very aged Thorn-trees, with a tumulus at their base, called Maxwell's Thorns ; because they point out the place ofthe remarkable fight on Dryfe sands, between vol. i. 3 G"], [474, "DRY the Maxwells of Nithsdale, and the Johnstons of Annandale, on the 7th of December 1593, in which the former were defeated Avith great slaughter. At Old Walls, KirktoAvn-Mains, Nether-Place, Myre-head, and Dalton-hook, are vestiges of strong Towers. Tliere are evident remains of eight ancient camps or forts ; the most remarkable of avIi ich are, one British, and another Roman, facing each other, and separated by a narrow morass : they are situate on two hills, East ofthe Village Bengali, i. e. The Hillofthe Gauls: old pieces of armour and Avarlike weapons have frequently been found in them, and not many years ago, the skeleton ofa man was discovered in a cairn, on the intervening morass, together with some fragments of his dress, and particularly his sandals, which were sent to the Museum at Oxford. Another Roman Fort, beautifully situate upon a large eminence, in the centre ofthe united and extensive holm of Dryfe and Annan, is called The Gallaberry, or The Burgh and Station of the Gauls. The most entire British fort is the one at Dry's-dale Gate, which occupies about two acres of ground , and commands a most extensive prospect : its counterpart is a large Roman one, about half a mile due East, interrupted by a moor, being the place which is celebrated for the bloody battle between the army of Julius Agricola and the forces of Corbredus Galdus, an ancient Scottish King. There are manifest traces ofthe great Roman Road, from the borders of England to the vast encampments on the neighbouring eminence of Birrenswork ; thence crossing this Parish at Lockerbie to Dry's-dale Gate, and up to The Gallaberry, above mentioned, Avhere it divided ; one branch leading up through Annandale, by Moffat, to Tweed-dale and Clyde's-dale ; the other branch crossing the Annan, touched an entire and beautiful double fort on the Northern margin of one of the Lochmaben lakes, called The Woody Castle, and thence passed up the West side of the Avater of Ae, through Nith's-dale to the West coun try. The Highland part of the Parish, which is divided from the Lowlands by a range of green hills, was once a Parish of itself, called Little Hutton, in contrast to the large conterminous Parish of Hutton : the Church, and Burying ground, had been at Hall-dykes, for, in the garden, human bones are frequently dug up; but there is no tradition of the time of its annexation to Dryfe's-dale. Besides this Church of Little Hutton, there were two other places of Public Worship in the Parish, viz., The Chapel of Beekton, which is supposed to have belonged to the Knights' Templars, about half a mile North-West from Lockerby, Avhere the traces of graves are still evident, and at which there is a most copious and excellent spring : \u2014 And the Chapel at Quaas, about a quarter of a mile"], [475, "DRY West from Lockerby, the Font-stone of which serves for the Market-Cross of Lockerby to the present day.

It is in the Presbytery of Dumbarton, and Synod of Glas gow and Ayr. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 1607, and, in 1811, was 1628. It is 55 m. W.b. N. from Edinburgh. A General Post- Office is established here. This Parish, where inhabited, is about 15 miles in length, but the moors extend considerably farther : its greatest breadth is about 9 miles: the soil is in general poor, wet, and tilly, except on the banks of the rivers where it is more productive. In some places the country is rugged and mountainous ; in others, flat and level ; but for the most part; it is an irregular slope, intersected by a number of small rapid streams, of which the Duchray, the Forth, and the Enrick, are the chief, and abound with fish. The climate is very wet, but not unhealthy. Peats, and turf, are the most common fuel ; but coals, brought from Kill-Patrick at the distance of 12 miles, have of late been pretty much used. The Gaelic language is principally spoken here.

It is in the Presbytery of Edinburgh, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (consisting ofthe Villages of Easter and Wester Dudingston, Porto-Bello, and Brickfield,) was 1003, and, in 1811, was 1533. It is \\\\ m E. from Edinburgh. This Parish extends from the foot of Arthur's Seat about four miles in length, gradually in creasing in breadth to the Eastern extremity, which is nearly two miles broad : it is highly cultivated, and Avell inclosed. Wester Dudingston was formerly a large and populous Village, most of the tenants upon the Barony residing in it, prior to the year 1751 : when there were several weavers' looms, chiefly employed in manufacturing a very coarse flaxen stuff, then known by the name of Duding ston Hardings; but the trade has declined, and there are now only five weavers remaining in the Village. Easter Dudingston is mostly occupied by Colliers. Porto-Bello, and Brickfield, now the most populous and prosperous Villages ofthe Parish, are but of Aery recent origin and name. The ground on which they are built, is a part of The Figget Lands, which altogether consist of about"], [477, "DUD 70 acres : these continued down to the year 1762 or 1763 a mere Avaste, covered for the most part with furze or whins, and were commonly let for 200 merks Scotch to one ofthe Dudingston tenants : in one or other ofthe above-mentioned years, the lands of Figget were sold for \u00a31500. Sterling: the purchaser imme diately began to improve his property, and in a few years parcelled it out into different feus at the rate of \u00a32.. 2.. 0., and sometimes even more, per acre : he soon indemnified himself for the expenses of improvement with the crops which he raised, and by the feu duties insured an annual income of about 7 per cent, for the original price. Porto-Bello Hut was the first House raised in the midst of the original waste, about the year 1742, and derived its appellation from the Spanish American City of that Name, ofthe capture of Avhich, the news had ar rived in England about that period. Since the cultivation and improvements of the neighbouring soil, besides the ordinary houses required for the Brick, Pottery, and Tile manufactures at Brickfield, a number of elegant and commodious edi fices have been erected by the feuers, either for their oavii accommodation or for the company who resort hither for Sea-bathing in the Firth of Forth; and for which the agreeable smoothness of the adjacent sandy beach, the purity of the air, and the convenience of the great London road form obvious recommenda tions. Salt has long been prepared in great quantities in this Parish. During the reign of William the Lion, the Monks of Kelso acquired the Church and lands of Dudingston ; within the Barony of which, the Abbots appointed their Baron Baillies. In 1630, the lands of Prestonfield were disjoined from the Kirk and Parish of St. Cuthbert, and annexed to Dudingston; and, by an act of the Presbytery of Edinburgh, dated the 18th of May 1631, an aisle Avas ordained to be added to the Kirk of Dudingston, for the accommodation of the proprietor of Prestonfield and his Tenants, to be built and supported at his expense. The Barony of Dudingston, which comprehends the greatest part of the whole Parish, for a considerable period continued in the possession of the Family of Thomson, of whom Sir Thomas was created a Baronet by Charles the First, in 1637. In 1674, it appears that the estate had fallen into the hands of The Duke of Lauderdale : it passed with a daughter of his first Duchess, under the name of Pin-money to the family of Argyle, to the first Duke of which she was married. In 1745, it was sold by Archibald Duke of Argyle to James Earl of Abercorn, who, in 1763, began to build here his magnificent Mansion, according to a noble design ofthe late Sir William Chambers ; the house, and offices, were finished, in 1768, and exhibit a beautiful specimen of Greek architecture and elegance,"], [478, "D U F and of superb accommodation and affluence.

This Parish extends 5 miles in length, from East to West, along the South Coast ofthe Moray Firth, and is from two to three miles in breadth : it is one continued plain, except a small rising ground near the middle ofthe Parish, which is every where arable : Along the coast there is a sandy space of half a mile in breadth, covered with a meagre, green, benty pasture : all of which was formerly a rich cultivated soil, but, for many years, has been overwhelmed with sand from the Western shore : however, as the sand has now ceased to blow, the proprietors have hopes of bringing a great part of it again into culture, by the application ofthe spade, or trench plough: The rest of the Parish is a fertile clay soil, capable of producing any kind of grain. The climate is healthy. Con siderable Plantations have lately been made in this Parish. Some Services are still continued here; and, upon one Estate, the tenth sheaf is drawn in Teind from the field, as part ofthe Rent. It is remarkable for the large size, and good quality of its Poultry. The great disadvantage under Avhich this Parish labours, is the want of fuel ; the mosses here are utterly exhausted, and it depends chiefly on Northumberland for coals, which are imported at a high price. The Roads are tolerable. At the West end of the Parish, is an Obelisk, which is conjec tured to be the same that, Historians say, was erected in commemoration ofthe victory obtained by Malcolm the Second over Camus the Dane : and near this Monument, there is a Village called Kaim, which is supposed to be the village mentioned by Buchanan, as retaining the memorable name of Camus. On the North West border ofthe Lake of Spynie, there are still standing, upon an arti ficial mound, the Avails ofa strong Castle, called Old Duffus: it is known to be of great antiquity, but at Avhat precise time it was erected, or who were the ori ginal proprietors, cannot be traced with any degree of certainty. The Village of Duffus is regularly built, having a square, in the centre of which is the Church,"], [479, "D U L and four streets leading from it, neatly paved, and which are said to be the Avork manship of some of Oliver Cromavell's soldiers, who were settled here. It gave title of Baron to the Family of Sutherland, attainted for their concern in the Rebellion of 1715. Two new Fishing Villages have been built within this Parish, since the year 1801. Limestone is abundant, and along the coast are Quarries of fine free-stone. See, Burgh-Head.

This Parish is about 17 computed miles in length, and 13 miles in breadth'. The ground about the Lochs or Branches ofthe Sea, which run far into the country, descends in some places with a quick, and, in others, with an easy slope towards the shore. The Promontories or Head-lands are rocks of immense height, with a great depth of water near them, and along the whole coast. The Moors are, in most places, deep and wet : the soil is partly a light black loam, and partly ofa reddish gra velly appearance ; and, though mostly thin and stony, is, on the whole, fertile and productive. The air is very moist, and foggy. This Parish exports about 20 tons of ling annually ; and also about 100 tons of kelp. The most remarkable mountains are the two Hallivails. Here are the ruins of several Danish Forts. The language commonly spoken is the Gaelic. Some indications of coal have lately been discovered. The Church-yard, according to Mr. Boswell, is not inclosed, but a pretty murmuring brook runs along one side of it. In it is a Pyramid, of free-stone, about 30 feet high, with a pompous inscription to the Memory of Thomas Lord Lovat, by his son Lord Simon, who suffered on Tower- Hill. See, Snizort.

This is a very extensiA*e Highland Parish, being 30 miles from North to South, and 12 miles from East to West ; but, it is so much intersected by other Parishes, that its exact form cannot be described It is watered by the rivers Tay, and Tum mel, along the banks of which the surface is level, and the soil tolerably fertile ; but the greater part is mountainous, and appropriated to the pasturage of sheep. Fuel is exceedingly scarce. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites. The great Military road, from Stirling to Inverness, passes through the whole length of the Parish : and the other roads are in tolerable repair. Here are many Druidical circles, and a great number of ancient Castles or Watch-Towers. This Parish is divided into five Districts; \u2014 First, The District of Appin, in which the Parish Chinch stands, and which is an open haugh or plain, on the banks ofthe Tay; \u2014 Secondly, The District of Grandtully, Avhere there is a Chapel, at the distance of 6 miles from Dull, and in which the Minister preaches occasionally ; \u2014 Thirdly, The District of Amulrie, 12 miles distant from Appin, and in which there is a Missionary, Avho is supported by the Committee for managing the Royal Bounty; \u2014 Fourthly, The District of Foss, 8 miles from the Church, and in which there is a Chapel where the Missionary of Rannoch preaches every third Sunday , \u2014 and, Fifthly, The District of Fincastle, 15 miles from Appin, and to which the Minister travels across very lofty hills three or four times a year, for the performance of his Clerical functions. The Minister of this Parish receives 5 bolls of bear, and 7 bolls 3 firlots of white oats annually, out ofthe Teinds of Ferry- Port-on-Craig, in Fife. See, Grandtully. DULSIE, BRIDGE, v.

It is in the Presbytery of Dumbarton,"], [481, "DUM and Synod of GlasgoAv and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 2541, and, in 1811, (including The Castle, and Castle Green) was 3121, It is 58 m. W. b. S. from Edinburgh. The Market is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the third Tuesday in March, Thursday before Easter, third Tuesday in May, second Wednesday, O. S., in August, and second Tuesday in November. A General Post-Office is established here. This is one ofthe most ancient Towns of Scotland, and is pleasantly situate on the banks of the river Leven, Avhich is navigable for coasting vessels as far above the Town as the tide flows. It was erected into a Royal Borough by Alexander the Second, in the year 1221, and was declared to be entirely free of all imposts or borough taxes : but, notwithstanding this material advantage, and the excel lent harbour which it possesses, it is by no means in a flourishing state ; owing to the Corporation Laws, Avhich prevent strangers from working at their trades, without paying high fees of entry : The Glass-works are, however, very con siderable ; and the manufacture of muslin has been introduced with good effect. There are about 200 acres of Commonty belonging to the Town, and the Fisheries in the Leven and the Clyde are very productive. Coal is the fuel generally used here. There are two Public Schools, with a Salary of 300 merks to each, together with School-fees. This is the Shire Town. It is said to have been once the Capital of a Kingdom of the Britons, established in the Vale of the Clyde, and to have been one of the Seats of Fingal, called in the Poems of Ossian, Tlie Tower of Balclutha. The Parish of Dumbarton is from two to three miles in length, and from one to two miles in breadth : a great part of the surface is flat, the remainder ascending gradu ally to the neighbouring hills, with a Southern exposure: the soil is fertile, but rather shallow. The air is salubrious, except at times when a heavy fog rises from, and hovers over the Clyde and Leven. The Roads are excellent. Packets sail every day to Greeenock, and Port Glasgow ; and a Stage-coach sets out three times a week to GlasgoAv. Here is plenty of free-stone, both ofa white and red colour. The Castle of Dumbarton lies at a small distance West ward from the Town, upon the summit of an insulated rocky hill, at the junction ofthe Clyde and Leven: many parts of the rock are strongly magnetic, the powers of which have been ascertained by Professor Anderson of GlasgoAv, and who has also marked the variation ofthe Poles. As this Castle commands the navi- gation ofthe Clyde, and is the Key ofthe Western Highlands, the Fortifications are kept in repair ; and it is garrisoned by a Governor, Lieutenant-Governor^ a vol. i. 3 H"], [482, "DUM Fort-Major, Subaltern Officers, and a Company of Invalids. The French General Simon is noAv a State Prisoner here. Dumbarton anciently gave the title of Earl to a branch ofthe Illustrious Family of Douglas, noAv extinct. It now, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of Rutherglen, Glasgow, and Renfrew, sends one Member to Parliament. The true Scotch Thistle, a rare plant, having its light green leaves variegated with Avhite, grows in considerable quantity about the bottom ofthe rock, and sparingly even upon its very summit. The Roman fleet, in all probability, had its Station under Dumbarton ; Avhich, according to Boethius, resisted all the efforts of Agricola, who besieged it : and Bede observes, that it was the strongest fortification possessed by the Bri tons in his days. It was reduced by famine, in the reign of Egbert King of Northumberland, in 756 ; and, in 1571, by a bold and singular enterprise, when Lord Fleming, was governor of it, by commission from the banished Queen. The Collegiate Church of Dumbarton was founded by Isabel, Countess of Lennox and Duchess of Albany, about the year 1450, and dedicated to St. Patrick, the Apostle of Ireland, who is said to have been born in the District of Lennox .* it was well endowed. DUMBARTON, SHIRE. This Avas anciently called, The Shire of Lennox. It contains 309 square miles, or 125,216 square Scotch acres : and tAvelve Par ishes, two of which, Kirkintilloch, and Cumbemauld, are separated from the rest of the County by a part ofthe Shire of Lanark. These two Parishes an ciently belonged to the Shire of Stirling ; but, in consequence of an application of The Earl of Wigtoavn, their Proprietor, they were annexed to the County of Dumbarton, of which The Earl Avas then the Heritable Sheriff. From its vicinity to the Alantic Ocean, and from the many high Mountains withAvhich it abounds, the climate is extremely wet, and variable. It is principally appropriated to pas turage. The Resident Population of this Shire, in 1801, was 20,710, and, in 1811, AA*as 24,189. It sends one Member to Parliament. The Duke of Montrose is Hereditary Sheriff of the Shire of Dumbarton.

It is in the Presbytery, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, Avas 7288, and, in 1811, was 9262. It is 71| m. S. b. W. from Edinburgh. The Markets are on Wednesday, and Friday. The Fairs are holden on the 24th of February, and on Rood day in October. It is pleasantly situate on the Eastern bank of the river Nith, about 9 miles above where it discharges itself into the Solway Firth, and which is navigable in spring tides, for vessels of from 30 to 40 tons burden up to the Town ; but great improvements are making in its navigation. It is neat, and well built, and from its convenient and healthy situation, and the amusements which it affords, many ofthe gentry from the neighbouring Counties are induced to spend in it a great part of the year. It is governed by a Provost, three Baillies, a Treasurer, a Dean of Guild, twelve Merchant Counsellors, and seven Deacons, of the Incorporated Trades. The ancient Bridge OA*er the Nith, of which Mr. Grose has preserved a view, was originally built by Devorgilla, av1io gave the customs arising from it to the Franciscan Convent : it consists of nine arches, and connects the Shire of Dumfries, and the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, at a large village, formerly called Bridge-End, but now denominated Maxwell- Toivn. The Revenue of the Town may be estimated at upwards of \u00a3200. Sterling per annum, besides a considerable sum annually raised, by virtue of an Act of Par liament, for the better regulation ofthe Police. Dumfries, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of Kirkcudbright, Annan, Lochmaben, and Sanquhar, sends one Member to Parliament. This is the Shire Town ; and here the High Court of Justiciary for the Southern District is holden during the Spring, and Autumn Circuits. It is also the Seat of the Commissary Courts, and of the Presbytery and Synod : and where the Justices of the Peace for the County hold their Quarter Sessions. A General Post-Office is established here. The Port of Dumfries extends from Southwick, in theParish of Colvend, up the Solway Firth, to the Foot of Sark Water : in the Avhole of this tract of coast, vessels receive and discharge cargoes no where, except in the river Nith, below Dumfries, and at Annan, where only a very small share of business is done. Two weekly Newspapers are published here. The establishments for education in Dumfries have long been in considerable reputation : these are almost all Public Institutions, under the Protection and Patronage ofthe Magistrates, who. 3H2 N"], [484, "DUM on every vacancy, take great pains to fill the Schools Avith teachers of character and ability. The Infirmary, Avhich was opened in 1777, has fully answered the expectations and benevolent intention of its promoters. The Fiars of this Shire are struck by the peck : the Dumfries peck of oats and barley is accounted better than the Winchester bushel ; the same measure of wheat, one-third less. The fuel used here is coals from Sanquhar, or from Cumberland, and peats from Lochar Moss : but coals, upon the whole, are esteemed the cheaper article. Dumfries gives the title of Earl to the Chief ofthe Ancient and Noble family of Crichton. While England and Scotland were separate Kingdoms, Dumfries was a place of strength, where the Scotch Borderers retired from the hostile in cursions ofthe English : the noble family of Maxwell, Barons Herries, and Earls of Nithsdale, being possessors of the Castle, and in some measure Lords of the ToAvn. The Street in which the Convent of Franciscans or Grey Friars formerly stood, is still called Friars' Vennel ; and a small part of what is thought to have been the Kitchen or Dormitory is still visible. This Convent AA'as founded by Dervorgilla, daughter to Alan Lord of Galloway, and mother to John Baliol King of Scotland : in the Church ofthis place, Robert Bruce and his associates sleAv Red John Cuming, Lord of Badenoch, and owner of great part of the Lordship of Galloway, in 1305 : Cuming had betrayed to Edward the First, the generous design of Bruce to relieve his country from slavery, and in resentment Bruce stabbed him before the High Altar ; on retiring, he was asked by his friends, whether he was sure of his bloAv, but answering with some de gree of uncertainty, one of them, Roger Kirkpatrick, replied, \" I mac sicker,\" returned into the Church, and completed the deed. In memory of which, the family assumed a bloody dagger for a crest, and those Avords as the motto. The Church thus defiled with blood, was pulled down ; and another built in a dif ferent place, and dedicated to St. Michael, the Tutelar Saint ofthe Town. John Duns Scotus, surnamed The Subtle Doctor, was here clothed with the habit of St. Francis: he died at Cologne, on the 8th of November 1308, in the Thirty fourth year of his age. At the entrance into the Town from the North-East, are the remains ofthe foundation of an old Chapel, called The Chrystal, or more properly St. Christopher's Chapel: it was built by King Robert Bruce, as a place in which Mass might be said for the soul of his father-in-law, Sir Chris topher Seton, who was barbarously executed on this spot by order of Edward the First, for his defence of his country : the walls of it were demolished in 1715, and the materials employed in the temporary works then raisedfor defence against"], [485, "DUM the Rebels. In the Tenth Volume of Archaeologia, p. 481, tliere is an engrav ing ofa brass ring, Avhich was discovered several years ago, near the site of the Friary ; and along with it, a number of English coins was found, but none of them were older than the reign of Edavard the Fourth : this communication Avas very obligingly made to The Society of Antiquaries of London, in 1791, by Robert Riddell, Esq., of Friars' Carse. The Parish of Dumfries is about 6 miles in length, and from two to three miles in breadth, stretching along the Eastern bank of the river Nith. This tract of country may be considered as an extensive Vale ; and the hills with Avhich it is bounded, are either cultivated to their summits, or planted with clumps of Avood ; and the Avhole scene is pic turesque in a high degree. Agriculture is much encouraged here. The Burgh Roods consist of upwards of 500 acres, and are parcelled out among many small heritors and feuers. The Nith abounds with fish of various kinds. The late Ebenezer Gilchrist, M. D., a Physician ofthe first eminence, and highly distinguished in Literature, was a native ofthis Parish ; as were also, William Wight, D.D., Professor of Divinity in Glasgow, and Andrew Crosbie, Esq., of Holm, Advocate ; men whose talents do honour to their Profession. The Roads are in good repair. Edward the First built a small Castle here, during the winter of 1300 ; bringing materials, and workmen, from the North of Eng land, at a vast expense. Dumfries was continually subject to the inroads ofthe English, and was frequently ruined by them. To prevent their invasions a great ditch and mound, according to Mr. Pennant, called Warders Dikes, were formed from the Nith to Lockar Moss, where Watch and Ward were con stantly kept ; and when an enemy appeared, the cry was a Lorebum, a Lore bum ! The meaning is no further knoAvn than that it was a word of alarm for the inhabitants to take to their arms ; and the same word, as a memento of vigilance, is inscribed on a ring of silver round the ebony staff given into the hands of the Provost as a Badge of Office, on the day of annual election. On most of the eminences of these parts, Beacons were likewise established for alarming the country on any eruption of their Southern neighbours ; and the inhabitants able to bear arms were bound, on the firing of these signals, to repair instantly to the Warden of the Marches, and not to depart until the enemy Avas driven out of the country ; and this under pain of High Treason. This regulation was established in the time of Archibald the Grim, Earl of Douglas, and after wards renewed with much solemnity by William Earl of Douglas, who assem bled the Lords, Freeholders, and principal Borderers at The College of"], [486, "DUN Lincluden, and caused them there to swear on the Holy Evangelists, 'that they should truly observe the Statutes, Ordinances, and Usages of the Marches, as they Avere ordained by his Predecessor. DUMFRIES, SHIRE. It is about 44 miles in length, and 34 miles in breadth ; containing about 672,000 Scotch acres. It is watered by the three large rivers Esk, Annan, and Nith, which divide it into three great Districts, to which they respectively give their names : the Easternmost one being called The Regality of Esk-Dale, the middle one The Stewartry of Annan-Dale, and the Western most one The old Sheriffdom of Nith's-Dale. A great part of the Shire is moun tainous ; but the vallies are extremely fertile, and pleasant. The climate is various. Its Resident Population, in 1801, was 54,597, and, in 1811, Avas 62,960. It was anciently inhabited by the Selgovce, and constituted a part of the Roman Province of Valentia. It sends one Member to Parliament. The moun tains abound with valuable minerals. DUMGOIACK HILL, v. STRATH BLANE. DUN, in the Shire of Forfar: formerly a Chapelry, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 12 bolls of wheat, 60 bolls of meal, 45 bolls of bear, and \u00a317.. 18.. 6f. Sterling: the manse, which Avas built about 60 years ago, was then the best in the Presbytery, but it is not noAv in very good repair : the glebe consists of nearly 6 acres, of very good arable land : Patron, John Erskine, Esq. : The Church, Avhich is situate within Mr. Erskirie's inclosures, is very old, long, and narrow, but in pretty good condition. It is in the Presbytery of Brechin, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 651, and, in 1811, was 680. It is 4 m. E. from Brechin. This Parish is about 4 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth. The name of the Parish is descriptive of its appearance : it rises considerably above the level of the sea, but so gradually as greatly to increase the beauty of the scenery, without rendering it unfit for agri culture. The soil is various : the lower lands, along the side of the Montrose Bason, being a strong clay or carse land, excellently adapted for Avheat and beans : the rising ground, for about a mile, is fine black earth, fit for every pur pose ; but, beyond that, to the North, it is very bleak and moorish. A part of the Muir has been improved at a great expense ; but, though producing the first year a good crop of wheat, it scarcely repays the cost, always tending again to a state of nature if not constantly stimulated with lime and manure : a few houses have also lately been built upon it, and a few acres let for a term of years at a low rent, with the view of bringing it into cultivation. The proportion of good"], [487, "DUN. land is nearly as 3 to 1. To the Eastward, towards Montrose, the soil is light and gravelly, and well adapted for green crops and barley. The grass Parks of Dun are famous for rich and early vegetation, having a fine Southern exposure ; and let higher than any in this Eastern part of the County, being from \u00a35. to \u00a36. per acre. It is watered, and bounded on the South, by the river South Esk, which affords a good salmon fishing ; and over which there is a handsome stone bridge, of three large arches, erected in the year 1787. The Public road is ex cellent. The Sai* ry ofthe Parochial School is 350 merks, with an allowance in money in lieu ofa garden. The House of Dun is the hospitable Mansion ofthe ancient Family of Erskine, and is surrounded with several very large Elm, and Beech trees: and, within the Garden, is a venerable Hawthorn Tree of very un common size, which is said to have stood three Centuries : it was overthrown by a storm of wind four years ago, and has since been propped up, but it does not appear to send forth fresh shoots. The Dun Family are reckoned second in anti quity to the Erskines, of Marr. John Erskine, Superintendant of Angus, makes a conspicuous figure in the reign of Mary, and in the Reformation. The present House was built in the year 1730, by Lord Dun. Upon the brink of the hill, a little to the South East ofthe Church, are some remains ofthe old Castle. The arm ofthe sea, commonly called The Montrose Bason, belongs to the Estate and Parish of Dun, that is, all that portion which lies on this side ofthe Esk. Vari ous proposals have been made for excluding the sea, and converting this Bason into arable land, which would add a great quantity of rich carse ground to this Parish : This will become a great object to the Proprietor ofthe Estate of Dun, if the decision of the House of Peers should confirm the recent decision of The Court of Session, against the Stake fishing. In the North-West part of the Parish, is a Lake, called Duns-Dish, of about a mile in length and half a mile in breadth : a small stream flows from it, in a South- East direction, nearly bisecting the Parish, and aster turning a Corn-mill, and three Threshing-mills, empties itself into the Bason of Montrose. DUNAN, CHAPEL, v. INVER-AVON. DUNAVERTY, CASTLE, v. SOUTHEND. DUNBAR, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Shire of Hadington _ formerly a Rectory, with the Rectory of Belton annexed; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 23 bolls of wheat, 65 bolls of barley, 23 bolls of oats, and 7 bolls of pease, with \u00a334. Sterling, and a glebe of 5 English acres ; there is a very good manse, which Avas built in 1776:"], [488, "DUN Patron, The Duke of Roxburgh, avIio is also Titular of the Tythes, Avhich are very considerable in this Parish: The Church is very old, and is built in the form of a Cross. The Parish of Dunbar, according to Mr. Chalmers, was of old the most valuable of any in the Deanery of Lothian, or indeed within the Diocese of St. Andrews. Besides the present Parish, it contained the Paro chial Districts of Whittingham, Stenton, and Spot, which were anciently Cha pelries, that Avere subordinate to the Mother Church of Dunbar. From the earliest times, of which Ave have any accurate account, The Earls of Dunbar Avere Proprietors ofthe whole Parish, and Patrons ofthe Church, and the subordinate Chapels. In 1342, George Earl of March converted the Parochial Church into a Collegiate form, for a Dean, and Arch-Priest, and the Eight Prebends, which he established, were the Chapelries of Whittingham, Spot, Stenton, Penshiel, and Hetherwick, within this Parish, with Dunse, and Chirnside, in the Shire of Berwick. Soon after that establishment, several of those Chapelries, Spot, Stenton, and Hethenvick, were converted into Parisii Churches, indepen dant of the Mother Church, yet dependant as Prebends of the College. Spot, and Stenton, still continue separate Parishes. When Hetherwick was made a distinct Parish, it was called Belton, being the name of two Villages, in the vicinity of Hetherwick, as well as the estate: and, the Parish of Belton compre hended the Western extremity of the present Parish of Dunbar. It continued a separate Parish, until the Reformation ,\u00b0w hen it was re-annexed to Dunbar ; and when the Church of Dunbar ceased to be Collegiate. The Patronage of the Church, with the Earldom of Dunbar, fell to the CroAvn, on the forfeiture ofthe traitorous Duke of Albany, in 1483. It is in the Presbytery of Dunbar, and Sy nod of Lothian and TAveeddale The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, (comprising the Villages of Belhaven, within the Royalty, West Barns, Hethenvick or Belton, East Barns, and Pinkerton) was 3951, and, in 1811, was 3982. It is 28 m. E. b. N. from Edinburgh, and 362 m. N. from London. The Market is on Thursday. The Fairs are holden on the first Tues days after the 26th of May, and 22d of November. It was made a Royal Bo rough, by a Charter from King David the Second, about the middle ofthe Four teenth Century, with limits as extensive as the Earldom of March : and is united Avith Hadington, North Berwick, Jedburgh, and Lauder, in sending one Member to Parliament. It is governed by a Provost, three Baillies, a Trea surer, and fifteen Counsellors. The Revenue amounts to about \u00a3500. Sterling a year. This Town is centrally situate, on the German Ocean, between Edinburgh"], [489, "DUN and Berwick upon Tweed, being 28 miles distant from each. It stands on a gentle eminence, at the bottom ofthe small Bay, or Harbour of Dunbar. The principal Street is broad and spacious, and the Houses, which are mostly new, have a neat appearance. It is remarkably healthy, as is the Parish in general. It is well supplied with good soft water, conveyed in leaden pipes from the dis tance of above two miles ; this was done, in 1766, at a great expense, when the Streets were also new paved. The Harbour Avas originally at Belhaven, about a mile to the WestAvard ; the East pier ofthe present Harbour was begun during the Protectorate of Cromwell, avIio granted \u00a3300. towards defraying the expense : it was still, however, very imperfect, being capable of receiving only a few small vessels : but, early in the Eighteenth Century, it was enlarged and deepened, by digging eight feet into the solid rock, and at the same time very commodious Quays were built : and though it has since been much improved, yet it is small, and of difficult access : it is defended by a Battery of twelve Guns, of 9, 12, and 18 pounders. Here is a large and convenient dry dock. It was erected by an Exchequer Commission into a Custom-House Port, having a Collector and Comptroller, a Land Surveyor, a Tide Surveyor, four Tide-waiters, and a Custom-house Boat with seven men belonging to it; and extending from Berwick Bounds on the South, to Tyne water on the North. It has a concurrent commerce with Hadington, which has also a concurrent com merce with Dunbar. A number of Fishing boats are fitted out from this Town ; but its principal export is Corn, of which there are annually shipped off about 10,000 quarters. Here is an extensive Rope-walk. The Parisii of Dunbar extends about 9 miles along the Coast, and is at a medium nearly two miles in breadth. The face of the country is pleasant, rising gradually from the Coast, which is generally low and sandy : from the back grounds, the prospect is very extensive. The soil is rich, and, perhaps, the most fertile in Scotland: it is partly a deep loam, partly clay, and partly a light mould: most ofthe fields are inclosed with stone walls, or thorn hedges. The Farmers are in general opulent and respectable, and are always ready to adopt any plan which tends to improvement. Sea-ware is much used for manure, and with good suc cess: and there is plenty of limestone. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. It is a General Post-Office Town. The Parish is watered by two small rivers, the Tyne and the Biel, which fall into the Ocean near the Town. Here are frequently found those beautiful specimens of geddes or septaria, iron ore, gene rally termed the geddes of Dunbar. There are three Schools in Dunbar, a Gram mar School, a Mathematical, and an English one : the Masters of which have each vol. i. 31"], [490, "DUN a House, and good Salary, and they are chosen, and paid by the Town. There were formerly two Monasteries in the Parish, both founded by Patrick Earl of March: one of Red Friars, in 1218, the other of White Friars, in 1263. The venerable ruins of the Castle are justly esteemed a remarkable piece of antiquity : it is situate upon a reef of rocks projecting into the sea, which in many- places flows under them through caverns formed by fissures in the stone : the time of its erection is not known ; but it is mentioned as early as the year 858, when it Avas burned by Kenneth, King of Scotland : it was long deemed one of the keys ofthe kingdom : it was often besieged, and as often bravely defended. In 1314, Edward the Second, after his defeat at the battle of Bannockburn, took refuge in this Castle, where he was received by The Earl of March ; and from thence went by sea to Berwick in his way to England. In 1337-8, The Earl of March being absent, it was besieged by The Earl of Salisbury, and defended by the Heroine his wife, who, from the dark colour of her complexion, Avas vulgarly called, \" Black Agnes:\" this Lady, during a siege of nineteen weeks, performed all the duties of a bold, and vigilant commander, animating the garrison by her exhortations, munificence, and example : aud finally compelled her opponent Salisbury to raise the siege, and leave the country. In 1565, after the death of Rizzio, Queen Mary retired to this Castle, where she was joined by a number of her friends ; and, in 1567, she and \" the infamous\" Bothwell, having fled from Edinburgh, were pursued with such vigour by a party of horse, commanded by Lord Home, that they had barely time to reach this fortress ; from Avhence she marched Avith an army, composed of Bothwell's friends and dependants, to Carberry Hill, where, being abandoned by them, she surrendered herself prisoner, and was sent to Loch Leven Castle. In 1567, it Avas taken from Bothwell's dependants by The Earl of Murray, Regent of Scotland, and demo- lished, and the artillery was carried to Edinburgh, by order of the Parliament. It is built with a reddish stone : several ofthe Towers had a communication with the water : under the front is a very large cavern of black and some red stone, which is said to have been the pit or dungeon for confining prisoners. Mr. Grose has preserved two views of it. In this Parish is part of Down Hill, fa- mous for the encampment of General Leslie and the Scottish army, the night before their defeat at the battle of Dunbar, in 1650, by Cromwell. There are three Corn mills, to which the Town and some estates in the country are thirled; \" a wretched piece of Police !\" and quite unAvorthy of the good sense, and liber- ality ofthe Heritors here. At the West end of Dunbar, The Earl of Lauderdale has built a very elegant House. On the abolition of Hereditary Jurisdictions, in"], [491, "DUN 1748, John Hay was paid \u00a3800. Sterling, for the Bailliery of Dunbar. Dunbar gave the title of Viscount to the Family of Constable, now dormant or extinct. It also gave the title of Earl to the family of Hume, which was forfeited in 1715. DUNBARNY, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Rectory arid Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 814 merks Scotch in money, and the Vicarage Teind, 4 chalders of victual, of which 40 bolls are payable in oatmeal, and 24 bolls in bear, together with \u00a38. .6.. 8. for Communion elements: the glebe con sists of more than the legal extent : Patrons, The Magistrates and Town Council of Edinburgh, Avho are also Titulars of the Teinds: The Church, and Manse, were originally situate at the extremity of the Parish, to the West ; which being very incommodious, they were, in the year 1689, built near the Bridge of Earn, and are now about the centre of the Parish : the Parishioners, however, still continue to occupy the old Burying-ground, and none of them bury in the ground about the present Church : There was formerty a Chapel at Moncrieff, and a Church at Kirk-Pottie, both of them appendages to the Church at Dunbarny : The former is now the Burying-place ofthe Family of Moncrieff, but the latter is long since in ruins ; and the Estate of Kirk-Pottie, and other lands, belonging to the Parish of Dunbarny, were, in the year 1652, annexed, quoad sacra, to the Parish of Dron, by reason of their great distance from the Church of Dunbarny. It is in the Presbytery of Perth, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resi dent Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1066, and, in 1811, AVas 1037. It is 4 m. S. from Perth. This Parish is about 4 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth, occupying the most beautiful part of Strath-Earn. The soil varies from clay to a loam and light sand, but is, in general, very fertile. Considerable Plantations have lately been made here ; and the celebrated Mr. Pennant, on account ofthe richness and variety ofthe prospect from the Hill of Mordun or Moncrieff, calls it .. The Glory of Scotland.\" The river Earn, which flows through the Parish, has its source in the Loch of that name, and unites with the Tay about three miles below the Bridge : this Bridge is supposed to be of great antiquity, and is kept in repair by the Magistrates of Perth, for which a toll is collected : sloops of from 30 to 50 tons burden come up to the bridge, with lime and coals ; but the tide flows about two miles above it. The Salary of the Pa rochial School is 300 merks Scotch, Avhich, with about three quarters of an acre ofland, and other emoluments, amount to upwards of \u00a330. Sterling per annum. The saline and purgative waters of The Wells of Pitkeathly have long been famed for their efficacy in scrophulous, herpetic, and scorbutic complaints. There are 312"], [492, "D U N five distinct Springs, all ofthe same quality, butos different degrees of strength. In the year 1771, some experiments Avere made on one ofthe mineral Springs, by Donald Monro, M. D., Physician to the Army, Avhich, in 1772, together with a Letter from Dr. Wood, of Perth, on the same subject, were published in the Sixty-Second volume, p. 27. of The Philosophical Transactions. And, in 1792, Messrs. Stodart and Mitchel, druggists in Perth, gave a further analysis of these Avaters. The Village of Pitkeathly is delightfully situate in a sequestered corner ofthe vale of Strath-Earn, and affords good accommodation for Invalids. DUNBEATH, in the Shire of Caithness : an ancient Parish, hoav compre hended in the Parish of Latheron. It is 259 m. N. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. It is situate on the banks ofthe river Dunbeath, which here discharges itself into the German Ocean: and is an excellent Fish ing Station. The ancient Castle is situate on a narroAV neck ofland, impending on one side over the sea, and on the other, over a deep chasm, into Avhich the tide flows : It was taken and garrisoned by The Marquis of Montrose in 1650, immediately preceding his final defeat : it is now the seat of Mr. Sinclair. Near Dunbeath is an entire Picts' House, with the IioUoav in the top, and is called The Bourg of Dunbeath,. See, Latheron, and Ord, The. DUNBLANE, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Cathedral, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 32 bolls of meal, 16 bolls of bear, and \u00a361..13.4. in money, including \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements : the manse is in good repair : the glebe consists of 4\\ English acres : The Minister's Stipend was originally the Dean's living ; and, besides Avhat is paid from the Teinds of the Parish, consists of feu-duties paid from Dean's-Kier, in the Parish of Muthil ; from Dean's Lundie, and Dean's Town, in the Parish of Killmadock ; from Gogar, in the Parish of Logie ; from Craigam-Hall, in the Parish of Lecropt ; and of Teind duty from Logie-Almond, in the Parish of Monzie : Patron, The Crown : The Choir of the Cathedral is kept in repair, and used as the Parochial Church. It is in the Presbytery of Dunblane, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 2619, and, in 1811, was 2733. It is 41| m. W. N. W. from Edinburgh. A General Post- Office is established here. The Fairs are holden on the first Wednesday, O. S., in March, the last Tuesday in May, the 10th of August, O. S., and the 12th of November. It is pleasantly situate on the Eastern bank of the river Allan, over which there is a good bridge here. The See of Dunblane was founded by King"], [493, "DUN David the Second, about the year 1142: and he also built the Cathedral: Much of it is still standing, though fast falling to decay : under it are sepulchral vaults. This Church was once possessed of divers lands in England. The families of Keir, Stickling, Chisholm, Drummond, and Fenlayson, have separate places of burial here. There was anciently a Convent of Culdees here, which Avas continued even after the erection of the Bishoprick, by David the First. St. Blaan was Superior of this Convent in the reign of Kenneth the Third, and from him the See derived its same. Some walls and other re mains of the Bishop's Palace are still visible. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. In 1662, Dr. Robert Leighton was consecrated Bishop of Dunblane ; and, in 1669, was translated to the Archbishoprick of GlasgoAv, Avhere he con tinued till the year 1675 : besides his daily charities to the Poor, he settled a fund for some pious and public good work, in all the places where had interest and charge ; and, by his last will and testament, he bequeathed his valuable Library for the use ofthe Clergy ofthe Diocese of Dunblane, with funds for its support: since that time, it has received many additions, and is now a very valuable collection. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, a house, and garden, and 7 stones of cheese. There are other Schools also in different parts of the Parish, for the accom modation of those who reside at a distance from the town. The Parish of Dunblane is about 9 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth, The ground in general has a gradual declivity from the surrounding hills to the river Allan, which runs through the Parish, giving the name of Strath Allan to a considerable tract of land along its banks : upwards of one half of the Parish is muir-land, covered with heath, and SAvampy : the arable land is situate principally on the banks of the Allan, and ofthe small rivulet Ardocli, which runs along the Western border. Here is a great extent of natural Avood, and several plantations of fir. Game, of various kinds, are in great plenty. The climate is in general healthy. The roads, and bridges, are in good repair. Coals are the common fuel. There are several pits of excellent shell marl ; and lime is imported on the Forth, at an easy distance, At the foot ofthe Ochil Hills, a few miles North-East from the ToAvn, is Sheriff Muir, the scene of a bloody battle, sometimes called The Battle of Dunblane, which Avas fought in the month of November 1715, between the rebel forces under the command of The Earl of Marr, and the Royal army under The Duke of Argyle ; who, after a doubt ful victory, spared and permitted the Clans to disperse. Dunblane is a Scottish"], [494, "DUN Peerage, and <nves the title of Viscount to the Ancient and Illustrious family of Osborne, Duke of Leeds. DUNBOG, in the District of Cupar, and Shire of Fife : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was. \u00a3150., and \u00a38..6..8. for Communion ele ments : the manse is in tolerable order : the glebe consists of 4 acres of good land: Patron, The Crown: The Church was re-built in- 1810. It is in the Presbytery of Cupar, and Synod of Fife. The Resident Population ofthis Par ish, in 1801, was 232, and, in 1811, was 185. It is 3f m. E. from Newburgh. This Parish is about 3 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth : the greatest part of which is arable, and very productive in barley and wheat. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, and a rood ofland, and perquisites. DUNBUY, v. CRUDEN. DUNCAN-LAW, v. YESTER. DUNC AN'S-BAY, in the Shire of Caithness ; and in the Parisii of Canisbay. This is said to be the Berubium, of Ptolomey. It is situate in the Latitude of 58\u00b0 40' North, and the Longitude of 2\" 53' West from Greenwich. This beau tiful Promontory is of a circular shape, about 2 miles in circumference. The Head is every where covered with green to the very brink of the surrounding rock, with an intermixture of short heath. The situation is dry, and the air wholesome ToAvards the sea, which encompasses two-thirds of The Head, it is one continued precipice ; and, during the season of incubation, is frequented by innumerable flocks of sea-fowls. Near the top of the rock, and on that side which faces the Orkneys, is a vast gulph or cavern, called by the neighbouring inhabitants, The Glupe. On the highest part of The Head, are the remains of an ancient Watch-Tower. The prospect from hence is the most noble and ex tensi\\'e that can be imagined. DUNCOW, in the Shire of Dumfries ; and in the Parish of Kirk-Mahoe. This is an improving* Village, at the distance of 6 m. N. from Dumfries, DUNCRUIB, v. DUNNING. DUNDAFF, FOREST, v. NINIANS, ST. DUND ARGUE, v. ABERDOUR. DUNDAS, in the Shire of Linlithgow ; and in the Parish of Dalmenie. It is 2 m. N. W. from Kirk-Liston. The ancient family of Dundas, of Dundas, from which that of Arniston, and others, are derived, has been traced by Genea logists back to the Saxon Kings of England ; and that great Family has unin terruptedly enjoyed a large Estate in this Parish, in the male line, for nearly"], [495, "DUN 700 years. The present Proprietor is the Twenty-fourth in descent from the first Laird of Dundas ; and has in his possession one of the oldest original Writings in Scotland, being a Charter granted about the year 1120. The stately Castle ofthis respectable Family, erected on a lofty situation, still re mains, but is now uninhabited. DUNDAS-HILL, v. DALMENIE. DUNDEE, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Shire of Forfar : formerly a Rectory, and Vicarage, now served by Five Established Ministers, and two others who officiate in two Chapels of Ease ; besides a third Chapel, which is under the direction of The Church of Scotland, and belongs to a Congregation of Highlanders : Patrons, The Town Council : All these Churches, and Chapels, are considered as in one and the same Parish, and all their Ministers and Elders compose only one Kirk Session. It is in the Presbytery of Dundee, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Popu lation ofthis Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 26,084, and, in 1811, was 29,616. It is 40|- m. N. b. E. from Edinburgh. The Market is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the 15th of August, and 19th of September. A General Post- Office is established here. This is a large, and Avell-built Town, pleasantly situate on the Northern bank of the river Taj*, about twelve miles above its confluence with the German Ocean. The harbour, which is very commodious, is artificially protected by Piers, and furnished with a Quay ; it has 14 feet water at Spring tides. On the North shore, near the entrance ofthe \u00c6stuary, are two Light-Houses, very completely finished, and well attended, being the pro perty of The Fraternity of Seamen at Dundee. Although it was only erected into a Royal Borough by King William, it appears to have enjoyed many immuni ties and privileges previous to the reign of that Prince : but, as all the records and evidences of its ancient rights were either destroyed, or carried off by Ed ward the First of England, application was made to King Robert Bruce, who o-ranted the Town an infeftment and charter ; Avhich appears to have been con firmed and enlarged by successive Charters from many other Princes, and finallv confirmed by Tlte Great Charter from Charles the First, the articles of which were ratified by Parliament, on the 14tli of September, 1641. It is governed by a Provost, 4 Baillies, a Dean of Guild, a Treasurer, and 15 Coun sellors, who are annually self-elected. The Revenue ofthe Town is very con- siderable. Dundee is one of the Contributary Royal Boroughs with Perth, in sending one Member to Parliament. The Charitable Funds, under the manage-"], [496, "DUN ment of The Kirk-Session, are very extensive, and are most faithfully and humanely distributed : there are also many Friendly Societies ; and an Infirmary has lately been built, for the reception of Indigent Sick. A spirit for Literature and Education manifests itself here ; for, besides the Public Grammar School, and the English Schools, Avhich are well supplied with good Teachers, an Academy, or rather College, has been established, for mathematics, the French and Italian Languages, and the Polite Arts, with proper Professors in the different branches, and a large apparatus for natural and experimental Phi losophy. The principal manufacture is Linen, of various kinds, especially Osna burghs, sail-cloth, and coloured threads Avhich have long been in high repute. There are several Banks ; and also an Insurance Company against losses by fire, with a large Capital. The ancient name of Dundee was Alectum or Alec ; but the etymology of its present appellation is uncertain. It was formerly strongly fortified, and some remains of its ancient fortifications still remain at the Cowgate Port. It has sustained various attacks and sieges. It was twice taken by the English in the reign of King Edward the First, and as often retaken by the Heroes Wallace, and Bruce, the former of whom received his education in this Town ; and Avho demolished the old Castle, lest it should fall again into the hands of his enemies. The Town was afterwards taken and reduced to ashes by Richard the Second, and a fourth time by the English, who, in the reign of Edavard the Sixth, held Brough- Tay Castle. It suffered greatly, during the troubles of Charles the Second, and the Usurpation of Oliver Cromwell : but its last and most destructive siege was by General Monk, in 1651, when it was taken by assault, and completely pillaged. Here were Religious Houses of the Mathurines, the Dominicans and Franciscans ; and a Nunnery, whose name is barely mentioned by Keith. Dundee has given birth to many eminent literary characters ; among whom may be enumerated, the celebrated Hector Boethius or Boece ; Dr. Kinloch, Physician to James the Sixth, Mr. Gleg, Rector of the Grammar School, and Mr. Goldman, Merchant, whose Latin Poems, inserted in the Poetce Scotigence, are highly admired for their purity of language and elegance of composition ; \u2014 Fletcher, of Saltoun, Demester, of Dunnichen, the gallant Admiral Viscount Duncan, and the late Earl of Rosslyn (Lord Loughborough), are characters which would attach celebrity to any place, and their names will ever be grateful[y remembered by every Scotchman. By the influence of James Halyburton, who was one ofthe most early and able promoters of the Reformation, Dundee became the first Town in"], [497, "DUN Scotland, where the Reformed Religion Avas openly professed. Ship-building is said to be executed here with great ingenuity, and success. The point ofthe principal Pier is in the Latitude of 56&27' 23\" North, and the Longitude of 3\u00b0 2' 55\" West from Greemvich.\u2014 The Parish of Dundee is about 6 miles in length, and varies from one to four miles in breadth. The surface is uneA'en ; but, in many places, it is abundantly fertile, and well cultivated. The Estates of Logie, Blackness, and Balgay, are said to be in this Parish, only quoad sacra. Dud hope Castle, the Seat ofthe gallant Viscount Dundee, lies a little to the North ward of the Toavii. It had been the ancient Residence ofthe Scrymseours, Viscounts of Dudhope, and Earls of Dundee, Hereditary Constables of the Old Castle of Dundee, and Hereditary Standard-Bearers of Scotland, a Family, which became extinct in 1668. It fell at length to the Crown, and was granted by James the Seventh to the Viscount, then only Graham, of Claver-house ; on whose heroic death, at Killicrankie in 1690, it was given to The Marquis of Douglas, and still remains in that Illustrious House. DUNDHAIRDGHALL, v. KILL-MALIE. DUNDONALD, in the District of Kyle, and Shire of Ayr : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 100 bolls and 14 pecks of meal, 32 bolls and 11 pecks of bear, Ayrshire measure, and 20 merks Scotch, together with an augmentation of \u00a325.3. .2\\ Sterling, and \u00a38.. 6.. 8. Sterling for Com munion elements : the manse, and offices, were re-built upon a very neat plan, in 1784 : the glebe consists of 4 acres : Patron, The Earl of Eglintoun : The Church is in good condition. It is in the Presbytery of Ayr, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1240, and, in 1811, was 1610. It is 4m. S.W. from Killmarnock. This Parish is about 8 miles in length, stretching along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, which bounds it on the West. The surface, and soil, are various, in proportion to their contiguity to the Claven Hills, and Shoualton Moss, which divide the Parish almost into tAvo equal parts : the former being generally of a fertile clay, inclining in some places to loam, and consisting of gentle eminences, beautifully adorned with clumps and belts of planting : the latter being a Avide uncultivated plain, except near the Promontory of The Troone, where there is a great extent of arable, and good pasture land. Great improvements in agriculture have been made here by the indefatigable and patriotic exertions of Mr. Fairlie. Coals, and peat, are in abundance. Tlte Troone, which is the Western extre mity of the Parish, might be made an excellent Harbour ; and even in its natural vol. i. K"], [498, "DUN state, it affords safe anchorage from every quarter, except the North-West; it is much resorted to for the excellence of its sea-bathing, and also affords a lucra tive salmon fishery. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together Avith School-fees and perquisites, and a good dwelling, and garden. The Houses of Fullerton, belonging to Colonel Fullerton, \u2014 Fairlie, to Mr. Fairlie, \u2014 Hillhouse, to Mr. Mackerrel, \u2014 and Neu fie Id, to Major Craavfurd, are very commodious and elegant modern Mansions. Among the hills, are the ves tiges ofthe ancient Castle of Kemplaw. Opposite to the Village, on a beautiful bank clothed with Avood, stands the House of Auch ans, for a long time the resi dence ofthe Wallaces, of Dundonald; it afterwards passed into the Family of Cochran, and is now the property and residence of the Countess Dowager of Eglintoun : here are the remains of a small Orchard, Avhich was once in high repute ; and from whence the Pear, known in Scotland by the name of Auchans, derives its appellation. The ancient and royal Castle of Dundonald was the favourite seat of Robert the Second, the first King of Scotland ot the Stuart race : it is now in ruins, and its site, with five roods of land adjoining, are all the property in this Parish which now belongs to the Ancient and Noble Family of Cochran, to whom it gives the title of Earl.

It is 6 m. S. b. W. from Fochabers. In the North end ofthe Parish, stood The Chapel of Grace ; and near to it, the famous Well of that name, to which multitudes, even from the Western Isles, formerly resorted, and nothing short of violence could restrain their superstition. The School is not legal. The mortifications for the Poor, by several persons, are \u00a3240., three gardens, and three ridges of Land. It is situate on the Western bank of the river Spey. DUNFERMLIN, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the District of Dunfermlin, and Shire of Fife : formerly a Vicarage, the Benefice being served by two Ministers : the Stipend ofthe First Minister, in 1811, was 8 chalders of victual, one half payable in meal, and the other half in bear, and \u00a350.

Sterling for Communion elements: the glebe, which is arable, consists of 4 acres : Patron, The Crown : \u2014 The Stipend of the Second Minister was, 5 chalders of grain, viz., two of bear, two of meal, and one of oats, and \u00a371. Sterling; he has neither manse, nor glebe: Patron, The CroAvn : The Church is of great antiquity, being a part of that large and magni ficent edifice built by Malcolm Canmore, and in its structure is said to resemble the Cathedral at Durham : it is very capacious, but is cold, dirty, and badly fitted up. It is in the Presbytery of Dunfermlin, and Synod of Fife. The Resi dent Population ofthis Town, and Parish, (comprising the Town and Suburbs, and the neighbouring feus of Pittencrieff, and the Villages of Lime -Kilns, Charlestown, Crossford, Hallbeath, Crossgates, Mastertown, Patimuir, and Pit liver) was 9980, and, in 1811, was 11.649. It is \\5\\ m. N. W. from Edinburgh. The Markets are well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the third Wednesday, O. S., in January, the second Wednesday in March, the fourth Wednesday in April, the first Wednesday in July, the first Tuesday in August, the fourth Friday in September, the last Thursday in October, and the fourth Wednesday in November. A General Post-Office is established here. The greater part of the Town is pleasantly situate on an eminence, having a pretty bold declivity towards the Firth of Forth, from which it is three miles distant: the ground, however, soon flattens to the Nether- Town, which stands upon a plain : the prospect from the ToAvn is remarkably beautiful, and extensive. The Streets are well built, and the size of the Town has rapidly increased since the feuing of a great part of the estate of Pittencrieff, which now forms a large Suburb, con nected with the Town by a Bridge of one arch, 297 feet in length ; and which was built, in 1770, at the sole expense of the late George Chalmers, Esq. The Borough, it appears, held ofthe Monastery of Dunfermlin for nearly two centu ries ; and became Royal by a Charter from King James the Sixth, dated the 24th of May, 1588. The government ofthe Town is vested in a Provost 2 Bail lies, a Dean of Guild, and 18 Counsellors, who are annually elected. Its Revenue is very considerable. Dunfermlin is one of the Contributary Royal Boroughs with Stirling, in sending one Member to Parliament. It has long been distin guished for the manufacture of diaper or table linen. Water is conveyed in pipes from about 2 miles distance from several fountains, which are extremely abundant. Coals, of excellent quality, are in great plenty ; and the Burgesses have the pri vilege of being served with them from a Pit belonging to the Town at a cheaper rate, than what they are sold to the country at large. The Charitable Institutions 3K2"], [500, "DUN of St. Leonard's Hospital, Graham's and Reid's Mortifications, are extensively useful, and honourably conducted. The Salary of the Rector ofthe Grammar School, arising from Queen Anne's mortification, and the voluntary contribution of the ToAvn, is \u00a325. Sterling: he is presented, on the recommendation of the ToAvn-Council, by The Marquis of Tweeddale, as Heritable Baillie of Rega lity : \u2014 the Doctor or Usher, is elected by the Town-Council and Kirk-Session, with a Salary of \u00a312. .7. .6. Sterling: \u2014 The Master of the Song, an Office insti tuted by Queen Anne, is presented by The Marquis of Tweeddale, on the recommendation of the ToAvn-Council, who, besides certain perquisites, and School-fees, has a Salary of \u00a35. Sterling. At an early period Dunfermlin became a Royal residence : Malcolm Canmore usually resided at a Castle, erected on a peninsulated Hill, in a valley niar the ToAvn ; some small remains of Avhich are still visible in the gardens at Pittencrieff. A Palace was afterwards built, not far from this Tower, in a most romantic situation ; which, falling to decay, was re-built by Anne, of Denmark ; it is also now quite in ruins, but the South- West wall still remains, a monument of the magnificent fabric, of which it was a part, and tradition continues to point out the chimney of the apartment where that unfortunate Monarch Charles the First was born. The Monastery Avas one ofthe most ancient and celebrated in Scotland, being founded by Malcolm Canmore for Monks of the Benedictine Order, and completed by his Son Alexander the First, surnamed The Fierce: the Church and Monastery were dedicated to The Holy Trinity, and St. Margaret, the Founder's Queen. It con tinued to be governed by a Prior, until the reign of David the First, who raised it to the Dignity of an Abbey ; and, in 1 124, translated thither 13 monks from Canterbury. This Abbey was richly endowed, and derived its revenue from very distant parts of the Kingdom : it was a magnificent, and extensive building, but fell an early sacrifice to the plundering army of Edward the First, in 1303 ; all that was saved of this fine fabric was the Church, with a few Cells for tbe monks ; these Avere demolished at the Reformation in 1560, and the ruins of the Abbey are now inconsiderable : the window of the Fratery is much admired, for its size and beauty. At the general Dissolution of the Monasteries, Dunfermlin was first given to Secretary Pitcairn, then to the Master of Gray, and after wards was conferred upon Alexander Seton, a younger son of George Lord Seton, who was at first advanced to the honour ofa Peer ofthe Realm, by the title of Lord Urquhart, on the 3d of August 1591 ; and, on the 3d of March 1605, was created Earl of Dunfermlin, which title was forfeited in 1690. In"], [501, "DUN 1593, the Abbey was erected into a Temporal Lordship, and bestowed on Queen Anne of Denmark, the consort of James the Sixth : this Lordship included all the lands which belonged to the Monastery on this side ofthe Firth of Forth, ex cept the Barony of Burnt-Island and New Birne, in which Sir Robert Melville, of Murdochamy, and Wood, of Largo, were enfeoffed. Musselburgh, which also belonged to this Monastery, was erected into a Temporal Lordship, and given to Lord Chancellor Thirlestone ; and it was excepted from the general annexation in 1587. In 1641, Charles the First granted a lease ofthe Lord ship of Dunfermlin for three 19 years, to Charles Seton, Earl of Dunfermlin. To this lease The Marquis of Tweeddale obtained a right in payment of a debt due to him by The Earl of Dunfermlin, and afterwards got the lease renewed in his own name. The last grant to the Tweeddale family having expired in 1780, The Countess of Rothes, Lord Elgin, and others, obtained a tack of the Teinds ofthe Lordship, for the interest of the heritors of the Parish, on the annual payment of \u00a3100. Sterling. This Abbey was a celebrated Burial-place; and here the Founder, his Queen, and seven other Scottish Monarchs lie interred. Mr. Grose has preserved three Views of it. The Parish of Dunfermlin is about 8 miles in length, and 5 miles in breadth. The surface slopes gradually to the sea ; the soil varying from a gravel to a rich loam towards the coast which is partly flat, and partly high and rocky : but many places are in an excellent state of cultivation. The Climate is salubrious. Several considerable plantations have lately been made here. It is watered by the small river Lyne. There are prodigious Quarries of lime-stone, free-stone, and granite, all of an excellent quality : iron-stone is also abundant, and exported in great quantities to the Carron Company, DUN-FLO, v. SLEAT. DUN-GAVEL, v. WISTON. DUNGISBAY, v. DUNCANS-BAY. DUNGLASS, v. OLDHAMSTOCKS DUNGLASS, in the Shire of Dumbarton ; and in the Parisii of Old Kill- Patrick. It is 2\\ m. S E. b. E. from Dumbarton. The great Roman Wall, commonly called Graham's Dyke, between the Forth and the Clyde, terminated here. The Castle, which is situate on a Promontory above the Clyde, was once a Roman station ; and, in the time of Oliver Cromwell, was a place of considerable strength. It was blown up in the year 1640, by the desperate treachery of an English boy, Page to The Earl of Hadington, who, with many"], [502, "DUN persons of high rank, Avere miserably destroyed. It was formerly the property of the Colquhouns, of huss, Avho likewise enjoyed the whole tract of country from thence to Dumbarton, and it retains their name at present, being called The Barony of Colquhoun. This Castle and Barony have, however, for many years, been in the possession ofthe Family of Sir Archibald Edmonstone, Bart., and his vassals. But, although the Family of Luss have now no property in the Parish of Old Kill-Patrick, they have still very large Estates in the County of Dumbarton. The massacre ofthe Colquhouns by the Macgregors, in 1602, is an instance, among many, of the barbarous state ofthis country at that time, and occasioned Acts of Parliament prohibiting any person from using the name of Macgregor ; but which have since very wisely been repealed. DUN, HOUSE, v. MONTROSE, and DUN. DUNIAN, i. e. JOHN'S HILL, in the District of Jedburgh, and Shire of Roxburgh ; in the Parish of Bedrule. This is the most remarkable Hill in the neighbourhood of Bedrule, its elevation being 1031 feet above the level ofthe sea ; and, from its peculiar situation, it is almost every where seen from beyond Avhere the waters begin to descend to the Western shores of the Island, to the utmost boundary of the Eastern coast. DUN1BRISTLE, v. DALGETY. DUNIKIER, v. PATH-HEAD. DUNIPACE, in the Shire of Stirling : formerly a Chapelry, now annexed to the Chapelry of Larbert: The Church is in decent repair. It is in the Pres bytery of Stirling, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 948, and, in 1811, was For the Village of DenoA'an . . 220 For the Village of Dunipace . . 61 For the Village of Milton . . 653 For the Village of Torr- Wood . 165 1099 It is 4 m. W. b. N. from Falkirk. This Parish abounds with coal, and free stone. Here are two extensive Print-fields, and also a Cotton-spinning Manu factory. Near the Church are two large artificial Mounts, from which the Parioh is supposed to haxe derived its name ; these were the Dunes Pacis, or The Hills of Peace, and are said to have been raised as a Memorial of a Peace concluded there between the Romans and the Caledonians. Here also is the"], [503, "DUN famous Torr- Wood, where Sir William Wallace retired after the fatal battle of Falkirk ; and the remains of the hollow tree (an oak) are still pointed out, Avith great veneration, where the hero secreted himself, and is called Wallace's Tree. Adjoining to this is a square Field, inclosed by a ditch, where Mr. Donald Cargill excommunicated King Charles the Second. The Salary ofthe Paro chial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with perquisites, and School-fees. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. There are three Heritors in this Parish, each of whom have elegant Seats ; and who, from their general Philan thropy and indefatigable exertions for the public good, are highly and justly respected ; these are Mr. Morehead, of Herbert- Shire, Mr. Johnston, of Denovan, and Mr. Spottiswood, of Dunipace. This Parish derives a great advantage from its vicinity to The Grand Forth and Clyde Canal, which unites the Eastern and AVestern Seas. DUNKELD, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Cathedral, with the Parish of Dowally annexed ; the Stipend of which, in 181-1, was \u00a326.. 6. .8. in money, and 45 bolls 3 firlots and 2 pecks of oat-meal, and 22 bolls 1 firlot and 3^ pecks of barley, payable by the Heritors of Meigle ; besides which, the Minister is entitled to \u00a313. Sterling yearly, as one-third of the Deanery duties of the Cathedral of Dunkeld, granted, in 1744, to the Ministers of Aber-Nyte, Dunkeld, and Liff ; but, ofthis sum, he receives no more than \u00a38..14..0., as some of the lands, from which the duties should be drawn, cannot be traced ; of Feu-duties in Dunkeld, he receives 3*.. 4c.., and of use and wont contribution from Dowally \u00a38.. 6.. 8. : there is neither manse, glebe, nor allowance for Communion elements : Patron, The Duke of Athol : The Choir of the Cathedral is now converted into the Parish Church, and forms a decent, and not incommodious place of Wor ship, though exceedingly cold in winter. It is in the Presbytery of Dunkeld, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this City, and Parish, in 1801, was 1185, and, in 1811, Avas 1360. It is 55 wi. N. b. W* from Edinburgh. The Market is on Saturday, and is Avell supplied. The Fairs are holden on the 1st of January, and Candlemas day, chiefly for the sale of yarn; on the 25th of March, for yarn and horses ; on the 9th of June {St. Columba' s day), for coarse cloths and other goods : on Hallow-day, for black cattle, sheep, and goats ; and, on the 8th of December, for yarn : At these Fairs, a Guard, who is paid by The Duke of Athol, and provided with arms, is always in readi ness to preserve the peace, and apprehend any offenders who may be detected. This City is pleasantly situate on the Northern bank ofthe river Tay ; and the"], [504, "DUN scenery with which it is surrounded, has long been the subject of admiration, as romantic and beautiful. Nature has been liberal in producing and combining fine objects in the landscape ; and the improvements of The Duke of Athol, conducted on an extensive scale, and with great taste and judgement, have given an additional ornament to the whole. It is a place of great antiquity, and was the Capital of Ancient Caledonia : About the dawn of Christianity, in 729, Constantine the Third, King of the Picts, is said to have founded here a Monastery of Culdees, in honour of St. Columba ; which that pious Prince, David the First, about the year 1 127, converted into a Bishoprick, and ranked it the first in Scotland. It is a Burgh of Barony, and its only Magistrate is a Baron Baillie, appointed by The Duke of Athol, who is Superior. Charles the Second offered it a Charter of erection into a Royal Borough, but the offer Avas wisely declined. A General Post-Office is established here. The principal manufac- ture is linen, and yarn. Fuel is expensive. The climate is healthy ; and it is much frequented in summer by Invalids, who resort hither for the benefit of drinking goats' milk and Avhey, The salary of the Grammar School, which is ably conducted, is about \u00a334. Sterling per annum, including the dues payable to the Chaplain of St. Ninian, of which a grant Avas obtained; these consist of 20 merks Scotch, two bolls of coals, and tAvo dozen of poultry; and part of them ought to be paid by lands at Aberlady, and what Avas formerly the Bishop's lodging in Perth : the master has also a dAvelling-house officially, together with School-fees, and perquisites ; and the amount of an annual examination of the Scholars in the Church, when the Inhabitants attend, and a pecuniary donation is made by the Scholars to the Master, as a token of the approbation of the Parents. Here are also a flourishing Sunday School, and a Female School, both of them instituted by the benevolence and piety of the late Jane, Duchess of Athol Here is a very ancient Institution, called The Chapmen Society ; its original Charter was from James the Fifth of Scotland, and it was renewed by James Duke of Athol, as High Sheriff of the County, about the year 1730 : an annual General Meeting is holden alternately at Dunkeld, and Cupar of Angus. Tliere are also some Societies here, which have been established for the benefit ofthe Poor^and of which the good effects are extensively felt. The boundaries of Dunkeld, when viewed as a Parish, are not extensive, but they are not hitherto distinctly ascertained. As it was the Seat ofthe Bishop, and the Service ofthe Cathedral was performed eitner by his Chaplain, or by some ofthe Clergy who had fixed benefices in other quarters ofthe Diocese, it was not necessary, at that"], [505, "DUN time, to constitute it formally a Parish, and to mark its limits. In fact, it does not appear that this was ever done. It is not entered as a Parish in the Cess- Books ofthe County, and none ofthe old Title deeds ofthe Proprietors describe the property as lying within the Parish, but Avithin the City, of Dunkeld. What is now therefore the Parish, includes only what was formerly within the Boun daries of the City. These, in the course of time, have been considerably altered ; for, during the commotions in 1689, the greatest part of the houses were burned by an irritated and licentious soldiery, and such of them as had stood to the West and North- West of the Cathedral, were not re-built. The ground which these houses occupied, and the gardens that had been intermixed with them, is supposed to have extended to about five acres, and this space now forms a part of The Duke of Athol's fine lawn and policy. But, as the Boun daries of the Town receded on one quarter, they stretched out on another : and several new houses were built on the slope ofthe eminence, Avhich rises to the Eastward of the City. These are uniformly described in the Title-deeds, as lying in the Parish of Caputh : that Parish indeed completely surrounds Dun keld, except where it is skirted on the South by the Tay, and in former times had reached, as it thus appears, close to the site of the buildings : and Stipend is still paid to the Minister of Caputh, from a piece of ground, lying but a few yards from the Cathedral. Dunkeld being then the residence of the Bishop, and hence ofthe dignified Clergy, most ofthe lands around it belonged to them, and had several peculiar privileges; which have, of course, de scended to those who purchased the lands : they are thirled to no mill ; they pay no custom ; and there is a right of commonty attached to them, in an extensive hill which lies to the Northward of The Duke of Athol's demesne. Very extensive plantations have lately been made in the neighbourhood. In 1645, Sir James Galloway, Master of Requests to James the Sixth and Charles the First, was erected Baron Dunkeld ; his Grandson James was attainted in 1690, and dying in the beginning of the last Century, the title became extinct. The Cathedral, which is now much dilapidated, has once been an elegant build ing: on the North side of the Choir, is the Chapter-House, built by Bishop Lauder in 1469, the vault of which is now used as the Burying-place of the Ancient and Illustrious Family of Murray, Duke of Athol. In the month of July, 1803, The Duke of Athol presented a Memorial to The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, respecting a Bridge over the river Tay at Dun keld : by which it appeared, that His Grace had obtained an Act of Parliament vol. I. 3 L"], [506, "DUN for building a Bridge in this situation, and for making the necessary approaches to it, by imposing a certain Toll or Pontage : and, upon a full consideration of the special circumstances stated in His Grace's Memorial, The Commissioners expressed their readiness to contribute one-half of the expense of building this Bridge, after deducting from the total expense thereof such sum as might be raised on the intended Toll or Pontage. Having receiA-ed a fovourable ansAver to this overture, The Commissioners explained themselves more particularly to Hrs Grace, who thereupon judged it convenient to transact the business per- sonally with the Board ; and with his concurrence a Minute Avas made to the following effect, on the 14th of May, 1804 : \u2014 \" The Commissioners approve of the Bridge to be built at Dunkeld for the sum of \u00a315,000 (as estimated upon Oath by Mr. Telford) ; and understanding that the sum of \u00a37000. may be raised on the intended Toll or Pontage, they agree to place a Moiety ofthe re- maining sum of \u00a38000. to the account of the said Bridge (as directed by the Act) so soon as The Duke of Athol shall have deposited Bills with the Bank of Scotland to the amount of \u00a311,000: His Grace thus paying a Moiety ofthe sum of \u00a38000., and also making himself ansAverable for the further sum of \u00a37000. to be reimbursed to him afterwards by the intended Toll : And The Commissioners will moreover defray a Moiety ofthe expense of making Roads of approach to the said Bridge (including a Bridge over the river Bran), when the same shall have been estimated upon Oath, and His Grace shall have deposited Bills with the Bank of Scotland to the amount of the other Moiety of the expense.\" The operations were accordingly commenced, and in the month of October 1808, the Bridge Avas opened for passengers. The extent and grandeur of this Bridge render it a National ornament, and its utility is not disproportionate, the Ferries over the Tay at Dunkeld having been occasionally dangerous and even impas- sable, and at all times very inconvenient to persons travelling to and from the Central Highlands : the middle arch of this magnificent Bridge is 90 feet wide, the two next arches 84 feet each, and the two next 74, with two land arches 25 feet Avide each : the Water-way being 446 feet. DUNKELD, LITTLE, in the Shire of Prrth : formerly a Vicarage, with the Chapel of Lagan- Aul achy united; the Stipend of which, in 1811,Avas\u00a3'70..19..1i Sterling, to be converted into victual, \u00a38. .6.. 8. for Communion elements, 72 bolls of meal, and 56 bolls of barley : the manse is in tolerable repair : the glebe consists of about 8 Scotch acres : Patron, The Crown : The Church is beautifully situate near the great Highland Road, leading from Perth to Inverness by the"], [507, "DUN Ferry of Invar. It is in the Presbytery of Dunkeld, and Syriod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of the United Parishes, in 1801, was 2977, and, in 1811, Avas 2982. It is \\ m. S. from Dunkeld. This Parish contains about 31,000 Scotch acres ; comprehending, First, the District of Murthly, which extends from the neighbouring Parish of Kinclaven on the East to a small village called Invar, about a quarter ofa mile West from the Church ; the surface is varied and beautiful ; the soil is light, and fertile, and is generally inclosed, and well cultivated : in this District are Murthly House, the residence ofthe Steavarts, of Grandtully ; and Birnam Hill, rendered classic ground by the magic pen of Shakespear : It was anciently a Forest, and a part of the Royal domain of Scotland : As I did stand my watch upon the hill, I look'd toAvard Birnam, and anon, methought The ivood began to move ! Secondly, a District that extends from Iiwar for about 10 miles along the banks of the Tay to Grandtully ; the greater part of Avhich having* once been the property of the See of Dunkeld, is called Tlte Bishoprick, and under that name the Avhole district is known ; the cultivated lands form the South side of the Tay ; the fields are level, and the new system of agricul- ture has given the whole the appearance of an almost continued series of beautiful gardens, from one extremity to the other : \u2014 and, Thirdly, The Dis- trict of Strath-Bran, Avhich is separated from The Bishoprick by a large tract of hilly ground of considerable extent and elevation, and extending 9 miles Westward, from Invar to Amulrie : this valley contains several villages, and the soil is generally of a fertile loam, Avatered by the river Bran which Avinds through its Avhole length, and falls into the Tay near the City of Dunkeld. The climate is healthy. Near Murthly, is an inexhaustible quarry of fine free-stone ; and in the Hill of Birnam, is abundance of excellent slate. The natural Woods, and Plantations, are very extensive. In the district of Strath-Bran, axe three Lochs, well stocked with trout, of a superior flavour. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees. And the Society for propaga ting Christian Knowledge have very judiciously established two of their Schools here. Peats are in abundance. The great Military road, from Perth to Inver ness, passes through the Parish, and affords good accommodation at the Inns of Invar, and Amulrie. See, Grandtully, and Strath- Bran. DUNLAPPIE, in the Shire of Forfar : an ancient Rectory, now compre hended in the Parish of Strickathrow. 3L2"], [508, "DUN DUNLICHTY, or DUN LE CHATTI, i. e. The Hill which bisects the Territory ofthe CATTI, inthe Shire of Inverness : formerly a Rectory, united to the Parish of Daviot : The Church Avas built in 1759, and has since been repaired. Divine Sen ice is performed here every other Sunday. It is in the Presbytery of Inverness, and Synod of Moray. Aber Arder, and Farr, are Seats of the families of Mackintosh, Avho have greatly increased the value of their estates by extensive plantations, and other improvements. See, Daviot. DUNLOP, in the District of Cuninghame, and Shire of Ayr; formerly a Vicarage, belonging to the Monastery of Killwinning ; the Stipend of Avhich, in 1811. Avas \u00a3150. : the manse is in tolerable repair : the glebe consists of more than thc legal extent: Patron, The Earl of Eglintoun : The Church is in good condition. It is in the Presbytery of Irvine, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 808, and, in 1811, was 990. It is 2\\ m. N. N. W. from SteAvarton. This Parish is about 7 miles in length, and 2~ miles in breadth. The surface, though hilly, is of easy access, and is well adapted to the purposes of agriculture and pasture : the greater part is inclosed, and highly cult_A*ated. It is particularly famous for its cheese. The roads are in good repair. The emoluments of the School are about \u00a319. per annum, together Avith an excellent School-house. DUNMAGLAS, in the Shire of Nairn, though locally situate in the Shire of Inverness ; and in the Parish of Dunlichty. It is 19 m. NE. b. E. from Fort Augustus. Here is the Seat of the ancient family of Mac Gillivray, Chief of the poAverful Clan of that name. This Estate, according to Mr. Nimmo, be longed to the Thanes of Calder, when one of them procured an Act of the Scots Parliament, in the year 1405, incorporating all his lands in the Shires of Inverness and Forres, into the Shire of Nairn : and, accordingly, Dunmaglas forms still a part of that County. It is indeed under the Jurisdiction of the She riff of Inverness, by the Act of 1748, and in the Acts respecting the Statute Labour, and since then in that Act for making Roads and building Bridges, it has been found convenient to exchange it with Nairn, for the Estate of Budzeat, near Calder Castle. Dunmaglas is situate among, and comprehends the whole ofthe sources ofthe river Farigag, in Strath Errick, above Abershea. The Boundary being the \" weather shear,\" or summit level between these sources and those of Loin or Aber Calder on the West, and Faraline on the North-West, both of Avhich run to Feachlin or Fyers ; those of Findhorn on the South, from which it is divided by the summit of the hill of Dochsivine, and those of Nairn on the"], [509, "DUN East, from which, after running nearly parallel to the Farigag, and about half a mile from it, the Outline crosses this river at the junction of the little burn of Dalscott, about half a mile above Abershea; turn then South-West by a little stream towards Aber Calder, keeping the summit level on the South of the burn of Faraline as aforesaid. The whole is in the form of an oblique paralle logram, of which the longer diagonal runs North and South about 7 hiiles ; the extent being about 16 square miles. See, Budzeat. DUN-MONAIDH, v. EDINBURGH. DUNMORE, or ELPHINSTONE, in the Shire of Stirling ; and in the Parish of Airth. It is 8 m. S. E. from Stirling. This Village is situate upon the Forth, and is within the Jurisdiction ofthe Port of Alloa. In the year 1809, the Coal Works here were given up; when upAvards of Thirty families removed from the Parish. The Castle of Dunmore is the ancient Seat of the Illustrious Family of Murray, and from whence they derive their title of Earl. The first Earl of Dunmore was Lord Charles Murray, second Son of John, Marquis of Athol, and of Lady Amelia Stanley, by whom The Sovereignty of The Isle of Man, and the Barony of Strange, came into the Athol family. His Lordship was the sixth in descent from Mary, Queen Dowager of France, the beautiful daughter of Henry the Seventh, through the Earls of Derby, Lords of Man, and the Clifforos, Earls of Cumberland. By his Great Grandmother, Charlotte, of Orange Nassau, whose Mother was a Princess of the House of Bourbon, His Lordship was nearly related to several of the Crowned Heads of Europe. See, Airth, and Dunoon. DUNMORE, HILL, v. MONZIE. DUN-NAOMHAIG, CASTLE, v. KILLD ALTON DUNNET, in the Shire of Caithness: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, including the glebe, was upwards of \u00a3150. Sterling : the manse, and offices, are in bad condition : Patron, Sir John Sinclair, Bart., of Ulbster : The Church is an ancient building, but it is neither commodious, nor in good repair. It is in the Presbytery of Caithness, and Synod of Caithness and Suther land. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1366, and, in 1811, was 1398. It is 8 m. N E. b. E. from Thurso. This Parish is about 10 miles in length, and about 4 miles in breadth at the middle, but is much nar rower towards the extremities, and is one of the most Northern Parishes in Scotland. The soil is in general light, with little clay or deep loam ; by far the greater part being uncultivated, and, indeed, incapable of culture. The climate"], [510, "DUN is healthy. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, and perquisites. The Society for propagating Christian Knowledge have a Spinning School here ; and, in the remote parts of the Parish, there arc tAvo or three private Schools. The only language taught, and spoken is English. Dunnet Head is an exten- sive Promontory, running into the Pentland Firth on the Western border ofthe Parish : it'consists of several hills, interspersed with vallies, in which is a great extent of fine pasture for small cattle and sheep : through its whole extent, Avhich is not less than 9 miles, it presents a front of broken rocks to the sea, from 100 to 400 feet high ; it is joined to the rest of the Parish by an isthmus of Ioav land, of about two miles in breadth : no part of it is inhabited; and the soil is chiefly moss, running on free-stone or sandy clay : a great variety of sea- fowls frequent these rocks, and especially the Layer or Puffin, during the season of incubation. That part of the Parish to the East of Dunnet Head, along the Pentland Firth, has a low rocky shore, which, on an average, mayproduce about 20 tons of kelp annually. Three Lakes, each about a mile in length, and halfasmuchin breadth, supply the principal mills with Avater. The current in the Pentland Firth is so exceedingly strong here during Spring tides, that no vessel can stem it ; the flood tide runs, from West to East, at the rate of 10 miles an hour, with New and Full moon : it is then high water at Scarf-Skerry at nine o'Clock, from whenee the Ferry-boat crosses from Dunnet to the Ork- neys ; immediately as the water begins to fall upon the shore, the current turns to the West : but the strength ofthe flood is so great in the middle ofthe Firth, that it continues to run East till about twelve : these contiguous currents, running Avith amazing velocity, in opposite directions, have a strange appearance from the land, in a day fovourable for observing them. Though Dunnet Bay runs far into the land, it affords no shelter for any vessel upon the North side of it, which is contiguous to Dunnet Head, as it is exposed to the West : but, on the Pentland Firth, to the East ofthe Head, there are several very secure Havens for boats or small craft. The Haven of Brough, close by the Head, is well shel- tered from every Avind but the North-West, and a small expense, by throwino* out a pier, might render it secure against the wind from that quarter : the entrance to it is about three fathoms deep at Ioav water, and Avithout any bar ; and, as it is contiguous to the best fishing ground for cod and ling, it is not only capable of being rendered a safe harbour, but the most commodious fishing sta tion in the Parish, or even on this side of the Pentland Firth. The Harbour of Ham -or Holm is scarcely a mile to the East of Brough : it might also be"], [511, "DUN rendered safe for small vessels, at little expense : a superficial Pier is erected there already, and vessels of 100 tons find no inconvenience in loading or unload ing in the summer: it has, however, the disadvantage ofa bar or ridge of sand and gravel, across its entrance, upon which there is not sufficient depth of water for vessels of great burden, except with Spring tides. Scarf-Skerry is a narrow Creek between two rocks, and affords a convenient landing for boats with mode rate Aveather, but is not capable of being much improved. The Parish belongs to three Heritors ; two of whom reside occasionally in it. The Northerly Avinds have covered a great part of this Parish with sand. Upon Dunnet Head are the ruins ofthe Cell ofa Hermit. Ratter is the Seat of The Earl of Caithness. DUNNICHEN, v. CRIECH. DUNNICHEN, in the Shire of Forfar : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of Avhich, in 1811, Avas \u00a3150., together with \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements, and a glebe of 4 acres of arable, and 2 acres of grass land : the manse is in de cent repair: Patron, The CroAvn : The Church, Avhich is small and old, was dedicated to St. Causnan. It is in the Presbytery of Forfar, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Villages of Drimmitormont, and Letham) was 1049, and, in 1811, was 1233. It is 3|- m. S. E. from Forfar. An old established Toy Fair is annually holden here, on the second Wednesday of March. O. S. This Parish, consisting ofthe Estates of Dunnichen, Dunbarrow, and Tullows, contains about 3200 Scotch acres. The soil is, in general, fertile, and Avell cultivated ; but the seasons are late, on account of its elevation. A great quantity of coarse linen is manufac tured here. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, a house, School-house, and kitchen-garden. The climate is re markably healthy. It abounds with excellent free-stone, and shell-marl. The public roads are in good repair. Dunnichen House is the residence of George Dempster, Esq., who is the principal Proprietor, and Avhose honest and patri otic conduct as a Statesman will ever be remembered by his country. DUNNINALD, in the Shire of Forfar; and in the Parish of Craig. Itis 2 m. S. b.W. from Montrose. The Estate of Dunninald, distinct from Usan, and Scot's- Town, is about 560 acres ; it formerly belonged to David Scot, Esq., but is now the property of David Arkley, Esq. : the Mansion is a poor old building, scarcely habitable. DUNNING, in the Shire of Perth: formerly a Chapelry, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 4 chalders of victual, and 1000 merks in money : the manse"], [512, "DUN is in tolerable repair : the glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Pa tron, The Earl of Kinnoul: The Church, which is in decent condition, was anciently the Chapel of St. Serf It is in the Presbytery of Auchterarder, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Villages of Dunning, and Ncav Pitcaim or Dragon's Den) Avas 1504, and, in 1811, was 1723. It is 5 m. E. N. E. from Auchterarder. This Parish is situate at the Northern extremity ofthe Ochil Hills, where they termi nate in Strath-Earn: the high and muir-land parts are appropriated to the pas turage of sheep ; but, in the loAver grounds, the soil is tolerably fertile, and con siderable improvements in agriculture have lately been made here. The climate is cold, and stormy. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees ; and it is well conducted, and attended. Coals are the general fuel. The only manufacture here is that of coarse linen. Duncruib, the property and residence ofthe Ancient and Noble family of Rollo, holds a distinguished place in this Parish ; this Estate was a grant to the family of Rollo, by David Earl of Strathearn, with the consent of King Robert his father, the charter bearing date the 13th of February 1380; in 1512, it was erected into a free Barony; and, in 1651, Sir Andrew Rollo, Knt., was raised to the dignity of Baron Rollo, of Duncruib, by King Charles the Second. The House of Keltie, the property of the Drummonds, of Keltie, is an ancient edifice, and has been long and deservedly famed for the genuine hospitality of an open and generous hearted Family. The Village of Dunning was burned by a cruel command of The Pretender, in the month of January 1716. The Fairs are holden on the fourth Tuesday in May, the 20th of June, and 24th of October. A General Post- Office is established here. DUN-O-DEER, HILL, v. INCH. DUN of DORNADILLA, v. DURNESS. DUNOLLY, CASTLE, v. KERERA, ISLAND. DUNOON, in the District of Cowal, and Shire of Argyle; formerly a Vic arage, with the Parish of Killmun united ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., and \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements: the manse, which formerly stood in the Village, has been removed to a pleasant situation upon the glebe, com manding a fine view of the Firth of Clyde, and the opposite coast of the Shire of Renfrew ; and is now, perhaps, the best manse in the Shire of Argyle : the glebe consists of about 10 acres, and a garden: Patron, she Duke of Argyle: The Church is in bad condition. It is in the Presbytery of Dunoon, and Synod of"], [513, "DUN of Argyle. The Resident Population ofthe United Parishes, in 1801, was 1750, and, in 1811, was 2130. It is 7\\ m. W. b. S. from Greenock. The extent of these Parishes is about 24 miles in length, stretching along the Western coast ofthe Firth of Clyde, and Loch Long, which separates between the Parish of Killmun and the Peninsula of Roseneath, in the Shire of Dumbarton. The breadth ofthe inhabited part is very narrow, skirting the shores of the Firth of Clyde, the Holy Loch, and Loch Long. There are also some narrow glens, which are thinly inhabited. Glen-Finnart, the most Northern part of the Parish of Killmun, is now the property of The Earl of Dunmore, where His Lordship has a most delightful, sequestered Residence, and is making considerable im provements there. The Hills, in this District, are in general sloping, but in some parts bold and precipitous, and covered with natural wood. The soil is light and sandy, but tolerably productive. The climate is very rainy. The Gaelic is the prevailing language. Coals are becoming the general fuel. This Village was the residence of The Bishops of Argyle, during the last period of Episcopacy in Scotland, instead ofthe Island of Lismore. It has a Post three times in the week from Greenock ; and the Fairs are holden on the second Wednesdays, O. S., in January, February, August, and October. The Ferry is now much frequented, since the road across the country to the Ferry of Ottar has been finished. The Roads, and Bridges, in the Parish of Dunoon, are., in general, in good condition. But the Road, from Glen-Finnart to the Church of Killmun, is still in a state of nature. The Castle of Dunoon, which is now in ruins, was possessed by the English in 1334, but was taken in behalf of David Bruce, by Sir Colin Campbell, of Lochow, who put the garrison to the sword : in reward he was made Hereditary Constable, and had the grant of certain lands towards its support, which are still inherent in the Illustrious Family of Argyle. DUNOTTAR, in the Shire of Kincardine : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was about \u00a3115. Sterling, including the glebe: the manse was built in 1786 : Patron, The Crown : The Church was re-built in 1782. It is in the Presbytery of Fordoun, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resi dent Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (including the Town of Stonehaven) was 1975, and, in 1811, was 1886. It is 1 m. W. from Stonehaven. This Parish is divided almost into two equal parts by a valley, which takes its origin at the North East angle, and, Avidening as it reaches the Southern boundary, gives the beginning to the great Hoiv or Hollow of The Mearns, which alse vol. i. 3 M"], [514, "DUN extends through the Shire of Angus, under the name of Strathmore. It contains 6418 Scotch acres ; of Avhich, about 3600 are arable, the rest being green pasture and moor. The surface is uneven, and the greatest part of the land is unin- closed. The climate is healthy. The coast is very bold, consisting of plum- pudding rock, and containing several deep caves : the most remarkable part of it is called Fowl's Heugh, which is frequented by various aquatic birds, during the season of incubation ; and a rent of \u00a32.. 10.. 0. is paid to the Proprietor, for the liberty of catching them. The Roads are bad. Dunottai* Castle is situate on a high rock projecting into the German Ocean, accessible from the land on the West side, and that only by a narrow, steep, and Avinding path, over a deep gully, by which it is connected with the Main-land, and Avhich serves as a kind of natural fosse or ditch : on this rock, notwithstanding its difficulty of access, the Church and burial-place of the Parish were originally situate : the building, now called The Chapel, being formerly the Parish Church. During the contention betAveen the parties of Bruce and Baliol, the natural strength of this rock induced Sir William Keith, the Great Marischal of Scotland, to build a Castle upon it, as a place of safety for himself, and friends, during those turbu- lent times : and in whose family it continued, until the forfeiture of the late Earl, in 1715. In this Castle, during Cromwell's Usurpation, the Regalia of Scot- land, consisting ofthe Crown, SAvord, and Sceptre, were deposited: The Earl being then appointed by King Charles the Second, one of the Commissioners for managing the government while His Majesty was abroad. Mr. George Ogilvie, of Barras, to whom the defence of this Castle was committed, and bravely defended by him, finding it so closely invested that he could not long- hold out, prevailed on the wife ofthe Minister of Kinneff, a bold and prudent woman, Avho happened to be in the Castle at that time, to assist in conveying them away ; this she did by packing them up in a bundle, as things of no value, and walked out courageously with them ; they were afterwards hidden under the pulpit of Kinneff, until the Restoration : This escape succeeded the more easily, as Mr. J. Keith, who, on the Castle being invested, sailing immediately for France, had industriously caused it to be reported, that he had taken them with him. For this piece of service the King, at his Restoration, created Sir William Keith, Knight Marischal of Scotland, and Earl of Kintore. But, for his faithful and steady service to the Crown, attended in its consequences with many years of confinement, and much loss of property, the brave and loyal Governor Ogilvie \" received no farther mark of Royal favour, or reward,\" than"], [515, "DUN the Title of Baronet, and a new Coat of Arms, expressive of the action, as the motto bears \" Pr\u00e6clarum regi etregno servitium:\" The whole of the Original letters, relating to the Siege of Dunottar, and the preservation of the Regalia, together with the Earl Marischal's receipt granted for them, are in the posses sion of Sir David Ogilvie, Bart., the present Proprietor of Barras, in this Parish. This Castle was inhabited till the beginning of the Eighteenth Century ; but was demolished soon after its forfeiture, when its ruins were repurchased by The Earl, and afterwards sold by him to Mr. Keith, of Rovelston. Mr. Grose has preserved a vieAv of it. DUN-PENDER, v. PRESTON-KIRK. DUNPHAIL, CASTLE, v. EDEN-KEILLIE. DUNREAY, CASTLE, v. REAY. DUNREGGAN, in the Shire of Dumfries; and in the Parish of Glen Cairn. This is an increasing Village, situate on the Northern bank of the Dalwhat Water, over which there is a stone bridge that connects it with Minniehive. It is built on the property of Mr. Fergusson, of Cailloch. DUNROBIN, CASTLE, v. GOLSPIE. DUNROD, in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright : an ancient Parish, now annexed to the Parish of Kirkcudbright : The Church is demolished, but the burying-ground is still in use. It is 4 m. S. from Kirkcudbright. DUNROSS-NESS, inthe Mainland, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shet land . formerly a Vicarage, with the Parishes of Sandwick, and Cunningsburgh united: the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 1000 merks Scotch, and 50 merks Scotch for Communion elements : Patron, Lord Dundas : A handsome Church, with a Pavilion roof, covered with Easdale Slate, Avas built a few years ago at Dunross-Ness : there is another Church for the Districts of Sandwick, and Cunningsburgh, whither the Minister goes to officiate every third Sunday ; that Church has a Kirk-Session of its own, aud ought to form a separate Parochial charge, if there were funds sufficient for the support ofa Minister. The United Parishes constitute what is termed a Ministry; which is 12 miles in length, and, in some places, 6 miles in breadth. All the Inhabitants are Members of the Established Church. The Presbytery of Shetland is not subject to the Juris diction of any Provincial Synod, but depends immediately on the General Assembly. The Resident Population of these United Parishes, in 1801, was 3201, and, in 1811, was 3490. TheParish of Dunross-Ness constitutes the Southern extremity of the Mainland of Shetland ; it is a Peninsula, washed by 3M2"], [516, "DUN the Sea on three sides, and is comparatively the most fertile district in the Shet land Isles. The soil, in the arable parts ofthe Parish, is various : in some places, sandy ; in others, loam, and clay ; and, in several parts, there are extensive tracts of moss. The lands are reckoned by merks-land; each of which ought to contain 1600 square fathoms : to each merk-land, one Cow is allotted, and as the Parish contains 2000 of these merk-lands, there are consequently as many Cows maintained here The air is moist in a great degree ; but by no means unhealthy. Sea-fowls, of various kinds, abound here, several species of Avhich become white in winter; eagles, haAvks, and ravens, are also very numerous, and destructive ; and, in the months of October and November, Swans resort in great numbers to this Parish, and remain about the Lochs of Skelberry and Scousburgh, during the winter. In the years 1789 and 1790, Shetland was visited by some Gentlemen from London, who discovered a rich iron-mine on the Estate of Quendal ; and, in various parts ofthe Islands, the ores of copper, lead, and iron. After the loss of the Flag Ship ofthe Spanish Armada, on the Fair Isle, in 1588, the House of Quendal Avas for some time the residence of The Duke of Medina Cell There are about 200 boats employed in the fishing trade, throughout this Ministry. The principal Creeks are Quendal Bay, Grutness, and West Voe, Avhich lie on each side of Sumburgh Head, the most Southern Promontory ofthe Mainland ; The Latitude of which is 59\u00b0.. 51'. .30\".

DUNSCORE, in the Shire of Dumfries : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, Avas \u00a340..12..10|, being the Teinds of the Avhole Parish, \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements, and \u00a3109. . 7. .l\u00a3 by Parliamentary augmen tation : the manse is in decent repair: the glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Patron, The Crown : In 1649, the Church Avas removed from theloAver end ofthe Parish to nearly the middle of it, where it iioav stands. It is in the Presbytery of Dumfries, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1174, and, in 1811, was 1325. It is 10 m. N. W. from Dumfries. This Parish is about 12 miles in length, and from half a mile to four, miles in breadth: along the river Nith, the surface is level; but, in general, it is hilly ; and, in the upper end, it is rocky and mountainous. Some parts of the soil are deep, and fertile ; but by far the greater proportion is light and shallow, upon a tilly bottom. Much improvement in agriculture has lately been made here : but the high multures, to which a great part of the Parish is subject, are heavily complained of. James Grierson, Esq., of Dalgoner, has considerably augmented the number of Inhabitants upon his estate, by the feus"], [517, "DUN which he has granted. There is no legal Salary for a Schoolmaster; but three Schools have been established, with small salaries arising from the Interest on \u00a3300. bequeathed by a Mr. Grierson, of Edinburgh, many years ago. Peats are the common fuel. On a Farm, called Chapel, are the vestiges ofa Chapel ; and the burying-place around it, has very properly not been disturbed. In this Parish the celebrated Robert Burns rented a farm for some years : and, in the Barony of Monkland, or Friars' Carse, he established, under thc Patronage of Robert Riddell, Esq., of Glen Riddell, a Library, or Reading Society, for the instruction and amusement of the Peasants and Tenants : this Plan is detailed in The Statistical Account, vol. 3. p. 598, and it has been very generally followed in many parts ofthe Kingdom. In the Eleventh Volume of Archaeo logia, p. 106, a description, and engraving, are given of its ancient stone Font. DUNSE, or DUNS, in the Shire of Berwick, formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of Avhich, in 1811, was 66 bolls 1 firlot of barley, 66 bolls 1 firlot of oats, 64 bolls of meal, and \u00a340. in money, together with 9 If acres of glebe : an excellent manse was built in 1783 : Patron, Robert Hay, Esq., of Drummelzier : The Church, an elegant building, was erected in 1792. It is in the Presbytery of Dunse, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 3157, and, in 1811, Avas 3082. It is 40^ m. E. S. E. from Edinburgh. The weekly Market is on Wednesday. The Fairs are holden on the First Wednes day in March, the first Tuesday and Thursday after Trinity in June, 26th of August, and the 17th, or Tuesday after, of November. A General Post-Office is established here. Its name is dertved from the Celtic Avord Dun, a Hill, the ancient site ofthe Town having been ori the summit of a beautiful Hill, called Dunse Law : this hill stands upon a base of between tAvo and three miles in cir cumference, and rises in a gradual ascent, on all sides, till it terminates in a plain of nearly 30 acres, and is elevated 630 feet above the level ofthe sea: afterwards, the Town was built at the foot ofthe hill, on the South, where it now stands. This Parish is 8 miles in length, and 5 miles in breadth, extending over a part of the district of Lammer-Muir, and over the head of that fertile plain, which is called The Merse : that part, which lies in Lammer-Muir, is hilly, and much covered with heath ; but in the South part, the soil is a rich, light, deep loam, with a mixture of clay, exceedingly fertile, and in general inclosed : agriculture is much attended to here. The river Wliittadder, Avhich takes its rise in Lammer-Muir, runs through the Avhole extent ofthe Parish, and contains excellent salmon. The air is dry and healthy. The School of Dunse"], [518, "DUN has long been very deservedly in great repute : the Salary is 300 merks, toge ther Avith School-fees, and a House well calculated for the accommodation of Boarders. There is also a Female Boarding-school, where every branch of elegant and useful education is taught: the Governess has a Salary of \u00a318. from the Heritors, and other Inhabitants, for a certain number of years, be sides school-fees. The roads are good. Robert Hay, Esq., of Drummelzier, is Proprietor of one half of the Parish ; and occasionally resides at Dunse Cas tle, a large, stately, venerable Building, situate about half a mile above the Town, and commanding an extensive view to the South, as far as the Cheviot Hills : it is surrounded Avith several hundred acres of thriving plantations, in the midst of which is a fine sheet of water, called The Hen-pond, about a mile in circumference, and is much frequented by wild ducks in the summer. After the death of the great Earl of Moray, and his Sons, Dunse became the property, if it were not already the estate of The Earl of March, who had married the daugh ter of the one, and the sister of the other ; and from the forfeiture of the Earl of Dunbar, it was invested in the Crown. It was made a Burgh of Barony ; and, at length, the Shire Town, in 1661 ; and continued as such, till 1696, Avhen that pre-eminence was restored to Greenlaw. This Town was still the estate of Lord Home, when he died, and was forfeited, in October 1516. Nearly a mile from Dunse, on the South, in the estate of Mrs. Carr, of Nisbet, and in the Par ish of Edrom, is the celebrated mineral Spring, called Dunse Spa; which is a strong Chalybeate, similar to that of Tunbridge Wells. Cockburn Law, a moun tain ofa conical shape, is elevated about 900 feet above the level ofthe sea, and is a land-mark for ships navigating the German Ocean : on the North side, a little below the middle of the hill , are the ruins of a very old Building, called Woden's or Edivin's Hall; and which is supposed to have been a Pictish build ing, and afterwards used as a military Station. The learned and celebrated Metaphysician and Theologist, John Duns Scotus, was born in Dunse, in 1272: the family, of Avhich this extraordinary man Avas a branch, were heritors of the Parish of Dunse, and continued to be proprietors of that estate which now be longs to Mr. Christie, 'till after the beginning of the Eighteenth Century, and which is called from them in all ancient writings Duns's half of Grueldykes: these lands are adjacent to the Town of Dunse, and the site of the house where he Avas born, is still pointed out. Dunse is much indebted for its prosperity to its late benevolent and worthy Superior, the father of the present Robert Hay, Esq. , of Drummelzier. Its public works are a Bleaching-field, and a large Brewery."], [519, "DUN DUNSINNAN, v. COLLACE. DUNSKAICH, CASTLE, v. SLEAT. DUNSKEY, CASTLE, v. PORT PATRICK. DUNSTAFFNAGE, CASTLE, in the District of Lorn, and Shire of Argyle ; and in the Parish of Killmore. It is situate upon a Promontory, at the entrance of Loch Etive, and about 3 m. N. N. E. from Oban. This Castle is of great antiquity, and is said to have been one of the first seats of the Pictish and Scottish Princes : here was long preserved the famous Stone chair, the Palladium of North Britain, which was used as the Coronation seat; it was removed to Scone by Kenneth the Second, from whence it was taken by Edward the First, and carried to Westminster Abbey, Avhere it still remains. Some of the ancient regalia are presen*ed in the Castle, of which The Duke of Argyle is Hereditary Keeper under the Crown; but it is the property of a Mr. Campbell. Ata small distance are the ruins of an elegant Chapel, where many of the Kings of Scotland are said to be interred ; and, in 1740, a family Cemetery was erected at one end of it. Near this, is a remarkable echo. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. In 1307, Dunstaffnage Castle was possessed by Alexander Macdougal, Lord of Argyle, a friend to the English, but was reduced that year by Robert Bruce. About the year 1455, it seems to have been the residence of The Lords of The Isles ; for hither it was that James, the last Earl of Douglas, after his defeat in Annandale, fled to Donald, the Regulus ofthe time, and pre vailed upon him to take arms, and carry on a plundering war against his Mon arch, James the Second. There is a custom still in use at Dunstaffnage, accord ing to Mr. Nevvte, which expresses in no unpleasiug manner at once the Hos pitality ofthe country, and the attachment ofthe people to their Chief. When _a company of unexpected strangers arrive, which is by no means uncommon in the Highlands, a pole is immediately erected on the battlements ofthe Castle, with a Table-cloth affixed to it for a flag. This serves as a signal to the tenants of certain possessions, to bring fresh salmon, or any other fish that may be in season. Other tenants embrace that opportunity of showing their attachment, or paying their court to the Laird, by presenting any thing that is rare, or which they think may be acceptable.

This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and the same in breadth. The soil is indifferent, and the general appearance ofthe country is naked, and bleak. The air is pretty good, though rather moist. Peats are abundant. It is watered by the small river Medicin. Upon the edge of a muir, is a row of sepulchral cairns ; some of which have been opened, and found to contain human bones and urns.

DUNVEGAN, in the Isle of Skye, and in the Shire of Inverness : it consti tutes part of the Parisii of Killmuir. A General Post-Office is established here. This is a rocky prominence, that juts out into a Bay, on the West side pf Skye. The House of Dunvegan, which is the principal seat of Macleod, the Chief ofthe ancient and powerful Clan of that name, is partly old and partly modern ; it is built upon the rock, and looks upon the water : it forms two sides of a small square ; on the third side is the skeleton of a Castle of unknown anti quity, supposed to have been a Norwegian fortress, when the Danes were mas ters of these Islands. \" It is so nearly entire,\" says Dr. Johnson (who Avas \" entertained here by Lady Macleod with \" all the arts of Southern elegance\"), that it might have easily been made habitable, Avere there not an ominous tra dition in the family, that the owner shall not long outlive the reparation. The grandfather of the present Laird, in defiance ofthe prediction, began the work, but desisted in a little time, and applied his money to worse uses. \u2014 Here we saw some traces of former manners, and heard some standing traditions. In the house is kept an ox's horn, hollowed so as to hold perhaps two quarts, which the heir of Macleod was expected to swallow at one draught, as a test of his man hood, before he was permitted to bear arms, or could claim a seat among the"], [521, "D U R men. It is held, that the return of the Laird to Dunvegan, after any con siderable absence, produces a plentiful capture of herrings ; and that, if any woman crosses the water to the opposite Island, the herrings will desert the coast. Boetius tells the same of some other place. This tradition is not uniform. Some hold, that no woman may pass, and others, that none may pass but a Macleod.\" DUNY, in the Shire of Cromarty, though locally situate in the Shire of Ross ; and constituting part ofthe Parish of Kincardine. It is situate near the Southern bank of the river Carron. See, Cromarty. DUPLIN, in the Shire of Perth ; an ancient Parish, now comprehended in the Parish of Aberdalgie. It is 5 m. S. W, from Perth. Here is an elegant Seat of The Earl of Kinnoul, to which Ancient and Noble Family Duplin gives the title of Viscount. This was the scene of the unfortunate battle, which was fought on the 12th of August 1332, between Edward Baliol, and the Scottish army commanded by The Earl of Marr, then Regent in the Minority of David the Second. In the House are several very fine pictures : and, at a short distance, upon the summit ofthe hill, are the vestiges ofa Roman road. DURIE, v. SCOONIE. DURINISH, v. DUIRINISH.

It is in the Presbytery of Penpont, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1148, and, in 1811, was 1429. It is 6| m. N. b. E. from Thornhill. This Parish is about 8 miles in length, and 5 miles in breadth, and contains about 14,530 acres ; of which, 3000 are arable, and the remainder are in pas ture, and plantations. It is almost surrounded with hills, except a pleasant opening to the South and South-West : and, on the North-East, is a strait Pass, known by the name of The Wall Path, which leads to Edinburgh by CraAvford Muir, and has in it the remains of an old Roman fort, called Deer's Castle, that formerly commanded the remarkable Pass there. The soil is, in general, deep and fertile, inclining to a reddish colour : the hills are partly covered with heath, and partly with verdure, and a strong kind of grass, called bent. The most remarkable mountains are The Lowthers, which seem to con tain the same minerals, as the neighbouring mines of Lead-Hills, and Wanlock- vol. i. 3 N"], [522, "D U R Head. Itis intersected by the river Nith, and its tributary stream, the Carron. The air is dry, and healthy. Free-stone is abundant. The Village of Duris- Deer is pleasantly situate on the Eastern bank ofthe Nith, over which there is a handsome stone bridge of three arches. The roads are indifferent. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together Avith School-fees. There is also another School for teaching English, Writing, and Arithmetic, to Avhich The Rev. Thomas Tod, formerly Minister of this Parish, mortified 1000 merks Scotch ; the interest whereof, and of \u00a314. Sterling that had been saved during vacancies, constitute the whole of the Salary : the Kirk-Session elect the Teacher, according to Mr. Tod's deed of Settlement. The Marquis of Queens berry is almost the sole Proprietor. In the Church is the Mausoleum of the family of Drumlanrig. DURNESS, or DIURNES, in the Shire of Sutherland : formerly a Vicar- age, the Stipend of which, in 1811, exclusive ofthe glebe, Avas only \u00a342.. 16.. 8. Sterling : the manse was re-built in 1786: Patron, The Crown ; but the Noble Family of Reay have always presented, and their Presentees have ever been acceptable to the Inhabitants : The Church is old. It is in the Presbytery of Tongue, and Synod of Sutherland and Caithness. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 1208, and, in 1811, Avas 1155. Itis252f m. N. b. W. from Edinburgh. This Parish : .\"\u2022mprehends the cultivated lands on the Eastern side of Loch Eriboll, commonly called West Moine, together with the tract, denominated Strath-More, and is intersected by the river Hope : its greatest length is computed to be 15 miles, and its greatest breadth 13 miles. The scenery of this Parish is mostly wild and mountainous : considerable tracts are occupied by mosses : towards the shore, however, Avhere the Peninsula terminates in Far-out-Head, there is a series of beautiful fields, and rich green pasture ; and the sides of some of the hills afford a fine natural ver- dure. Loch Borley, which is about a quarter of a mile in length, and about two-thirds as much in breadth, abounds in a species of trout, commonly called Red Bellies. Both the small riA*er which empties itself into the Bay of Durness, and the Hope, afford salmon, and are noAv under lease to a Company. The shores are almost every where rocky, barren, and even destitute of vegetables. Loch Eriboll is a spacious Harbour, in Avhich the smallest sloop may lie in per fect safety, and it appears sufficiently large to receive the whole of the British NaA*y : about 10 or 12 tons of kelp are annually made upon its shores; and it sometimes supplies a small tack of herrings. The tides rush in with great"], [523, "D U R rapidity and violence upon this coast, especially on the Head-lands ; and, above all, at Cape Wrath, one ofthe most stormy Capes in the world, where their violence is increased by means ofa shoal, running out North by East, from the extremity ofthe Cape, for five or six miles, and covered by a depth of water, measuring only from 16 to 24 fathoms. About a mile from the Coast is a rock, called The Stags, the top of which is always above water ; but which is, never theless, formidable to ships approaching Tlie Cape by night : But a still more dangerous rock, the top of which can be seen only in neap tides, is said to lie 9 miles due North from the Cape : a Light-House is much wanted here. Seals abound all round the coast. At Ruspin, is a small dry harbour, lately much improved by the Tacksmen of the fishings, and the kelp shores. There are several remarkable caves, of which that of Smow is the largest, and most mag nificent. In favourable seasons, the Parish produces as much grain as maintains its inhabitants ; but, in years of scarcity, it is supplied from Caithness. No roads have yet been made through this extensive tract of Country. Peats are the fuel universally used through the Parish. The Gaelic language is still generally spoken ; but the English is making considerable progress. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, payable by Lord Reay, with re course on His Lordship's tenants for one half ; together with a School-house, and room for the Master, and School-fees and a feAV small perquisites. The only remarkable monument of antiquity, now remaining in this Parish, is the famous Dun of Dornadilla, in the District of Strath- More : that portion ofthe wall, of this ancient Tower, which is still standing, is 18 feet at the highest part : the ft area appears to have been surrounded with two concentric walls : a large trian gular stone covers the front door, as a lintel : the opposite side has been reduced to rubbish. The Society of Antiquaries of London, with a zeal not to be surpassed in the preservation of every thing curious, have given an ample de scription, and a plate, of this remarkable edifice, in the Archaeologia, vol. v. and also, in vol. x. p. 100. The celebrated Gaelic Bard, Robert Doun, was a native of this Parish : his Songs are Avell known, and discover uncommon force of genius : but it is to be regretted, that they have not been printed, to secure them from mutilation, corruption, or oblivion. This Parish was of old a grass room or shearing to the Bishop of Caithness, and was dis posed of by Bishop Andrew Stuart to the family of Sutherland, who gave it to the family of Lord Reay, with whom it still remains. Lime-stone, and marble, are in plenty ; and the lakes afford abundance of marl. The great disadvantage 3N2"], [524, "D U T under Avhich it labours, is its exposure to the North-West storms, Avhich drive the sand upon it, and have by that means destroyed several good farms, and daily threaten further injury. Cape Wrath is supposed to be the Virvedrum Promontorium, of Richard of Cirencester. DURN, HILL of, v. FORDYCE. DURRINGTON-LAWS, v. GORDON, and LONGFOR-MACUS. DURRIS, or DUIRES, in the Shire of Kincardine : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1792, was \u00a376..12..5\u00a3, being the full valued Teind of the Parish, including \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements, together Avith \u00a381.. 14. .2a. by Parliamentary augmentation : the manse, and most ofthe offices, were built in 1774 : Patron, and sole Proprietor, The Earl of Peterborough : The Church is in tolerable repair. It is in the Presbytery, and Synod, of Aberdeen. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 605, and, in 1811, was 724. It is 4 m. E. b. S. from Banchory Taman. This Parisii contains about 16,912 English acres, partly flat, and partly mountainous, and extending along the South side of the river Dee. The soil upon the Avhole is thin, and sandy ; but a considerable part has lately been improved, and iioav produces excellent crops. The salmon fishings on the Dee hav'e not been profitable, for some years past. On the summit of Mount Goiver is a Chalybeate Spring, called Red Beard's Well, from a robber of that name, and which is used with efficacy in com plaints of the stomach. There are several high Mountains, of which Cairn Monearn is the most lofty, being elevated upwards of 1000 feet above the level ofthe sea ; and, on the top of it, is a very large cairn. The peat-mosses are excellent. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, one half being paid by Lord Peterborough, and the other by the tenants ; together Avith a small garden, school-fees, and perquisites. There is also a benefaction by the late Alexander Hogg, of \u00a3500. in Old 4 per cent. Bank Annuities Reduced, to be applied to different purposes. On a little hill, called Tlie Castle Hill, are the traces of an ancient fortification. Near Durris House, considerable inclosures and plantations have been made by The Earl of Peter borough. DUTHEL, in the Shire of Elgin : formerly a Rectory, Avith the Vicarage of Rothie-Murchus united, since the year 1630; the Stipend of which, in 1811, Avas \u00a364., together with two glebes : the manse was re-built, in 1763 : Patron, The Earl of Seafield : The Church, which was built in 1400, and repaired in 1770, is dedicated to St. Peter. It is in the Presbytery of Aber-Nethy, and Synod of"], [525, "D Y C Moray. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1113, and, in 1811, was 1143. It is 9 m. N. from Aviemore. The United Parishes are about 20 miles in length, and nearly 17 miles in breadth. The river Spey flows between the two Parishes ; and Duthel is intersected by the river Dulnan, or Tjiilenan, for about 14 miles. The soil, on the banks of both these rivers, is fertile, but liable to be overflowed ; the rest of the district is shalloAV, and gravelly : the hills are covered with heath, and are rocky : they abound with game. The Climate is extremely healthy. There are two Schools ; one Paro chial, and the other established by the Society for propagating Christian Know ledge ; \u2014 the Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School fees, and perquisites, and a rood ofland; \u2014 the Salary of the Society School is \u00a39. Sterling, with suitable conveniences, furnished by the Tenants, in whose district the School is stationed. A third part ofthe Parish is under Wood, and about 2183 acres are arable, Avhich supply it abundantly Avith provisions: the only articles of export are black cattle, and sheep. The fuel used here is AA'ood, and peat. There is a Bridge over the Dulnan, which Avas built in the year 1791: The Roads are good, and are kept in repair by the Statute labour, exacted in kind. The language principally spoken here is the Gaelic, and the names of places are mostly derived frorii it, as Craig-Elachie, i. e. Tlie Rock of Alarm : there are two Rocks ofthis name, one at each extremity of the district of Strath- Spey, about 30 miles distant: upon the approach of an enemy, the signal Avas sent from the one to the other, for all persons fit to bear arms, to appear at an appointed place; and hence the Motto of the Grants, \" Standfast Craig- Elachie.\" At the village of Aviemore is a good Inn. The Earl of Seafield is the only Heritor. DWARFIE STONE, v. HOY. DYCE, in the District of Aberdeen, and Shire of Aberdeen: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1810, was \u00a372..16..3f, including \u00a38.. 6..8. for Communion elements, 11 bolls 1 peck 2\\ lippies of bear, 2 firlots of oats, 43 bolls 2 firlots 1 peck 2 lippies of meal, and \u00a332..1..10. by Parliamentary aug mentation : the manse is in tolerable repair : the glebe consists of 5^ acres : Patron, The Laird of Dyce : The Church is old, and dedicated to St. Fergus. It is in the Presbytery, and Synod, of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 347, and, in 1811, was 498. It is 8 m. N. W. from Aberdeen. This Parish is of considerable extent, stretching along* the South side ofthe river Dorc. It is intersected by the ridge of hills, called Tyre-Beggar,"], [526, "DYK Avhich are covered Avith heath, and, upon the summit of one ofthe highest, is a Druidical temple: along the banks ofthe river, the soil is deep and fertile, and agriculture is much attended to. Turf is the common fuel, Avhich is greatly exhausted. The air is dry, and healthy. Here are extensive Quarries of granite, much of Avhich is exported for paving the Streets of London. The roads are indifferent. The College of St. AndreAv's are Titulars of the Tythes, and draAv a considerable sum annually from the Parish. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together Avith some small School-fees, and perquisites, and a rood of land. DYKE, in the Shire of Elgin: formerly a Vicarage, with the Rectory of Moy united in 1624: the Stipend of which, in 1811, Avas 106 bolls 1 firlot of barley, 7 bolls 2 firlots of oatmeal, at 9 stones, with \u00a340.. 15.. 2. Sterling in money, and \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements : there is a glebe of 6 acres at Dyke, and a small one in the Parish of Moy, for which the Proprietor there pays a rent of 6 bolls of barley .- the Minister has also \u00a31.. 13. .4. for grass-money: the manse, and offices, are in good repair : Patrons, The Crown, and the Heritor of Easter- Moy, Hugh Grant, Esq., by turns : A new and commodious Church was built at Dyke, in 1781. It is in the Presbytery of Forres, and Synod of Moray. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (containing the Villages of Dyke, Kintesak, and Moy) was 1492, and, in 1811, was 1427. It is 3f m. W. from Forres. This Parish is of an irregular figure, running up the Moray Firth for about six miles along shore, and stretching from the Coast South ward nearly the same length : it lies principally on the West side of the river Findhorn: Along the Coast is that extensive sandy desart, called Tlte Maviston Sand Hills, which Boethius mentions as being produced by the same inundation of the sea that swept away the princely estate of Earl Godwin, in Kent, and left the Godwin Sands in its stead. And prior to the year 1695, a great part ofthe Barony of Caulbin or Cowbin, called in the former Century, \" The Granary of Moray ,\" was overwhelmed with sand, blown from those Hills. In the Act of Parliament in 1695. cap. 30, the narrative imports, \" That the Barony of Cowbin, and house and yards thereof, is quite ruined, and overspread with sand.\" It appears that the sand, Avhich had been washed up for aces by the tide on the Coast towards the Western limits ofthe Parish of Dyke, was at last drifted by a storm of wind from the West, over the Estate ; one Farm of which, now (in 1794) rented at about \u00a380. alone remains, from which the Land-Tax and other Public Rates are paid for an Estate rated at nearly \u00a3 1000,"], [527, "DYK Scotch, of valued rent ; and which at present Avould probably, but for this acci dent, have rented at \u00a3800. Sterling per annum, or upwards. But the extent of this calamity is not limited to the Barony of Cowbin; it changed the efflux ofthe river Findhorn, by which a part of the Estate of Maurton was destroyed, and drifting Eastward for more than ten miles, buried a great extent of fine land in the Parisii of Duffus. The cultivated part ofthe Parish, is agreeably diversified Avith flats and easy slopes, beautified by the windings of rivulets, Avhich are skirted with natural Avood, and ornamented with Gentlemens' Seats, gardens, and plan tations. The coast is every where sandy, and, behind Caulbin, are beds of Cockels, of a superior flavour. The only river is the Em or Findhorn, which is of considerable value for its Salmon fishings, that are rented by a Company in Aberdeen. The air is dry, and healthy. The Services of Tenants are very gener ally abolished. The roads are in good repair. Three stout wooden Bridges for foot-passengers, have lately been built at Moy, Dalvey, and Barley-Mill, near the fords ofthe Beg-Bourne ; and three small stone Bridges have been erected on the Public road. Here are two Public Schools ; one of them a Grammar School for Boys, and the other for Girls, both of them tolerably endowed. There are two free-stone quarries ; and a limestone rock, at the Boat-pool; but, for want of fuel, it is more eligible to purchase lime, than to burn it here. Peats are very scarce, dear, and of little strength. The Barony of Brodie is the property ofthe very ancient and respectable Family of Brodie, of that Ilk, who are resident on this their paternal Estate. Damaway, the ancient Seat of The Earls of Moray, is an old Castle, nobly elevated, with great range and variety of prospect; and adjoining to it, is a princely Hall, built by Earl Randolph, Regent of Scotland, during the minority of King David Bruce ; its length is 89 feet, and its breadth 35 feet ; the roof is superb, and somewhat resembles that of the Parliament House in Edinburgh: here The Earl of Moray retains a family of Servants, where he occupies the Mains, and keeps the Castle in repair, for his occasional resi dence in the North. Among the pictures is one of The Fair, or Bonny Earl of Murray, as he is commonly called; and who was murdered, as is supposed, on account of a jealousy which James the Sixth entertained of a passion the Queen had for him ; at least such was the popular opinion, as appears from an old Ballad Avritten on the occasion. See, Dalgety. At the Barony of Grange Hill, which formerly belonged to the Prior of Pluscar den, was a Cell of Monks : but, on the purchase ofthis Barony, in 1749, by Sir Alexander Grant, Bart., he changed the name of Grange Hill into that of Dalvey.

DYSART, v. MARY-TOWN. DYSART, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the District of Kirkaldy, and Shire of Fife : a Collegiate Church ; the Stipend ofthe First Minister, in 1811, being 5 chalders of oat-meal, 5 chalders of barley, \u00a316.. 13. .4. in money, tAvo loads of coals a week, and a chalder of salt annually, while the coal and salt Avorks are carried on, together with the Teind of fish caught and sold in the Parish, and half Teind offish brought for sale from other Parishes ; a commodious manse, built in 1779, and a garden, but no glebe : \u2014 the Second Minister has neither manse nor glebe, nor any allowance for them ; his Stipend being \u00a355.. 11.. 0. in money, 2 chalders of oat-meal, 2 chalders of barley, and a load of coals a week, while the Avorks are continued : The Earl of Rosslyn is Patron of both the Benefices, and Titular ofthe Teinds : The Church was re-built about nine years ago. It is in the Presbytery of Kirkaldy, and Synod of Fife. The Resident Population ofthis Toavii, and Parish, in 1801, (including the Villages of Borland, Galaton, and Path-Head) was 5385, and, in 1811, was, For Borland - 228. For The Country District - 292. For The Town of Dysart - 1578. For Galaton - 769. For Path-Head - - 1692. For St. Clair Town - - 947. 5506. It is 14 m. N. from Edinburgh. The Market is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the 6th of May, the third Tuesday in June, the fourth Wednesday in August, and on the 8th of November. It is situate on the Northern coast of the Firth of Forth, and was made a Royal Borough in the beginning of the Sixteenth Century ; but the original Charter, and old Records are lost : in 1546, it is men- tioned as one ofthe principal trading Towns on the Coast of Fife ; its commerce was afterwards much decayed, but in 1756, foreign trade revived, and has since continued. The harbour requires to be deepened, and rendered more secure. Dysart is one ofthe contributary Royal Boroughs with Kinghorn, in sending one Member to Parliament. The revenues ofthe Town are small, arising from some landed property, and the Harbour dues. The principal manufacture is that of linen : for the stamping of which an Office is established here. Upwards of"], [529, "D Y S 17,000 bushels of salt are annually made, and exported. The School-house (a Grammar one) belongs to the Town-Council, who elect the Master, and pay his Salary : which, with perquisites and school-fees, amount to \u00a350. per annum. The chief disadvantage is, a scarcity of good water, particularly in the Town. A General Post-Office is established here. The Parish of Dysart contains 3054 acres. The surface rises gradually from the sea, above a mile to the Northward, and then slopes down to the river Orr or Ore, which forms the boundary on the North-East. The soil is in general light ; and near the coast, which is bold and rocky, it is fertile, and well cultivated. The air is damp and cold, especially when the wind is from the East, but is not unhealthy. Free-stone, of a good quality, is in great plenty ; and there is also lime-stone, of an inferior nature : the chief mines are coal, and iron-stone, which have been Avorked for several centuries ; as, at an early period, the pit is recorded to have been on fire, and was remarkably so again in 1662, supposed to have been occasioned by the spontaneous combustion of a quantity of pyrites; which dreadful occurrence Buchanan describes very elegantly :\u2014 ' \" Vicini deserta vocant: ibi saxea subter \" Antra tegunt nigras vulcania semina cautes,\" \u2014 It has since been three times in flames. Dysart gives the title of Earl to the Ancient and Noble Family of Tollemache. Ofthis Noble Family, whose ex traction is English, there was, in the 25\u00b0 of Edward the First, one Hugh de Tollemache, who held of the Crown the Manor of Bentley, in the County of Suffolk ; and, in the 29th year of that Monarch's reign, had summons to attend Edward's expedition into Scotland. Dysart formerly gave the title of Earl to the family of Murray. Here was formerly a Priory of Black Friars : their Chapel, called St. Dennis, was long* in a ruinous state, but has lately been con verted into a forge. The Romans are said to have had a Station here. A high Rock, commanding the Harbour, is called The Fort, and is said to have been fortified by Oliver Cromwell. 30 vol. I."], [530, "E A G E.

Sterling: the manse is in ruins, but an excellent house is hired for the Minister : the glebe consists of 1\\ acres : Patron, The Earl of Eglintoun : The Church Avas lately re-built in an elegant style. It is in the Presbytery of Glasgow, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 1176, and, in 1811, was 1424. It is 9 m. S. from GlasgoAv, and 52 m. W. S. W. from Edin- burgh. A General Post-Office is established here. The village of Eaglesham is delightfully situate, having been re-built on a beautiful plan by the late Earl of Eglintoun, the proprietor : it consists of two r< nvs of houses, about 200 yards distant, Avith a fine clear rivulet running in thc middle: the area before the houses is appropriated for bleaching, and the sides of the stream are adorned with trees. This Parish is about 6 miles in length, and 5 miles in breadth. From the banks ofthe river Cart, which are loamy and fertile, the ground rises gradually towards the Southern and Western border, where it is muiry, and covered Avith heath. The climate is pure, and healthy. The Salary ofthe Paro- chial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and an excellent dwelling-house. The Public roads are in good repair. Fuel is expensive. This is the most aneient possession of the Montgomeries, Earls of Eglintoun, who are Proprietors of the whole Parish, except three small Farms. Upon the banks of the Cart, are the ruins of the old Castle of Punoon or Poinon; which, it is said, owes its origin and name to Sir John Montgomerie, who, at the battle of Otterburn, in 1388, took Henry Percy, the famous Hot spur, prisoner, with his own hand, and with the ransom or poind money, built thte Castle. EAGLESHAY, ISLAND, one ofthe Orkneys : formerly a Vicarage, united to the ancient Vicarage of Rousay ; at the West part of the Island, is a small Gothic Church, which is dedicated to St. Magnus, the Tutelar Saint ofthe Ork neys : it has a pyramidical Steeple at the West end, and at the East end is a"], [531, "E A L faulted Choir, which joins to the body ofthe Church. It is in the Presbytery of North Isles, and Synod of Orkney. This Island is about tAvo miles and a half long, and one mile broad : the coast is in general sandy, and one or two of the Bays afford shell sand, which has been successfully employed as a manure: the soil is good, but it is indifferently cultivated. On the North side of the Island is a large tract of sand, covered with bent, and containing* great numbers of rabbits. In the month of October, the spongia palmata and oculata are cast on shore here in great abundance. This Island, from its beauty, has been chosen as a fit place of residence by several Illustrious persons. The Families of Douglas, and Monteith, who were its proprietors, not only resided on this delightful spot, but also some of the ancient Counts ; and even the Bishops, allured by its commodiousness, gave it a decided preference as an Habitation : but it is most celebrated for having been the place, where the pious St. Magnus was murdered ; and the Church is said to have been erected on the very spot, where the infamous deed was perpetrated by his ambitious relation. It produces about 70 tons of kelp annually. It is said, that there are no rats here. The Resident Population of this Island, in 1801, was 197, and, in 1811, was 170. Several young men occasionally go from hence into the Army and Navy, and to Davis Straits and Hudson's Bay. This Island is entirely composed of sandstone and sandstone flag, and in some places the strata are very much elevated. It is the property of Captain Baikie, EAGLESHAY, ISLE, one ofthe Shetland Isles ; and constituting part of the Parish of North-Maven. It is situate to the Soutlnvard, and is an excellent Island for grazing. It abounds with Rabbit***. EALAN NA COOMB, or EALAN NA NAOIMPH, i. e. The Island of Saints, off the Coast of Sutherland ; and in the Parish of Tongue. Here were formerly a Chapel, and Burial place, the remains of which are still visible. On the South side ofthe Island, the sea, aster passing for several yards through a narrow channel, spouts up into the air sometimes to the height of 30 feet, through a large circular hole in the rock ; and a few seconds aftenvards, there is a dis charge of water from the East side ofthe Island, with a loud noise resembling the explosion of Cannon. This happens only when it is half flood, and a smart gale at North-West. It has suffered much by the driving of the sand. EALAN NA ROAN, i. e. The Island of Seals, off the Coast of Sutherland ; and in the Parish of Tongue. It is about 2 miles in circumference, and is inha bited by four families, consisting of 36 persons. It is formed of a mixture of 302"], [532, "EAR sand, and a reddish kind of pebble, which appear as if baked together. A feAV years ago, part of the ground, near the middle of this island, sunk in without any visible cause; and, to use the words of Milton, \" left i' th' midst a horrid vale.\" Here is plenty of fresh water, and peat-moss. EALLANG-HEIRRIG, v. INVER-CHAOLAIN. EARL'S-FERRY, in the District of St. Andrew's, and Shire of Fife : in the Parish of Killconquhar. It is m. W. from Ely. This is a Royal Borough of very ancient date, as appears from a copy of its Charter, which was renewed in the year 1589, by King James. It is governed by 3 Baillies, 15 Counsellors, and a Treasurer, the oldest Baillie acting as Provost. It forfeited its right to Parliamentary Representation, in common with some other towns in the same County, from their inability to pay their proportion of the sums necessary for defraying the expenses of a Commissioner ; and Avhen, according to Dr. Robertson, \" the anxiety of our Ancestors to obtain an exemption, was almost equal to the eagerness with which our contemporaries solicit admission into Par liament.\" It is situate on the Northern coast ofthe Firth of Forth, and has a small and secure harbour for fishing boats. Macduff's Cave, in the face of a precipice 130 feet high, washed by the Sea, about a quarter of a mile West from this Village, is the place Avhere the Thane took shelter till he procured a boat from tho Village to cross the Firth, \u2014 whence its name, \" Earl's Ferry.\" EARLS-HALL, v. LEUCHARS. EARLSTON, v. DALRY. EARLS-TOWN, anciently ERSILDUN, in the Shire of Berwick: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend ofAvlrich, in 1811, was \u00a334. in money, 112 bolls of victual, half oats, half barley, and a glebe of about 8 English acres ; the manse was built, in 1724 : Patron, The Crown : The Church Avas built in 1736. It is in the Presbytery of Lauder, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resi dent Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, Avas 1478, and, in 1811, was 1528. It is 3i m. N. b. E. from Melros. Here are two annual Fairs ; one of great resort, on the 29th of June, for sheep, cattle, and horses ; and the other, on the third Thursday of October, for cattle, and horses. According to Mr. Chalmers, it derives its name from the Cambro-British Arcwl-dun, i. e. The Prospect Hill : the Church, and Village of Earl's-towu standing on the East side ofthe Leader, and having on the South a Hill, Avhich commands an extensive view over that"], [533, "EAR river, and the Tweed : but popular tradition attributes it, from being originally the residence of the Earls of March * but, though those Earls do not seem to have ever had a residence at this place, they Avere undoubtedly the principal Proprietors of Ersildun, from the Twelfth Century till 1435, when they incurred a forfeiture. David the First sometimes resided here. On the 4th of March 1505-6, the Barony of Ersildon was granted by James the Fourth to Mungo Home. John Home, and his son Mungo, had established their residence at Colden-Knows, on the Leader, about three quarters of a mile below the village of Ersildon : and from this circumstance, became known by the designation of Home, of Colden- Knows. Their lineal descendant, Sir James Home, of Colden-Knows, succeeded, in 1636, to the Earldom of Home, upon the death of Earl James, without issue. The Kirk-town of Ersildon had, on the 1st of February 1590-1, been made a Burgh of Barony, in favour of John Home, of Colden-Knows, the great Grandson of Mungo : And the grant of James the Sixth was confirmed in 1592. This Parish is about six miles in length, and from three to four miles in breadth ; it is washed on the East by the Eden, and on the West by the Leader, both of Avhich rivers abound with trout: toAvards the banks of the Eden, the surface is level, and the soil light and dry ; in the Western border, it is more uneven, and the soil inclines to a strong clay. The climate is various ; and agues prevail here. There are several Villages, of which Earlstown, and Mellerstain, are the largest. The Parochial School is in the village of Earlstown : the Salary is 300 merks, besides the Interest of 500 merks Scotch, mortified for teaching the children ofthe enrolled poor. There is a School also in the village of Mellerstain, the Master whereof has an annual Salary of \u00a35., which is the interest of \u00a3100. Sterling, mortified by the family of Mellerstain, for teaching a certain number of poor children. There is likewise a Sunday's School in each of these villages, patronised and supported by The Honourable Mrs. Baillie. The great disadvantage under which this Parish labours, is the want of fuel : the peasantry bum turf, and peats : those in the neighbourhood of Mellerstain are conveniently situate for fire-wood, which they get at a very moderate rate : the Proprietors and farmers burn coals, which are usually brought from the vicinity of Dalkeith, at the distance of 25 miles, which necessarily makes the price so high, that the poor cannot afford to purchase them. Lime also is very dear. The roads are tolerable. Earls- Town is famous for being the Birth-place of Sir Thomas Learmont, commonly called Thomas, the Rhymer, the earliest Poet of Scotland. He flourished here during the latter"], [534, "EAS half of the Thirteenth Century, and part of a Tower is still standing, at the West end ofthe village, called Rhymer's Towers, and, upon a stone in the front wall ofthe Church is inscribed ; Auld Rhymers race, Lies in this place.\" EARL'S-TOWN, in the Shire of Clackmannan ; and in the Parish of Tilli coultry.

It is 4 m. S. W. from Glasgow. This Parish is about 4 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth. The surface is beautifully diversified, and the hills are adorned with extensive natural woods, and planta tions : the lands in the vallies are fertile, and are all inclosed, and well culti vated. The Salary of the Parochial School, which is ably and judiciously conducted, is 300 merks Scotch, together Avith School-fees, and perquisites, a garden, and an excellent house, for the accommodation of boarders. Pollock, is the noble Mansion ofthe Ancient family of Maxwell, who have several papers of considerable antiquity and curiosity in their possession. Two of the Ministers of this Parish have written Histories of the Church of Scotland, viz., Mr. Wodrow, and Mr. Crawford ; the History by the former is universally known: he was born about the year 1680, and died in 1734. Of Mr. Crawford, The Rev. Stevenson Macgill, the intelligent Minister of East- Wood, in 1796,"], [535, "EAS observes, \" besides his worth as a Minister, he was a Man of extraordinary \" industry and application, to such researches as were connected with the anti \" quities of Scotland.

The Church History of Mr. Crawford \" has never been published, and, therefore, the writer of this account has been \" at pains to procure some information respecting it. The Manuscript is in the \" possession of the Church. It consists of two volumes folio, containing upwards \" of 1400 pages. Prefixed to the History is a short life ofthe Author. From '\u25a0'\u25a0 this life it appears, that he was a native of Greenock ; that he obtained the \" degree of A. M. in the College of Edinburgh, and that, by the Patronage of \" Mr. John Carstairs, one ofthe Ministers of Glasgow, he was sent to Utrecht. \" There he studied two years, wrote several treatises, chiefly controversial, and \" maintained .gome public disputations. In the year 1671, he was licensed at \" GlasgoAv, to preach the Gospel, by a meeting of Clergymen, holden for the ** purpose in a secret manner, in order to avoid the penalties denounced at that \" time against the Presbyterian Non-Conformists. In 1671, he was, with the \" consent of Sir John Maxwell, privately ordained Minister of East- Wood, at \" Paisley. Enjoying the friendship of the family of Pollock, he often, in those \" perilous times, preached to such persons as ventured to assemble in the house \" of his Patron. Though frequently searched for, he had the good fortune to \" escape falling into the hands of his persecutors : but his Patron was subjected \" to severe distresses, on account of the protection which he afforded him. **-** After the Accession of King William, he bore a principal part in arranging \" and settling the affairs of the Church. His History commences with theintro- , duction of Christianity into Scotland, and ends at the year 1680. He appears \" to describe, at great length, the occurrences, both Civil and Ecclesiastical, \" which took place in the reigns of Charles the First and Second. The wars"], [536, "ECC '* Avhich the First carried on against his Parliament, and the persecution with \" Avhich the last so long harassed the Presbyterians, compose a great part of \" the second Volume.\" EBUD\u00c6, v.

ECCLES, ip the Shire of Beravick : formerly a Rectory, which, in the ancient Taxatio, with the Chapels of Brigham, Letham, and Mersington, were rated at 100 merks: the Stipend, in 1811, Avas \u00a3150. : Patron, The Crown : The ancient Church here Avas dedicated to St. Cuthbert; but, about the year 1250, when a new Church was built, St. Andrew became the Tutelary protector: this Church being too small to accommodate the Inhabitants, the proprietors of the Parish took it doAvn, and erected a handsome Church on its site, after the model ofthe Chapel of Ease in Edinburgh : the manse, and offices, were built at the same time, at the sole expense of Sir John Paterson, having been removed from the place where they formerly stood, Avhich was a little to the South-West ofthe Mansion-House : the glebe was exchanged at the same time, and placed very conveniently in front ofthe manse ; it consists of rather more than 20 acres of good arable ground It is in the Presbytery of Dunse, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale . The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1682, and, in 1811, was 1820. It is 4^ m. S. b. E. from Greenlaw. This Parish contains about 11,000 acres ofland, scarcely one acre of which is waste or use- less : the soil is, in general, good, and consists of loam, gravel, or clay; and the farms are all inclosed in the best manner. The climate, from its low and flat situation, is by no means the most healthy. The river Tweed is the bound- ary on the South, and possesses a valuable salmon fishery, the property of The Earl of Home. Among the natural defects in the situation of Eccles, is the want of running water; in times of severe drought, the brooks and rivulets are often entirely dried up ; and the Farmers are sometimes obliged to drive their cattle to the Tweed, a distance of between two and three miles : another dis- advantage under which it labours, is the distance from coals, and lime ; both these articles being obliged to be brought from Northumberland, which is not less remote than from 14 to 18 miles : The distance from Markets is also ano- ther inconvenience. The Roads are good. Here was formerly a Convent, founded in 1156, by Gospatrick, Earl of Dunbar, for Cistertian Nuns : there are now no remains of it, except two vaults, in the neighbourhood of the Mansion-house of Sir John Paterson, Bart., who converted them into Cellars. About a mile to the North-East ofthe Village, a sculptured Monument, erected"], [537, "ECC to one ofthe Percys, who fell in an engagement with one of the rival family of Douglas: the place where it stands is called Dead Riggs, from the great number ofthe slain *, and so dreadful Avas the carnage, that tradition reports, that a little streamlet in its neighbourhood, \" ran with blood for Twenty-four hours.\" Eccles was erected into a Burgh of Barony, in 1647, on the resigna tion of George Home, of Kaimes : and it was re-granted to John Home, of Eccles, in 1679. ECCLES-FECHAN, in the Shire of Dumfries : an ancient Parish now comprehended in the Parish of Hoddom. It is 72 m. S. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. The great Road, between London and Glasgow, runs through it ; and here travellers meet with good accommo dation, and may be provided Avith Post-horses and Carriages. A Market is holden here every month, and two Fairs in the year, all of which are Avell fre quented : and in the month of January 1788 (then first holden), a market for swine Avas advertised to be holden every Friday, from the beginning of January to the beginning of May : and it has since been continued according to the ori ginal establishment, Avith great convenience and beneficial consequences to the Public. On the Markets preceding the terms of Whitsunday and Martinmas, many persons attend for the purpose of hiring servants for the ensuing half year. Here is a good supply of Butcher's meat. See, Hoddom. ECCLES GREIG, v. CYRUS, ST. ECCLESIA-MAGIRDLE, v. DRON. ECCLES MACHAN, in the Shire of Linlithgow : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of winch?, in 1811, was one chalder of bear, two chalders of meal, and \u00a375. in money, together with \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements : Patron, The Earl of Hopetoun : The Church is dedicated to St. Machan. It is in the Pres bytery of Linlithgow, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 303, and, in 1811, was 267. It is 12 m. W. from Edinburgh ; and 3 m. W. from Kirk-Liston, where a Penny-Post Office is established. This Parish is about four miles in length, being inter sected by the Parishes of Linlithgow, and Uphall ; its breadth is not above a mile : the whole is a flat corn country, producing in abundance the various sorts of grain that are raised in West Lothian ; the soil is partly clay, and partly loam. The air is mild, and healthy. Coals are found upon most ofthe Farms, but none are worked at present. Here is abundance of excellent free-stone. Near the Church is a weak sulphureous Spring, called The Bullion Well, Avhich vol. i. 3 P"], [538, "ECK is resorted to occasionally in scrofulous affections. The Earl of Hopetoun is Proprietor of one half of the Parish. The School-master's Salary is 300 merks, paid partly by the Heritors, and partly by the Tenants ; together with perqui sites, and school-fees. The ruins of West Binny still evince, that they have been a Baronial Residence. ECHLIN, in the Shire of Linlithgow ; and in theParish of Dalmenie. A Village, at the distance of 2^ m. N. fromlvirk-Liston. See, Dalmenie. ECHT, in the District of Kincardine O'Neil, and Shire of Aberdeen : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 16 bolls of barley, 32 bolls of meal, at 8 stone per boll, and \u00a346.. 13.. 3-J in money: the manse, and offices, are in tolerable repair : the glebe consists of 4j acres : Patron, The Earl of Aberdeen : The Church is old. It is in the Presbytery of Kincardine O'Neil, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 972, and, in 1811, was 949. It is 7 m. N. from Banchory Tarnan. This Parish, including part of the Hill of Fare, contains about 11,000 acres. The sur- face is uneven, but few ofthe hills are of great elevation, and many of them are under tillage to the very summit, The soil is partly clay, and partly light sand, and, in many places, highly susceptible of improvement. Peats, and turf, are in great plenty. The Roads are good. Upon the top ofthe Barmekin, a conical hill, are the remains of an ancient circular fortification : there are also several tumuli, and Druidical circles. Housedale, the elegant Seat of The Honourable Alexander Duff, the principal Proprietor, is surrounded with extensive and flourishing Plantations. ECKFORD, or OAK-FORD, in the District of Kelso, and Shire of Rox burgh : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, Avas \u00a3150. : the manse Avas re-built, in 1775, and is very commodious ; the offices have lately been repaired : the glebe is rather small, even including the Pasture ground: Water for the family use, is obliged to be brought from the river Teviot, there being no Spring in the immediate neighbourhood of the house : but pump Avells have lately been dug in the Villages of Eckford, Wester Moss, and Moss Tower, and some other places, which supply the inhabitants plentifully with that necessary article : Patron, The Crown : The Church is in good repair. It is in the Presbytery of Jedburgh, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (comprising the Villages of Caver town, Cessford, Eckford, Moss Tower, and Wester Moss) was 973, and, in 1811, Avas 1007. It is 4h m. N. E. from Jedburgh. This Parish is about 6\u00a3"], [539, "E D A miles in length, and about 4\\ miles in breadth ; the river Kail flows through it from South to North, and is emptied into the Teviot, a little to the Eastward of the Church. The air is dry, and salubrious. A considerable change in the system of agriculture has been introduced within these few years : and the oats are particularly famous. There are no Parochial funds, or mortified money for the Poor. Here is a Public School, and a Dwelling-house for the accommoda- tion of the Schoolmaster, which are kept in repair by the Heritors : the Salary is 300 merks, and perquisites, together with a small piece of ground inclosed for a garden, contiguous to the house ; but, as the School is not central, being to- wards the Western limits of the Parish, some infirm persons are generally employed to teach young children at a distance (in Cavertown, and Cessford), the English language, and the elementary principles of Religion from the Cate- chism : they are furnished with a house gratis by the Farmers, and are satisfied for their trouble with what the Parents can afford. The great disadvantage Avhich this Parish sustains, is the scarcity of fuel. There is an old Bridge, of one arch, over the Kail, at the Mill of Eckford, which is said to have been built by the money arising from vacant Stipends at the time ofthe Revolution ; and there is another over the same water, near its conflux with the river Teviot, which was built at the expense of the County, on the great turnpike road. The fish in these rivers are trout, and salmon ; but the trout in the Kail are superior to those in the Teviot. Various antiquities, and the fragments of human bones, have been discovered in the Tumuli here. There are two Quarries of good free-stone. Sir William Bennet, of Grubbet, Avas born, and resided at Marle field (since sold to The Marquis of Taveeddale, together with the Estate of Grubbet), in this Parish, the greater part of his life : He Avas a Gentleman of considerable genius and learning : and it is reported, that he afforded assistance to Allan Ramsay, in the composition ofthe celebrated Pastoral Comedy of The Gentle Shepherd, and in some other Poetical productions of those times. He was very deservedly respected for integrity and benevolence ; and, indeed, the Avhole Family are said to have been remarkable for hospitality and public spirit : their remains are interred in an aisle, on the North side of the Church, with the following Inscription over the door ; \u2014 \" Hoc monumentum sibi etsuisbene me rentibus, ponendum curavit Dominus Gulielmus Bennet, Eques Auratus, anno Salutis 1724.\" ED AY, ISLAND, one of the Orkneys : formerly a Vicarage, united to the ancient Vicarage of Stronsay : Patron, Lord Dundas : The Church, which is 3P2"], [540, "E D A dedicated to The Virgin Mary, was built about the year 1730, and is in a ruinous state ; it is situate at the distance of seven miles from the manse in Stronsay ; and, out of his small Stipend, the Minister is obliged to pay ls. Sterling of freight, every time he passes over the Ferry to preach in the Island of Eday. It is in the Presbytery of North Isles, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Popu lation ofthis Parish, in 1801, Avas 718, and, in 1811, Avas 580. The Island of Eday is situate to the West of Stronsay, and is separated by a Sound which is about three miles across at the Ferry. It is seven miles in length, and nearly two in breadth ; the East side is green, flat, and tolerably Avell cultivated ; Avlrile its West and North sides consist of hills moderately high, affording abundance of excellent peat, and mostly covered Avith heath. The name which it bears, has in some instances been taken from this bleak clothing of heath, and in others from the number of rapid Eddy-tides with which it is surrounded. This is supposed to be the Ocetis, of Ptolomey. The inhabitants are uncom monly dextrous in the management of their boats, and many have been em ployed, for several years past, in the Lobster-fishing in summer ; Avlrile the majority of the people are occupied in the manufacture of kelp, of which there are produced nearly Eighty tons annually. The proportion of the land in tillage, to the land in pasture, is much less than in most other places ; but this disadvantage is more than overbalanced by the great plenty of excellent fuel which it affords, not only to those who reside on it, but to several of the neighbouring Islands. To this advantage another may be added, result ing from its Harbours. To the North-East, and at a short distance, lies a large Holm, named Tlte Calf, Avhich is distinguished for its fine turf, and sheep pasture ; and between this and the Island of Eday, is an arm of the sea, that opens both to the North and South, forming the noble Harbour of Calf Sound ; another Harbour, but not of equal excellence, lies toAA'ards the West, called Fiers- Ness ; and, in both of these, ships may find very safe anchorage, especially in Calf- Sound. This Island, which is now the property of two Gentlemen, belonged in the Seventeenth century to Lord Kinclaven, Avho built a House here, and erected Salt-pans, which were worked with equal spirit and success during the life-time of their Patron. This Nobleman, who was son of Robert, and brother of Patrick Stewart, Earl of Orkney, had been by Charles the First created Earl of Carrick, which name he con ferred on a Village situate near the Harbour of Calf Sound, and which was through his influence erected by the same Monarch into a Burgh of Barony :"], [541, "1. E D D but, as he died without any laAvful issue, the title became extinct, the house crumbled down, and the Village sunk into obscurity. In 1725 the Pirate Goav, trusting to the defenceless state ofthe country, entered this Harbour Avith a view, no doubt, to extend his depredations from hence as a centre ; and he would unquestionably have done so, to the great terror as well as the detri ment ofthe Inhabitants, had not the resolute spirit of one of the Proprietors, then residing in the house of Carrick, stimulated and supported by his equally intrepid neighbours, seized the Pirate, his CreAv, and his Ship, and thus promptly freed the world of one who had been for a long time a pest to society. The Readhead, which forms one of the sides of the Harbour, contains an excellent free-stone quarry, from Avhence most ofthe country is supplied Avith that article ; and it has been supposed, not Avithout good grounds, that, notwithstanding the distance, it has even furnished stones for the Cathedral of St. Magnus, in Kirkwall. Here is a Standing Stone, called the great Stone of Seter, similar to those which are observed in the other Islands : there are also the remains of several Picts' Houses; and such a number of Tumuli, as may furnish reasonable grounds of conjecture, that this Island has been anciently the scene of military exploits, and of depredation. The Parish of Eday comprehends the Isle of Faray, the Holm of Faray, Little Green Holm, Muckle Green Holm, Red Holm, Rusk Holm, and The Calf of Eday. This is a hilly Island, and is entirely composed of sand-stone, Avhich is of a red colour. EDDERACHYLIS, in the Shire of Sutherland : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a346.. 13.. 4. including* \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements, and\u00a3111..13..4. by Parliamentary augmentation : the glebe, which lies upon the Coast, and near the Church, is of some extent : the manse, and offices, are in -rood order, and are situate close to the fine Harbour of Loch Bad-ca-ul : Patron, The Crown: The Church is in good repair; besides which, there is a place appointed for public Worship at the distance of six miles from it, on the North side of The Kyle of Inchard, in Ashir, and where it is the duty of the Incumbent to officiate once in six weeks : but, as the Parish Church is situate as commo diously as it possibly could be, and pretty central upon the coast, the attendance of the Parishioners there, especially in good weather, is rendered quite conve nient, as Boats can convey them easily from almost the most distant parts of the Parish. It is in the Presbytery of Tongue, and Synod of Sutherland and Caith ness. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, Avas 1253, and, in 181"], [542, "E D D was 1147. It is 22 m. W. S. W. from Tongue, to Avhich place a feAV ofthe Par ishioners are at the expense of a runner, once in the fortnight. The Name of this Parish signifies, \" Between tAvo Kyles or Arms of the Sea ;\" because of its lying between Caolis-Cuin, Avhich divides it on the South from Assint, and Cao lis-Luissard, which separates it on the North from Ashir. \u2014 Caolis-Cuin signifies \" The narroAV Kyle ;\" and is so called, because ofa narrow part about the mid dle of it, near Island Rannoch, Avhere there is a Ferry, which is not above 60 yards broad, though it widens greatly above, and branches out into two consi derable Kyles or Lochs, much frequented by herrings ; it is also broad below this place, aud incloses a green Island, called Stirk's Island ; near Avhich is good anchoring ground for shipping. This Kyle runs up into the country 5 or 6 miles. \u2014 Caolis-Luissard, or, as it is commonly pronounced, Laxford, is a name com pounded of two Celtic words, Lua and Ard, epithets given to it, and to the river Avhich runs into the head of it from Loch Stack, from the rapid and high course of that stream. \u2014 But, though these two Kyles comprehend the Country called Edderachylis, the Parish extends a great Avay farther North, and includes also the Davoch or District of Ashir, which is a Territory of itself, intersected by a considerable Kyle, called Caolis-Inchard, two miles long, and often visited by shoals of herrings ; and it separates that very rugged piece of ground, called Kerru Garbh or \" Rugged Quarter,\" from the North parts of Ashir, Avhich are the best portions of it. Inchard is a contraction of two Celtic words, Innis and Aird, signifying \" High Meadow,\" because ofthe high and rich pasture grounds, lying on each side of the Kyle, and ofthe m*er, which runs into the head of it, and which both go by the same name. As for the Avord Ashir, which the Natives term in English Alshires, and sometimes more improperly Oldshoars, its real meaning, is Tir-Fas ; a designation relative to that more fruitful and cultivated place, of which it was once a part, called Diurnes, for it was the Fair-Hir of old, or \" Waste Pasture Grounds,'' belonging to the ancient Inhabitants of Diurnes. \u2014 The whole ofthis Parish is, therefore, situate in the angle, formed by the At lantic and North Seas : its length, from North to South, being 20 computed miles, and its breadth 10 miles : of which Edderachylis is 12 miles in length, and 10 miles in breadth, and Ashir is 8 miles in length, and 7 miles in breadth. The most prevalent names of the Inhabitants are Maclay, Morrison, and Macleod. The salmon fishings at Inchard, and Laxford, belonging to Lord Reay, are rented by a Company of Merchants in Peterhead ; and who have also a lease ofthe kelp shores on his Lordship's estate. The face ofthe country, like"], [543, "E D D the rest ofthe Highlands, is mountainous and rocky, and, to a stranger, exceed ingly rugged. The more inland parts, which constitute Lord Reay's deer For est, are nothing but a vast group of dreadful Mountains, with their summits piercing the clouds, and divided only by deep and very narroAV vallies, whose de clivities are so rugged and steep, as to be dangerous to travellers not furnished with guides Yet these wilds afford excellent pasture, in many places, to all sorts of cattle, being clothed with verdure to the tops of the highest mountains. The Boundaries of the Forest are very extensive, making a considerable, if not the greater part, of Lord Reay's estate ; but that part of it which is reckoned the best, and abounds most with deer, is that which belongs to this Parish. The inhabited places are only those next the sea, and some others on the confines of the Forest, which happen to be someAvhat level, and thereby fitter for rearing cattle, or the culture of corn : and though, towards the coast, the ruggedness of the ground be less, and the mountains seemingly subside, or present a less awful or forbidding appearance, yet rocks and marshes, lakes and mountains, though of less magnitude, are all along continually intermixed : so that, excepting pas ture for cattle, it seems but very indifferently calculated by nature for any other purpose. The Lakes are stored with a variety of trout of different sizes ; Loch Moir, which is 3 miles long, and half a mile broad, never freezes in the severest season : Loch Stack is two miles in length, and half a mile in breadth : both these Lochs are connected by a small stream, and out of the latter runs the con siderable river of Laxford. All these Lakes and rivers form a pretty straight line which divides Edderachylis from the lands of Ashir, and was formerly Tlie March separating these properties from each other. The fuel from the peat mosses is plentiful, and good. There are no roads, but such as the feet of men and cattle have made. But what renders Edderachylis peculiarly happy, and far so beyond other parts ofthe Highlands, is the fisheries upon its coast, and its many excellent Bays and Harbours, where shipping of all sizes can enter, and moor close to the land, at all hours of the day and night, in perfect safety. Off the coast, are a number of small Islands of different sizes, many of them afford ing pasturage to small cattle, especially lambs, in summer and harvest, which in these spots require no herding, and are safe from foxes : The only inhabited Island is Handa. Game of all sorts abound here ; and the numbers and variety of sea fowls are prodigious. Though rains are frequent and heavy here, the cli mate is nevertheless very wholesome. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, and perquisites. The native Inhabitants are all connected by blood, and"], [544, "E D E feAV strangers dAA'ell among them, so that they assist each other, and scarcely any are real objects of Charity. The only monuments of antiquity in this Parish, are the ruins of four dry stone Round ToAvers, supposed to have been erected by the Norwegians : two of them have been used as Cemeteries, even to the present times ; a practice, Avhich probably had its rise from their being a security against the ravages of Wolves, that were numerous and destructive in this country, and where they were not wholly destroyed until of late years. See, Highlands. EDDERTOWN, or EDERDOUN, in the Shire of Ross: formerly a Vicar age, the Stipend of Avhich, in 1811, was 120 bolls of grain, besides Vicarage, and \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements; Patron, The Honourable Mrs. Mackenzie, of Cromarty: The Church, and manse, are old, and in bad condition. It is in the Presbytery of Tain, and Synod of Ross. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, Avas 899, and, in 1811, Avas 846. It is situate in that part ofthe Coun try, called Easter Ross, at the distance of 4| m. W. N. W. from Tain. This Parish is about 10 miles in length, and 7 miles in breadth, stretching along the Southern shore ofthe Firth of Tain. The soil is in general deep, and rich ; but the harvests are late. Peats, and turf, are abundant. The Salary of the Paro chial School is 300 merks, and a rood ofland. Tradition preserves the remem brance ofa battle fought here with the Danes: and, about four miles from the Church, by the sea side, is an extensive cairn or dun. EDENHAM, in the District of Kelso, and Shire of Roxburgh : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3111. . 2.. 2\\, including \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements, and \u00a347..4..5\u00a3 by Parliamentary augmentation, toge ther Avith a manse, and glebe : Patron, The Crown : The Church, which was built about 45 years ago, is very small, and insufficient. It is in the Presbytery of Kelso, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 598, and, in 1811, was 533. It is 2\\ m. N. N. E. from Kelso. It is pleasantly situate on the small river Eden, which rises in the bor ders ofthe Shire of Selkirk, and joins the Tweed at Edenmouth, about two miles below the Village. It is regularly built, the Houses being all of brick, and co vered with tiles or slates. Here is a manufacture of woollen cloth, similar to that called English Blankets, and an extensive Brewery ; both of them planned and established by the public spirit of the late James Dickson, Esq., M. P., when he became Proprietor. This Parish extends about three miles and a half in every direction ; it is Avatered by the Eden, and bounded by the Tweed on the South and South East ; the soil is exceedingly fertile, and the surface is beautifully"], [545, "E D E varied, having two rising grounds, one on the North side ofthe Eden, near the Village, called Edenham Hill, and another between the Tweed, and the Eden, called Henderside Hill; the height of neither of them is great, though not ascer tained, and they are both well cultivated. This Parish is not quite a mile and a half distant from the English Border, at the Burn of Carham (in Northumber land), on the opposite side of the Tweed, formerly well knoAvn by the name of The March Burn. Fuel is very expensive here ; as there are no coals, but what are brought from Northumberland, at the distance of 16 or 18 miles. The Roads are good. There is a small rising ground, West from the village, called The Picts Knoiv ; out of which, some years ago, three stone coffins were dug, one of them containing* an urn : The Know has since been inclosed, and planted with trees. A Farm in this Parish is named Comb Flat, which seems to be so denominated from its containing extens_ATe earthen mounds, called Comb Knoics : as, before the Union of the Kingdoms, this Avas often the scene of warfare, these tumuli seem to have been raisedby art, as means of defence. James Thomson, the celebrated author of The Seasons, Avas born at Edenham manse in the year 1700 ; he was the son of The Rev. Thomas Thomson, the second Minister of this Parish after the Revolution. It is unnecessary to enlarge here upon the merits of an author so well known, and Avhose genius and abilities do so much honour to his native country. Under the patronage of The Earl of Buchan, and other patriotic gentlemen, it has been proposed to erect a monument to his memory, on the summit of Edenham Hill; but the plan has not been accomplished ; \u2014 several Noblemen and Gentlemen, howeA'er, with a laudable zeal for the literary fame of their country, have met annually at Edenham for some years past, to celebrate Thomson's Birth-day, and to forward the subscriptions for the erection of that Monument ; Many years need not surely elapse, before the design is executed ! \u2014As early as the Twelfth Century, the mother Church of Edenham had two dependent Chapels ; the one at Newton, which is now Newton Don, the elegant Mansion of Sir Alexander Don, Bart. ; and the other at Nathan-thorn, which has been contracted to Nanthorn. Robert, the Bishop of St. AndreAv's, aa*1io died in 1158, confirmed the connection between the mother Church of Fdenham, and the Chapel of Newton, so called in contradistinction to the Old-town of Edenham. Arnold, the Bishop of St. Andrew's, who died in 1 162, confirmed to the Monks of Coldingham, the church of Edenham, Avith the chapels of Newton, aud Na than-thorn. Edenham was not without its Hospital, as Avell as its Church: which appears by a Writ of EdwArd the Third, in 1348, for restoring the 3Q"], [546, "E D E Hospitals of St. Mary of Berwick, and of Edenham to Robert de Burton : this Hospital Avas dedicated to St. Laurence, and seems to have been founded by thc Edmondstons, of Edenham, who Avere Patrons of it. EDEN-KEILLIE, in the Shire of Elgin : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of Avhich, in 1811, Avas \u00a341. .2. .2\\ Sterling, and 3 chalders of victual, one half bear, the other half meal , with a glebe of 8 acres, and a good garden ; the manse is in tolerable condition : Patron, The Earl of Moray : The Church Avas built in 1741. This Avas formerly the Seat ofthe Arch-deacon of Moray, and of which he was Patron and Titular. It is in the Presbytery of Forres, and Synod of Moray. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 1123, and, in 1811, was 1215. It is 8~ m. S. from Forres. The name of this Parish is of Gaelic origin: Aodin Coillie, i. e. The Face ofthe Wood, and is descriptive of the nature of the Parish, which contained the two Royal Forests of Tarnaway, or Darnaway, and Drummyne. In the Public records there is a Charter preserved, by King David Bruce, granting to Richard Cummyne, a Predecessor of Cummyne, of Altyre, an Heritor in this Parish, the Office of Forester of the King's Forest of Tarnaway, in the Earldom of Moray. And, in 1478, there is another grant to Thomas Cummyne, of Altyre, of the Office of Forester of the Forest of Drummyne. The remains of natural Avood, and the great quantities of oak and fir, found in the mosses of this Parish, prove that the Avhole face of the country was formerly covered Avith wood : and the names of many places show, that it once abounded with deer. This Parish is about 12 miles in length, and about 10 miles in breadth : it is sometimes called Brae-Moray, and compre hended Ardclach, which was not erected into a separate Parish until the year 1638. The surface is in general hilly, but not mountainous ; the most elevated land, called The Knock of Brae-Moray, being of inconsiderable altitude: the soil of the lower part of the Parish, near the rivers, is of a light dry quality, rather tending to sand ; but, when properly managed, is very fertile and produc tive ; a very great proportion consists of muir and moss. The climate is parti cularly healthy. There are Bridges over the rivers Divie, and Dorback, but one is especially wanted over the Findhorn : and in the latter river, is a profitable Salmon fishery, belonging to The Earl of Moray, and which is let to a Company in Aberdeen. Vast plantations have been made by the proprietors ofthe several estates of Darnaway, Dunduff, Logie, Relugas, and Dunphail. The Salary of the established School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and per quisites, and a rood ofland. There is only one School at present in this Parish,"], [547, "E D E supported by The Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, though there is a claim for three, in consequence ofa donation by Duncan Cumming, M. D., in 1714; it is, however, of great utility, being situate in a part of the Parish, altogether detached from the Church, and the Parish School. In the Southern part ofthe Parish, among the hills, betAveen Strathspey and Brae-Moray, stood The Castle of Loch-an-Dorb, built upon an Island, which is situate in the middle of a Lake of the same name : it appears to have been a very consider- able place, and a Fortress of great strength. Catherine de Beaumont, Avidow of David de Hastings, Earl of Athol, Avho was killed at the battle of Ki 11- Blaine, in 1335, resided in this Castle, Avhich was blockaded by Sir Andrew Moray, the Regent, during the captivity of King David Bruce. In the following year, Edaaard the Third of England led his army Northward, the length of Inverness, and, on his way thither, raised the siege of this Castle. It seems aftenvards to have been converted into a State Prison : for, in the year 1342, the famous William Bullock, who was a great favourite of King David Bruce, was imprisoned there, and died through extremity of cold and hunger. The remains of this Castle cover a space of ground, not less than 100 square yards. The Downe Hill of Relugas seems to have been a Fortress of still greater anti- quity, and used as such far beyond the period of authentic History : it appears to have been a place of strength, to which the inhabitants of the countiy* retired with their cattle, upon the invasion ofthe Danes, to which the country of Moray was so frequently exposed : it is a conical hill, 220 feet high, on the summit of which is a level space, about 60 yards in length, and 20 in breadth : round a considerable part of it runs the rapid river Divie, in a deep rocky channel : and, where not defended by the river, it is encircled by a deep fosse or ditch, with a strong rampart on the outside, mostly composed of stones, some of which have the appearance of vitrification. \u2014 About a mile higher up the Divie, stands The Castle of Dunphail, upon a rock ofa very singular appearance, surrounded by a deep gully or narrow glen, formed probably by the river, which, at a very remote period, seems to have run in this channel : the rock is of a considerable size, with a level area upon its summit, similar to The Downe Hill, of good soil, covered with grass, and several trees groAving upon it : the sides are so steep, that it is altogether inaccessible, except upon that next the river, where there is a narrow road leading up to the Castle : it formerly belonged to a family ofthe name of Dunbar, and is now the property of Alexander Penrose Cumming, Esq., of Altyre. The very singular Bridge of Rannich is of great antiquity; 3Q2"], [548, "E D I for tradition says, that it derived its name from the Illustrious Randolph, Earl of Moray, avIio was Regent of Scotland, aster the death of King Robert Bruce. In the loAver part ofthis Parish, the Scottish dialect is only spoken ; but, in the upper part, the Gaelic is still in use : and until lately, the Minister preached one part ofthe Sabbath in Scottish, and the other part in Gaelic.

This is a beautiful Gothic building, in length, from East to West, on the outside of the Wall, 206 feet : its breadth, at the West end, is 110 feet, in the middle 129 feet, but, at the East end, only 76 feet. It is adorned with a lofty square ToAver, the top of which is encircled Avith open figured stone-work, resembling the ornaments that enrich the circlet of an Imperial Crown. From each side and each corner ofthe Tower, rises a slip of stone- work, which, meeting in the top with that which springs from the opposite side, forms four arches intersecting each other, and completing the figure of an Imperial Crown, the summit ofAvhich terminates in a pointed Spire. The Church is built on a very elevated situation, and the height of the Spire is 161 feet. At the Refor- mation, this Church was, for the greater commodious- ness of the Inhabitants, divided by partition-walls. The four principal apartments are allotted for Divine Wor- ship, the lesser ones are appropriated to other purposes. The chief of these Divisions is called The North or High Church : it is formed out of the Choir of St. Giles's : in it are The King's Seat, those of the Lord Provost and Magistrates, and of the Judges of the Court of Session, this being the principal Church in the City : Two Ministers"], [549, "E D I Resident Population.

The City of Edinburgh is 380^ m. N. b. W. from London. The Cathedral Church of St. Giles is in the Latitude of 55\u00b0.. 57V. 38\" North, and in the Longi tude of 3\u00b0.. 11'. .55\" West from The Royal Observatory at GreeiiAvich. The Markets are Avell supplied with provisions of all kinds, and at a moderate price. Good water is conducted in leaden pipes from a distance of four miles, and every part of the City, and Leith, are amply provided with that necessary article. It sends one Member to Parliament ; there are Thirty- Three Voters ; and the Common Clerk is the Returning Officer. In the Political Constitution of Edinburgh, the Town Council have the direction of all Public Affairs : the Members of that Body being The Lord Provost, 4 Baillies, a Dean of Guild, a Treasurer, one Old Provost, 4 Old Baillies, one Old Dean of Guild, one Old Treasurer, 3 Merchant Counsellors, 2 Trades Counsellors, 6 ordinary Council Deacons, and 8 extraordinary Council Deacons : and from these The Lord Provost, Dean of Guild, 4 Baillies, and Treasurer, are elected. The Lord Provost, who is styled Right Honourable, is High Sheriff, Coroner, and Admiral within the City and Liberties, and within the Town, Harbour, and Road of Leith ; he has also a Jurisdiction in matters of Life and Death ; he is Preses of the Convention of Royal Boroughs, Colonel of the Trained bands, of the City Guard, and Captain of the Gaol : within the City he has the precedence of all the great Officers of State, and the Nobility, walking on the right hand of the King, or His Majesty\u00b0s Commissioner, and has the privilege of a Sword and Mace carried before him. The Baillies have Jurisdiction under the Lord Provost. The Dean of Guild has the charge of the Public Buildings, and no house can be erected without his Avarrant. Formerly the Lord Provost was one of the Officers of the Scottish Parliament ; all the Magistrates are Sheriffs- Depute, and Justices of the Peace. The Town Council are Patrons of all the"], [553, "E D I Churches in Edinburgh, and of most of the Professorships in the University : they are Superiors of the Canongate, Portsborough, and Leith, and appoint certain of their own number Baillies of those Boroughs of Barony : they are ealled, The Baron Baillie of the Canongate, and Portsborough ; and that for Leith is called, The Admiral of Leith ; because, within that District, he has a Jurisdiction in maritime affairs: these Baron Baillies appoint one or two inhabit ants ofthe respective Baronies their substitutes, who are called Resident Bail lies ; and who hold Courts in the absenee of the Baron Baillies, for discussing Civil causes of small moment, and petty offences. For the safety ofthe City, The Toun Guard and Watchmen patrole every night ; and the Police is so strict and well conducted, that robberies are very rare, and in no City of its size, are the persons and properties of the Inhabitants so free from predatory assaults. The Revenue ofthe City of Edinburgh is ranged principally under tAvo classes, The Proper, and Tlie Appropriated ; and these arise partly from duties of different kinds, and partly from landed property : The City Treasurer, who is, ex qfficio, a member ofthe Town Council, is no more than the Town's Cash keeper ; to collect the Revenues, and keep an account of them, is the office of The City's Chamberlain. The Fourteen Corporations have each the right to elect a Deacon, who becomes a Member of Council, Ordinary or Extra ordinary. The ground upon which the City is built, is perhaps as singular, and in many respects inconvenient, as can well be imagined. The Palace of Holyrood-House, the Easternmost boundary of the City, stands on a plain within two miles ofthe river Forth, from Avhich it rises by a gradual ascent of ninety-four feet from high-water mark: from Holyrood -house there begins the narrow point of a hill, which gradually extending itself in breadth, rises in a steep and straight ridge, from which its sheh ing sides decline ; the ridge termi nating in an abrupt precipice, at the distance of a mile in length, and 180 feet above Holyrood-house. The ridge of this Hill forms a continued and very magnificent street, and from its sides, Lanes and Alleys, here called Wynds and Closes, are numerously expanded. The declivity of the hill on the South is terminated by a level strip, on which the street called The Cowgate is built ; thence the ground rises precipitately to the South, and terminates in a plain. On the North, the descent from the High Street is steeper, and more profound. It is bounded by an inconsiderable morass, which formerly being overfloAved, formed a Lake, called The North Loch, from the North side of Avhich a bank rises, and spreads itself into a level field. The City, until within these foAV years, vol. i. 3 R"], [554, "E D I has occupied the same space of ground for upAvards of 250 years ; and it came gradually to be more fully possessed, till the houses Avere crowded together, and piled to a height, perhaps not to be parallelled ; some of them amounting to twelve stories : these Avere denominated Lands ; the access to the separate lodgings, in these huge piles, Avas by a common Stair case, exposed to every inconvenience arising from filth, steepness, darkness, and danger from sire : and such, in a great measure, is the situation of The Old Town at this hour. The area of the ancient and extended Royalty of Edinburgh is about two English miles, from the West end of the Fountain- Bridge to the East end ofthe Abbey-Hill, and nearly the same length from the Grange Toll-bar on the South lo Broughton on the North, and the circumference is about seven miles. And the extended Wall of the City Avas, except in the South-West quarter, the same Avith that which noAV circumscribes the ancient Royalty. The Parliament House is now occupied by the Courts of Session and Exchequer. The High School (erected on the site of the Dominican Convent) has long been deservedly famous for the eminent Scholars which it has produced : the old buildings becoming ruinous, a new edifice, on an elegant and extensive plan, Avas erected in 1777, for the accommodation ofthe teachers and their scholars : there is a Rector and four Masters, Avhose Salaries are trifling, but their fees for teaching render it a place of considerable emolument. Be sides The High School, there are Four Established English Schools under the Patronage of the Town-Council ; and many private Schools, where every branch of Education is taught at a moderate rate. Among the Charitable Foundations, Heriot's Hospital stands most prominent, both in point of ele gance and importance : this beautiful Gothic pile was founded in 1628, accord ing to a design of Inigo Jones, and Avas finished in 1650, at the expense of \u00a330,000., in consequence of a bequest by George Heriot, goldsmith and jeweller to James the Sixth, \"for the maintenance, relief, and bringing up, of so many poor and fatherless Boys, Freemen's sons ofthe Town of Edinburgh :\" the annual Revenue of this Charity is about \u00a34000., and about 140 boys are boarded and educated on the Institution. In Philosophy and general Literature, Edinburgh possesses many Societies and Institutions: The Royal Society of Edinburgh, The Society of Antiquaries, and The Speculative Society, have benefited Mankind by their Genius, their Researches, and their Taste. The Advocates' Library is a very magnificent Collection, and is managed upon principles, and with an attention which render it as useful, as it it is valuable."], [555, "E D I The celebrated Sir George Mackenzie, Lord Advocate of Scotland, had the merit of projecting this institution and of founding it, in the year 1682. For some time after its Institution, no regular Fund Avas appropriated to the use ofthe Library; and it derived its support chiefly from the Donations that were made to it. The Catalogue of Noble, and even Royal Donors, evince how much it has been thought to deserve encouragement. As every Advo cate, at his admission, pays a certain sum to the Faculty, part of this was allotted to supply the Library ; and, as the Admission money has been raised, the quota for the Library has been increased proportionally. The Statute of Queen Anne, which, for the encouragement of Learning, vests in authors a Literary property, or monopoly over their works, also aids this Collection : for, by this it is provided, that, to entitle the Author to that Monopoly, a Copy of every book entered in Stationers' Hall must be sent to the Advocates' Library, as well as to the Universities ofthe United Kingdoms. This Collection amounts to up wards of 30,000 volumes, in all Sciences, and in many languages. Of these, a Catalogue, in two voliimes\u20ac/b_Vo, has been published : The first was published in the year 1742, by the learned Thomas Ruddiman, the best Antiquary that Scotland has produced, and by Mr. Walter Goodall, Keepers ofthis Library : The second volume, consisting of its late acquisitions, was compiled in the year 1776, by Mr. Alexander Brown, the late Librarian, whose accuracy and oblig ing disposition rendered his management of this Library extremely acceptable to the Proprietors : both these volumes are made out upon the plan ofthe Bib liotheca Card. Imperialis : and, in 1787, an Appendix was added. It may not be improper to observe here, that David Hume Avas, for some time, Keeper ofthis Library. Hospitality is a leading feature ofthe Inhabitants. \u2014 The University of Edinburgh was founded in the year 1581, by a Grant obtained from James the Sixth, by the Magistrates and Town Council. The Patrons, aided by va rious Donations, purchased the area belonging to the Collegiate Provostry, and Prebends ofthe Kirk-of-field, on the South side of the City, and begun imme diately to prepare the buildings in the best manner, for the reception of the Teachers and Students : and, in the Month of October, 1583, Robert Rollock, Avho had been invited from a Professorship in St. Salvador's College, St. An drew's, begun to teach. He was elected Principal in the year 1586, and four other Professors were soon after appointed. In 1617, James the Sixth having visited Scotland, after his Accession to the CroAvn of England, and having ordered a public Philosophical disputation at Stirling Castle, was so satisfied 3R2"], [556, "E D I with the merits ofthe Members ofthe University of Edinburgh, that he con ferred upon it many privileges, and he ordained, that in future it should bear the name of\" King James's College,\" which it still retains in all its Diplomas and Public Deeds. For several years, the Foundation of the College was only a Principal, and four Rectors or Professors of Philosophy : but a Professor of Humanity or Latin Av*as afterwards appointed, a Professor of Mathematics, and one for the HebreAV and Oriental languages. The Medical Professorships were instituted in 1685 : but these Avere only Titular, till the year 1720, Avhen, in con sequence ofthe great exertion'and abilities of Alexander Monro, M. D., Senior, an attempt Avas made to teach every branch of Medical Knowledge in a regular manner, and the attempt succeeded so well, that, ever since, the reputation of The University, as a School of Medicine, has been constantly increasing in Great Britain, and even amongst distant Nations. The celebrity of this College has been greatly owing* to the uniform attention of the Magistracy in filling the va cant Chairs Avith Men of known abilities in their respective departments, and they have always been attentive to the Institution of neAV Professorships, as the Public seemed to demand them : most of the Chairs have small Salaries ; and the Salary of the King's Physician is divided amongst those of the Faculty of Medicine, who have none. The Institution, in 1\u00a311, consisted of a Principal, and three Professors ofthe Faculty of Theology, \u2014 four Professors of the Faculty of Laav, \u2014 eight Professors of the Faculty of Medicine, \u2014 seven Professors ofthe Faculty of Arts, \u2014 and a Professorship of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, has lately been established. Besides these, two ofthe Medical Professors give regular Clinical Lectures on those cases in The Royal Infirmary, which are judged to be of great importance. In conferring Degrees, those of Doctor of Divinity and Law are Honorary, and are conferred on Men of known Learning and Talents ; those of Master of Arts, and Doctor of Medicine, are conferred on Candidates, after strict private and public Examinations. The number of Students, in 1810, in the different Classes amounted to 1800. There are only fifty Bursaries, and these do not exceed \u00a312. per annum. The Winter Session lasts from the middle of October to the beginning of May ; and the Summer Session, during which Botany, Natural History, and the Clinical Lectures are taught, begins Avith May, and lasts until August. The Professors are distin guished by long black Gowns, but the Students have no particular dress. The old Buildings being very mean, and unfit for the reception of so many Professors and Students, and quite unsuitable to such a flourishing University, and the im proved state of the City, the Magistrates and Council set on foot a Subscription,"], [557, "E D I for erecting a new and magnificent Structure, according to a Design ofthe late Robert Adams, Esq., the Architect. The estimate for completing the whole Avas \u00a364,000. , and of this sum nearly \u00a330,000. was immediately subscribed. On the 16th of November 1789, the Foundation stone was laid with much solemnity and grandeur by The Right Honourable Francis Lord Napier, Grand Master-Mason of Scotland, in presence ofthe Magistrates of Edinburgh, the Principal, Profes- sors, and Students of the University, and a number ofthe first Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom. After the Committee had expended the Subscriptions, which amounted in the whole to about \u00a338,000. , the building Avas obliged to be given up, and though the North front, and part of the East is now finished, it is probable, unless Parliament makes it a National concern, and grants large supplies, it will never be finished : but the whole, if completed, will be one of the most splendid structures of the kind, and at the same time the most commodious. Connected with the University are The College Library, The Observatory, and The Botanic Garden: \u2014 The Library Avas founded in the year 1580, by Mr. Clement Little, Advocate, who bequeathed it to The Town Council ; and it Avas for some time under the direction ofthe Ministers of Edinburgh, but it was after- wards presented to The University. Like other Collections ofthe same nature, it is entitled to a copy of every work entered at Stationers' Hall ; and it receives from each Student at matriculation, a small contribution, and \u00a35. from each Professor on his Admission: these sums amount to about \u00a3170. per annum. Besides a valuable Collection of Books, and Manuscripts, it has several excellent Portraits : and a fine marble Bust ofthe late celebrated William Cullen, M. D., has been erected by the Members ofthe Faculty of Medicine. The Museum of Natural History contains a tolerable Collection of natural Curiosities, and the number is daily increasing. The Collection of Anatomical preparations, prin- cipally made by Dr. Monro, and his Son, is exceedingly valuable : as are also the Midwifery preparations : \u2014 The Observatory is situate on the Calton-Hitt, and is now under the direction of the Professor of Natural Philosophy : it is far from being complete, though it contains the famous reflecting Telescope, invented by the late Mr. James Short, and esteemed one of the most perfect instruments of its kind : \u2014 The Botanic Garden is about a mile from the Uni versity, on the road from Edinburgh to Leith ; it consists of about five acres of ground, and contains a great variety of plants, brought from various parts ofthe World.

The name of this District has undergone several changes : during the British times, it was called Pen-ti-achob : before the year 1170, Pen-ti-achob had been changed to Gillemoreston : in 1189, being in the possession of Eadulfe, he again changed its name from Gillemoreston to Edulfeston ; which was afterwards softened into Eduleston, and at length corrupted into Edlestown. In a taxation of the Prebends of the Church of Glasgow, in 1401, EdlestOAvn is rated at \u00a33. The Fairs are holden on the 5th of July, and 25th of September. EDROM, properly ADER-HAM, in the Shire of Beravick: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150. Sterling, and a manse, and glebe : Patron, The Crown : The Church Avas built, in 1732, and is noAv in good order. It is in the Presbytery of Chirnside, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1355, and, in 1811, was 1360. It is 2\\ m. N. E. from Dunse. This Parish is about 10 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth ; extending* along the foot ofthe Lammer-Muir Hills, and into the flat country of The Merse: a great part of the soil is fertile, and, when well cultivated, produces good crops of corn ; but, towards the hills, it is moor ish, and shallow ; it is well drained, and inclosed. The air is salubrious. The roads are tolerably good. This Parish is said to obtain its name, from its situa tion on the Southern bank of tbe river White Ader, commonly pronounced Whitt-"], [560, "E D Z adder; and signifying, The Hamlet on thc Ader. The Whittadder rises in the Lammer-Muir Hills, as also does the Blackadder, Avhich falls into it at a Vil lage, called Attantown, in this Parish. The once celebrated Mineral Spring, called Dunse Spa, in the estate of Nisbet, is on the borders of this Parish ; but it is noAv in disrepute. Robert Blackader, the first of the Archbishops of Glasgow, Avhose Family derived its surname from Blackader in this Parish, built a vaulted Aisle to the ancient Church. EDZELL, partly in the Shire of Forfar, and partly in the Shire of Kincar dine : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend ofwhich, in 1811, Avas \u00a3129.. 6. .10., includ ing \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements, 8 bolls 3 firlots 3-f lippies of meal, 5 bolls 2 firlots 1 peck 2\\ lippies of bear, and \u00a313.. 19.. 11. by Parliamentary augmenta tion, and a glebe : Patron, The Crown : The Church is in very bad repair, incommodious in itself, and inconveniently situate for the whole Parish. It is in the Presbytery of Brechin, ancl Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population ofthis Parish was, In 1801. In 1811. For that part, which is in the Shire of Forfar - 905. 955. For that part, Avhich is in the Shire of Kincardine - 107. 97. 1012. 1052. It is 4 m. N. b. W. from Brechin. This Parish consists of three considerable Districts ; the principal one being a kind of Peninsula, formed by the two radical branches ofthe North Esk, called The East and West Waters, which here unite, and constitute what is properly styled the North Esk, a large river, separating the Shires of Forfar and Kincardine, and containing many lucrative Salmon fish ings. It is about 10 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth. The air is gener ally sharp and piercing, but not unhealthy. It would seem that the Parish had formerly been more populous than it is at present ; from the circumstance ofthe foundations of buildings being frequently found, where tliere is not now a single house : the Village of Slateford is the only one iioav remaining. The Salary of the Parochial School is \u00a318., and is numerously attended ; besides which, the inhabitants in the remote quarters employ several other teachers in the Winter season. Fuel is scarce ; the mosses being generally steep, and far distant, and even these are nearly exhausted. At Culindie are two Druidical temples, the largest ofwhich is about 45 feet by 36!: And, at Dalbog, is a third, but not so entire as the two former. The ruins of The Castle of Edzell are most magni-"], [561, "E I G ficent : tradition says, that the square Tower, which is the most ancient, was built and possessed by the Family of Stirling ; from whom it descended to the Lindsays, of Glen Esk, afterwards of Edzell, with whom it long remained, and who, as Reguli de Glen Esk, make a distinguished figure in Scottish history : This Family, like other poAverful Chieftains, possessed the power of life and death upon their estate ; and the place of execution still retains its name. This Castle, together with the greatest Part of the Parish, now belong to The Ho nourable William Maule, of Panmuir; the remaining part being the property of Sir Alexander Ramsay Irvine, Bart. EGLINTOUN, CASTLE, v. KILLWINNING. EIGG, ISLAND, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness : It is one ofthe cluster, which constitute the Parish of Small Isles : formerly a Vic arage, the Stipend of which, in 1798, was \u00a393.. 10.. 3\u00a3, being the full valued Teind ofthe Parish, and including \u00a38..6..8. for Communion elements, together with \u00a364.. 16. A-\\ by Parliamentary augmentation, and a manse, and glebe: Patron, The CroAvn : The Minister, when the weather permits, officiates in Rum, once a Month; in Muck, once a month ; in Canna, once a Quarter; and the rest of the time, in Eigg. It is in the Presbytery of Skye, and Synod of Glenelg. The Resident Population of Eigg, in 1801, was 500, and, in 1811, was 442. It is 10 m. W. from Arasaig. This Island is about 6 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth : through the middle of it there is a hollow, called, in Gaelic, Eagg, and hence it derives its name. It is principally hilly, and rocky : the hills are covered with heath, Avhich, in some places, is mixed with coarse grass : the Ioav grounds are partly deep, and partly shallow; and are tolerably productive, Avhere there is a depth of soil : about one third ofthe Island is pas ture and arable land, all the rest being moor. On the South Coast of Eigg, there is a small Island, called Eillan Chastel, Avhich is good for pasture, and a pendicle ofa contiguous Farm in Eigg: a few persons, tending cattle, live upon it during a part of the Summer months only : The Sound, between this Island and Eigg, makes a tolerable Harbour for a few vessels, not exceeding 70 tons. The air is generally moist, and the weather rainy : the climate, however, is healthy. The language, principally spoken, and universally understood, is Gaelic, and from it the names of places seem mostly to be derived. Here is a sufficiency of peats, and heath. There are various Danish Forts ; and, on the Farm of Kiell Donnain, near an old Popish Chapel, is a Barrow, which is said to be the Burial-place of Donnan, the Tutelary Saint of Eigg. There are vol, i. 3 S"], [562, "E L A numerous specimens of Basaltic pillars ; and, along the coast, rocks are found remarkably li^ht and porous, and evidently with the appearance of having undergone the operation of fire. A Parochial School was established here in 1793. The Roads are almost in a state of nature ; and there is not a Bridge in the Island. It is situate conveniently for the fishing grounds. Eigg is the pro perty of John Macdonald, Esq., of Clanronald. The inhabitants are principally Papists. Here is a Cave, in which a former generation of the Macdonalds, inhabitants of Eigg, are said to have been smothered by Macleod, of Skye. See, Rum. Scure Eigg, according to Mr. Jameson, is the highest part of the Island : this Hill, from its peculiar shape, has at a distance a singular appear ance ; but, as we approach nearer, it rises much in grandeur, and at length, a stupendous columnar Promontory bursts on our view. The Avhole ofthis Pro montory is perfectly mural, and extends for upwards of a mile and a half, and rises to the height of several hundred feet. It is entirely columnar, and the columns rise in successive ranges until they reach the summit, where, from their great height, they appear diminutive. Staffa, which is the most magnificent assemblage of natural columns that has yet been discovered, is the only one that can bear a comparison with Scure Eigg. EILDON HILLS, in the District of Melros, and Shire of Roxburgh; partly in the Parish of Melros, and partly in the Parisii of Bowden. These are three conical Hills, rising from one broad base ; the elevation of tAvo of them being about 2000 feet above the level of the sea ; but the North-East hill is chiefly noted for the vestiges ofa regularly fortified Roman camp, which communicates with other military Stations on the two other hills. General Roy has given a plan of their environs in pi. 21., and, at the bottom of them, on the Western bank ofthe Tweed, he supposes the Trimontium, of Richard of Cirencester, to have been situate. The village of Eildon is a mile and a half South- South- East from Melros. See, Melros. EILLAN CHASTEL, v. EIGG, ISLAND. EILLEAN nan EACH, v. MUCK, ISLE. ELAN A BHRIU, i. e. The Island ofthe Judge, off the Western Coast of Sutherland; and in the Parish of Edderachylis. Here the Bowels of Judge Morison, of Lewis, were interred, after his murder by Little John Mac Dhoil Mhich Huishdan; and which is the occasion of its name. It is about four acres in extent, and furnishes good pasture for lambs ; and is always possessed by the Minister of Edderachylis, by the gift of the Noble Family of Reay."], [563, "E L G ELAN A GHARIN, off the Western Coast of Sutherland ; and in the Parish of Assint. This Island belongs to the Farm of Unapool, and is appro priated to pasturage. ELAN AN DU, i. e. The Black Islands, off the Western Coast of Suther land ; and in the Parish of Assint. These Islands are of little value, and are appropriated to pasturage. They are frequented by Eagles. ELAN MHUIN, in Loch Leven According to Mr. Nimmo, in proceeding down the arm of the sea, called Loch Leven, we leave all the Islands to the County of Inverness, except Elan Mhuin. This Isle, with two rocky Islets ad joining, is the conjunct property of Cameron, of Callart, in Inverness, and Macdonald, of Glencoe, in Argyle, the rent being paid to these Proprietors alternately, and must therefore be considered as alternately in Inverness, and Argyle. ELBOTTLE, in the Shire of Hadington. It is situate on the Firth of Forth. Here was a Convent of Cistertian Nuns, which was a Cell to South Berwick. In 1646, Sir James Maxwell, Knt., of Inver wick, was created Earl of Dirleton, and Lord Elbottle, by King Charles the First : But dying without issue male, his Honours became extinct. ELCHIES, formerly MA C ALEN, in the Shire of Elgin : an ancient Vicar age, now comprehended in the Parish ofKnockando : The Church of AvhictiAvas dedicated to St. Colin. It is 11 m. S. b. W. from Fochabers. It is situate on the Western bank of the river Spey. ELCHO, CASTLE, v. RHYND. ELGAR, ISLE, one ofthe Orkneys ; and constituting part ofthe Parish of Shapinsay. Little more than a furlong to the South of the Island of Shapinsay, and separated by a reef of rocks that are almost dry at low water, is situate the beautiful Island of Elgar or Etter-Holm, which bears evident marks of having been formerly inhabited. Though some vestiges of a house are still to be seen on the North side, around which lie the lands that appear to have been cultivated,, il is probable that it has never furnished a permanent abode for men, since it was finally separated from the principal Island. At present it contains the ruins of an old Chapel, and a Pict's House that has been opened: It furnishes Pas ture for a number of sheep and young cattle in summer, and gives, by its favour able situation, the utmost security to the fine Harbour of Elwick. ELGIN, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate inthe Shire of Elgin : formerly a Rectory, and the Pastoral Charge of the Bishop of 3S2"], [564, "E L G Mory, until the year 1613 ; aster which time, a second Minister was appointed. as the Bishop's Vicar : the Stipend of each Minister, in 1811, being 104 bolls of bear, but the actual payments are only 103 bolls 2 pecks ; the money Stipend to each, is \u00a349.. 9.. 0. Sterling, in Avhich are included \u00a36. as the rent of half of the glebe, and \u00a32..2..0. as each Minister's share of the rent of the ground for a manse, and garden ; but from this sum is to be deducted Ils. ld. as the Vicar- age of The College, which does not noAV exist : there is no manse, though the ground for building upon, had been set apart, with a suitable garden : the Vicarage of Pluscarden, converted at \u00a3 100. , is allowed for Communion elements : The CroAvn is Patron of both these Benefices : The Church of St. Giles, being an old vaulted fabric, fell down in 1679, and was soon after re-built in the style in which it now appears. It is in the Presbytery of Elgin, and Synod of Moray. The Resident Population ofthis ToAvn, and Parish, in 1801, Avas4345, and, in 1811, was 4602. It is 167 m. N. from Edinburgh. A General Post- Office is established here. The Market is on Friday. The Fairs are holden on the Thursday before Easter, the 4th Tuesday, in May, the last Tuesday in July, the second Tuesday in October, and the second Tuesday in December. At what time Elgin was erected into a Royal Borough, does not appear : the oldest Charter extant, is from Alexander the Second, in 1234, Avho granted to the Burgesses of Elgyn, a Guild of Merchants, with as extensive privileges as any other Borough enjoys in Scotland : In 1633, Charles the First established and confirmed all the Grants of his Royal predecessors, in favour ofthe Borough ; and the Set or Form of its government, was ratified by the Convention of Royal Boroughs, in 1706. Elgin, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of Banff, Cullen, Kintore, and Inver-Ury, send one Member to Parliament. It is a good Town, pleasantly situate on the South bank ofthe small river Lossie: and the Harbour of Lossiemouth, which is the property ofthe Borough, admits vessels of 80 tons burden at Spring tides. The whole Revenue of the Town amounts to about \u00a3200. per annum. The Parish of Elgin extends about 10 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth. The surface is flat, rising gently towards the Black- Hills ; the soil is various ; being in some parts a rich loam , in others a clay , but, in general, it is sandy, abounding Avith calcareous particles, and, on the whole, is fertile, producing plenty of grain, and of good quality. In 1224, the Cathedral Church of the Diocese of Moray was translated from the Church of The Holy Trinity at Spynie, by Bishop Andrew, to Elgin : when a new Cathe dral Church was begun to be built here ; and which, in 1390, after it had stood"], [565, "ELG 166 years, was, together with the Avhole Town, burned down by Alexander Earl of Buchan, deservedly called The Wolf of Badenoch. About the year 1897, it was begun to be re-built, but it was not finished until aster the year 1414 : from the ruins, which still remain, it appears to have been a large and splendid edifice, in the Gothic style of architecture, 264 feet in length, and 35 feet in breadth, and was not surpassed in beauty, by any building of that nature in Scotland. The College, when at Spynie, consisted of a Dean, Chancellor, Arch-deacon, Chanter, Treasurer, and eight Canons, instituted by Bishop Bricius ; but, on the Translation, the Canons Avere increased to Twenty-two. The Precinct here was walled round Avith a strong stone wall, four yards high, and nine hundred in circuit ; within which stood the Cathedral, and the Canons' Houses: these have noAV come into Lay hands, but several ofthe Manses are in habited, and are distinguished by the names of the Canonry to which they be longed. The Cathedral, as well as that of Aberdeen, was destroyed for the sake ofthe lead that covered the roof; which Avas done in 1567, by order of Council, to support the soldiery ofthe Regent Murray. \" I hope,\" says Dr. Johnson, \" every reader will rejoice that this cargo of sacrilege was lost at sea.\" Mr. Grose has preserved two views of this building. In the reign of William the Ldon, there was a Royal Fort on an eminence, now called Lady-Hill, the ruins ofwhich are still visible. The two most considerable Heritors are, The Earl of Fife, and The Earl of Moray. Here is a Grammar School, with a Salary of \u00a321. Sterling ; and also a School for teaching English and Music, endoAved by James the Sixth out ofthe Revenues ofthe Preceptory of Maison Dieu : and the Magistrates, and several respectable Inhabitants, laudably desirous to promote the education of Youth, have very liberally begun an Academy on an extensive plan. Elgin and Kincardine give the title of Earl to the Ancient and Noble Family of Bruce. Here was a Convent of Dominicans, founded in 1233, or 1234, by Alexander the Second ; and another ofthe Observantines, founded in 1479, by John Innes. See, Inverness. ELGIN, or MORAY, SHIRE. This Shire formerly comprehended the Shires of Nairn, Moray Proper or Elgin, and a great part ofthe Shire of Banff. Its boundaries, except along the shore of the Moray Firth, seem to have been deter mined by Political and Ecclesiastical considerations, rather than by natural limits, as it is in many places intersected by parts of the Shires of Inverness, Nairn, and Banff. This was anciently esteemed the Granary of Scotland ; and Whitelock, in his \" Memorial,\" edit. London, 1732 p. 517, says \" Ashfield's"], [566, "ELL regiment Avas marched into Murray Land, which is the most fruitful country in Scotland ; and tlie common proverb is, that it hath fis \"teen days more of Summer than any other part of the Nation.\" The Resident Population of this Shire, in 1801, was 26,705, and, in 1811, was 28,108. It sends one Member to Parlia ment. This was formerly a Bishoprick, the Cathedral being at Elgin, and the Episcopal residence at Spynie. It is now a Synod, comprehending also a con siderable part of the Shire of Inverness. It is watered by the Findhorn, the Lossie, and the Spey, Avhich afford valuable salmon fishings. Moray gives the title of Earl, to the Ancient and Illustrious family of Stuart. The Moray Firth is a considerable inlet of the German Ocean, with safe anchorage, and is the \u00c6stuarium Vararis, of ancient Geographers. ELIBANK, in the Shire of Selkirk : and in the Parish of Yarrow. It is situate on the South bank of the river Tweed, at the distance of 8 miles North- West from Selkirk. In 1613, the faithful Sir Gideon Murray, rose to be a Lord of Session, by the title of Lord Elibank : and, in 1643, Elibank furnished a Baronial title to Sir Patrick Murray ; whose worthy and Noble descendant, Alexander Lord Elibank, is now Lord Lieutenant ofthe Shire of Peebles. ELL AM, or ELD-HAM, in the Shire of Berwick : an ancient Rectory, and Parish, now comprehended in the Parish of Longfor-Macus. The ruins of the ancient Church, and the Hamlet of Ellam, stand on the North side of the river Whittadder, near a ford, whence the place has been recently called Ellam Ford. The old Church was still used, for Spiritual rites, during the reign of Charles the First. See, Longfor-Macus. ELLER-HOLM, v. ELGAR, ISLE. ELLIOCK, v. SANQUHAR. ELLON, in the District of Ellon, and Shire of Aberdeen : formerly a Pre bend, in the Church of Aberdeen ; the Stipend of which, in 1811, was one chalder of bear, one chalder of meal, 1000 merks in money, and \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements : the manse is in tolerable repair : the glebe is scarcely legal, but is good land : Patron, The Honourable William Gordon : The Church is in decent condition. It is in the Presbytery of Ellon, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 2022, and, in 1811, was 2194. It is 138 m. N. b. E. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is estab lished here. This Parish is about 9 miles in length, and 5 miles in breadth, being intersected by the river Ythan, which is navigable for Lrge boats, at high tides, within a short distance ofthe Town. The surface is uneven, but the hills are"], [567, "ELY inconsiderable, and are generally covered with heath. In the low grounds, the soil is dry, and fertile ; but, in the Northern parts, it is wet and mossy. There is a valuable salmon fishery in the Ythan, which also abounds with trout and eels, and a species of the pearl shell fish. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a dwelling-house and garden ; and 100 merks from the Proprietor of the estate of Watertown. Fuel is expensive. The roads, and bridges, are in good repair. The Fairs are holden on the first Tuesdays, O. S., in May, and June, the third Tuesday, O. S., in August, and the First Tuesday, O. S., in November. ELPHINSTONE, v. DUNMORE. ELPHINGSTONE, in the Shire of Hadington ; and in the Parish of Tranent. A village, at the distance of 3 m. S. S.W. from Tranent.

A General Post-Office is established here. This Town is plea santly built on a dry and healthy situation, upon the Northern shore ofthe Firth of Forth, and is a well frequented Sea-bathing place. It was erected into a Royal Borough, by a Charter from Malcolm the Second, but was disfranchised of its Parliamentary Representation, On account of its inability to support its Members. It has an excellent Harbour, very easy of access, and perfectly safe ; but the head ofthe Quay was lately demolished by a high tide and storm, and, although it is the only Port in the mouth ofthe Firth, where vessels bound out wards can find shelter in an Easterly storm, it will remain in a ruinous state unless some assistance is granted from the Public purse. Coals are the common fuel. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, and perquisites. Ely was disjoined from the extensive Parish of Killconquhar, and made a distinct Parish about the year 1640 : and part of it still lies in the very centre of Kill-"], [568, "E N H couquhar, from the circumstance, that, at the disjunction, the Proprietor of Ely wished all the lands belonging to that Barony to be in the neAV Parish. It is about a mile and a half iu length, and a mile in breadth, and is all inclosed. Sir John Anstruther, Bart., who has an elegant Mansion here, called Ely- House, is sole Proprietor of the Parish, except one Farm, lately purchased by J. Cabstairs Bruce, of Balchristie. EMANUEL, or MANUEL PRIORY, in the Shire of Stirling ; and in the Parish of Muir- Avon-Side. This Priory is situate on the West bank of the Avater of Avon, about half a mile above LinlithgoAv Bridge. It Avas founded about the year 1156, by King Malcolm the Fourth, surnamed The Maiden, and was a Priory occupied by Nuns of the Bernardine or Cistertian Order. Besides the endowments bestoAved by the Royal Founder, it received considerable dona tions from others at different periods. The Prioress of this House SAvore fealty to Edavard the First, on the 28th of July, 1291 ; as did Alice, her Successor, at LinlithgoAv, in 1296. Ofthis Nunnery little now remains, except the West end of the Church. It is of hewn stone, but unadorned ; yet there is an elegant simplicity in it, and with the beauty of the surrounding objects, makes a very picturesque appearance. This Priory came into the hands of the Crown, by the forfeiture of The Earl of Callander and Linlithgow in 1715, to whose prede cessor it had been given some time after the Reformation. It is noAv the pro perty of William Forbes, Esq., of Callander. Mr. Grose has preserved a VieAv of it. EMBO, in the Shire of Sutherland ; and in the Parisii of Dornoch. It is 2\u00a3 m. N. from Dornoch. Here is the seat of the Knights of Embo. It is situate near a small Bay, to Avhich it gives name, on the German Ocean. Here a severe battle Avas fought in 1259, between William Earl of Sutherland and the Danes, in which the latter were overthrown, and their General slain. ENHALLOW, ISLAND, one ofthe Orkneys ; and constituting* part ofthe Parish of Rousay. It is separated by a reef of rocks from Rousay, which, being covered at high water, have unfortunately sometimes proved fatal to the unwary mariner. The Sound ofthis name is on the South, between it and the Island of Pomona, and is safe for those Avho are acquainted with it ; but, as it is narroAV, and the tide rapid, it should only be attempted with a fair wind, and in moderate weather. This is a low, and very small Island, being little more than a mile in circumference : the soil is good, but is very unskilfully cultivated. It is inhabited by two Families only. There are no mice here."], [569, "ERR ENSAY, ISLAND, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness : it constitutes part of the Parish of Harris. This Island is about 2 miles long, and one mile broad: it is verdant all over, and has a good soil, which is well cultivated. ENTERKINE, v. TARBOLTON. ENZIE, v. RATHVEN.

STRATH-GLASS. ERES, ST., KIRK, in the Shire of Caithness : and in the Parish of Wick. It is situate a little below Ackergill Tower. The Chapel is in ruins ; but some old people, even until very lately, were so superstitious, that they thought it their duty to retire thither for their devotions, and there leave small gifts of bread and cheese, and other trifles. ERISKAY, ISLAND, one of the Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness : it constitutes part of the Parish of South Uist. It is a small Island, and is noted for having* been the first place on which The Pretender landed, in his Avild attempt to regain the British Crown in 1745. The fishery, kelp, pasturage, and a little tillage, are the means it presents for the maintenance of its inhabitants. ERROL, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend ofwhich, in 1811, was \u00a3150., and \u00a38..6..8. for Communion elements : the manse is old, but in tolerable condition: the glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Patron, John Allen, Esq., of Errol : The Church Avas built in 1765.

A General Post-Office is established here. The village of Errol is pleasantly situate on an eminence, rising by a gradual aseent above the level of the country, and commanding a most extensive and delightful prospect. The Parish contains about 7000 acres of rich, and Avell cultivated land ; com prising a considerable portion of the Carse of Gowrie. It was long in the possession ofthe Hays, by a grant for their signal service, in the defeat of the Danes about the year 980 ; but has since passed to several proprietors. The climate is damp. Coals are the common fuel. The want of good water is a great inconvenience. From the shore of Errol, on the Northern bank of the vol. i. 3 T"], [570, "ESK Firth of Tay, large quantities of grain are exported: here the Proprietor receives a duty upon the articles shipped off, or landed ; and a passage-boat goes regu larly from hence, and the shore of Newburgh, every tide. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, besides School-fees, and perquisites, amounting, in the Avhole, to about \u00a350. Sterling per annum. Errol gives the title of Earl to the Ancient and Noble Family of Carr, Lord Hay, Hereditary Lord High Constable, and Knight Marischal of Scotland. ERSKINE, in the Shire of Renfrew : formerly a Rectory, and a Prebend of the Cathedral Church of Glasgow ; the Stipend ofwhich, in 1811, was 110 bolls and one firlot of oat-meal, and \u00a325.. 18.. 2 \\ in money : the manse is in good repair: the glebe consists of between 5 and 6 acres of arable land : Patron, Lord Blantyre : The Church is in tolerable condition, but is about to be rebuilt.

In the Eastern part ofthe Parish are Quarries of free-stone ; two of which were worked for The Great Canal, and for building new and commodious Quays at the Ferry. The East Ferry, or Ferry of Erskine, across the Clyde, is nearly opposite to the village of West Kill-Patrick, and is used for transporting horses and carriages, as well as foot passengers : The West Ferry is opposite to the Castle of Dumbarton, and is chiefly used for foot passengers. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees and perquisites, and a free house, and garden. The great road, from Glasgow to Greenock, passes through the Parish. The first fine thread manufactured in the Kingdom, was by Mrs. Christian Shaw, of Bargarron, about the beginning of the Eighteenth Century; and this trade has been kept up in the neighbourhood ever since. The Castle of Erskine, formerly the property ofthe Erskines, of that Ilk, after passing into the hands of various families, is now one ofthe Seats ofthe Ancient and Noble Family of Stewart, Lord Blantyre, a distinguished Officer in the army. The House has been modernized at different times, and is beautifully situate on the South bank of the Clyde, on a fine lawn, adorned with many stately old trees, and thriving modern plantations. ESK-DALE, a District so called, in the Shire of Dumfries. It takes its name from the river Esk, which flows through it, and was formerly a Lordship"], [571, "ESK or Barony in the family of Maxwell ; but Avas attainted, in 1715, on account of their attachment to the House of Stuart. Here are various Roman remains. ESK-DALE-MUIR, in the Shire of Dumfries : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150.: the manse is in good order: the glebe consists of about 24 acres, but, from the nature ofthe climate, it is not very pro ductive: Patron, The Duke of Buccleugh: The Church was built about the year 1722. It is in the Presbytery of Langholm, aud Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population ofthis Parishj in 1801, was 537, and, in 1811, was 581. It is 13 m. N. W. from Langholm. This Parish is 11^ miles in length, and about 8 miles in breadth. It was originally a part ofthe Parish of Wester-Kirk ; but, in 1703, was erected into a separate Parish by the present name. The princi pal rivers are, The White and Black Esks, Avhich run to the Southward, and meet at the extremity ofthe Parish, forming the well known river of Esk, which discharges itself into the Sohvay Firth. The most remarkable hills are, The Pen of Esk-Dale-Muir, and Loch-Fell. The soil is, in general, very deep, but, owing to its elevated situation, not very fertile : most part of it is moss, covered with a coarse kind of grass : along the banks of The White Esk, however, the hills are for the most green, and afford excellent pasture. The air is damp ; but, since the introduction of draining, the healthiness of the place is greatly improved. The principal production of the Parisii is sheep. The fuel commonly used is peats, which may be procured in great quantities ; but, it is often difficult from the wetness of the seasons, to get them dried : the nearest coal is in Canoby, at the distance of 18 miles. The Roads, and Bridges, are in excellent repair. On the farm of Yetbyre, is a very complete encampment, of an oval form, called Castle- O'er, or Overbie: the general opinion is, that it is a Roman camp which communicated with those of Middlebie and Netherbie, and that the difference of shape may have been occasioned by the situation ; it being placed upon the sum mit of a hill, where the rectangular form could not be adhered to: and the name of Overbie, or Upper Station, favours this opinion : There is scarcely a hill within sight of it, on which there is not some vestige of an outer encampment : from Castle- O'er, a communication by encampments of this kind can easily be traced down the Esk to Netherbie, on the one hand ; and, on the other, doAvn The Water of Milk to Middlebie. A Roman Road has also been traced from Nether bie to near Langholm ; and there are reports of its having been discovered at the head ofthis Parish, near the Farm-house of Over- Causeway, immediately oppo site to which are the vestiges of a pretty strong outer station. On the Farm of 3T2"], [572, "ESS Coatt, there are two Druidical circles ; one of them measuring about 90 feet ; and the other, a part of it being Avorn aAvay by the Esk, measuring about 340 feet. The piece of ground, at the junction ofthe Black and White Esks, Avas formerly remarkable for an annual Fair that had been holden there for time im memorial, but Avhich is iioav entirely laid aside. At that Fair, it was the Custom for the unmarried persons of both sexes to choose a companion, according to their fancy, with whom they were to live until that time the next year : this was called Hand-fasting , or Hand in fist: If they Avere pleased Avith each other after twelve months experience, then they continued together for life ; if not, they sepa rated, and Avere free to make another choice, as on the first occasion : the fruit of their connexion (if any) was always attached to the disaffected person. In later times, Avhen this part ofthe country belonged to the Abbey of Melrose, a Priest, to whom they gaA'e the name of Book i bosom (either because he carried in his bosom a bible, or, perhaps, a register ofthe marriages) came from time to time to confirm the marriages. \" This place,\" adds The Reverend William Brown, \" is only a small distance from the Roman encampment of Castle-O'er. May not the Fair have been instituted, when the Romans resided tliere? and may not the Hand-fasting have taken its rise from their manner of celebrating marriage, ex usu, by which, if a woman, with the consent of her parents or guardians, lived with a man for a year, Avithout being absent for three nights, she became his wife 1 Perhaps, Avhen Christianity Avas introduced, this form of marriage may have been looked upon as imperfect, without confirmation by a Priest, and, therefore, one may have been sent from time to time for this purpose.\" \u2014 Persons of high rank are said to have taken the benefit ofthis custom ; for Lindesey, in his reign of James the Second, says, \" That James Sixth Earl of Murray begat upon Isabel Innes, daughter ofthe Laird of Innes, Alexaner Dunbar, a man of sin gular Avit and courage. This Isabel was but handfist with him, and deceased before the marriage ; where-through this Alexander he Avas worthy of a greater living, than he might succeed to by the laAvs and practices of this Realm.\" \u2014 General Roy has given a plan pi. 26. of Castle Over, Avhich he supposes to have been the ad Uxellam amnem Statio, of Richard of Cirencester. It is situate on a high point ofland, formed by the junction ofthe Black and White Esks. ESSIE, v. RHYNIE. ESSIE, or EASSIE, in the Shire of Forfar : formerly a Rectory, with the Parish of Nevay united, prior to the middle of the Seventeenth Century : the Stipend ofwhich, in 1811, was 5s chalders of victual, and \u00a360. Sterling, toge-"], [573, "ESS ther with \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements : the manse, and offices, are in good condition : the glebe consists of 5j acres : Patron, The Honourable James Stewart Wortley Mackenzie : The Church is a small, mean building, and in bad repair. It is in the Presbytery of Meigle, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population ofthe United Parishes, in 1801, was 638, and, in 1811, was 676. The Church is 2 m. W. from Glammis. These Parishes occupy part ofthe Northern declivity ofthe Sidlaic Hills, and part of the Valley of Strath more, and contain about 5120 square acres ; more than two-thirds ofwhich are well cultivated, and inclosed. The soil is various, being a fertile loam on the higher grounds, and a mixture of clay and sand in the Valley. The climate is genial, and the seasons are early. This Parish is bounded, on the North, by the river Dean, which is famous for the excellence of its trout ; and it is watered by two of its tributary streams, that rise in the Sidlaw Hills, and, in their course, drive several Mills for the threshing and grinding of corn. The Parish of Essie is divided among five Proprietors, none of whom are resident. Fuel is scarce, and dear, being chiefly coals from Dundee, at the distance of 14 miles. The roads are in tolerable repair. The Parochial School, and dwelling, are new and large, and are conveniently situate near the centre of the District, about two miles South-West from the Church : the Salary, and fees, amounting to about \u00a350. Sterling per annum. At Castle- Town, on the side of the great road to Aberdeen, are the vestiges of a large encampment, which is supposed to have been occupied by the army of Edward the First, as some coins of that Monarch have been discovered in the area : Two sides of the fosse are still entire, the situation ofthe draw-bridge, on the South side, is also discernible, and from the top of the mound (which is evidently artificial), the view of the surrounding country is very extensive. Near the Church of Essie, and close to the road side, there is a laro-e stone, covered with Hieroglyphieal sculpture : on one side, is a large ornamented cross, with the figures of huntsmen, dogs, and a stag ; on the other side, are represented three pilgrims walking in procession, three oxen, an angel, and two other figures, probably referring to an entertainment. There is no tradition concerning this stone ; but it is conjectured, that it may have been erected to commemorate a hunting match, and feast, attended with some Reli gious ceremony. The modern improvements in agriculture were introduced into this Parish, at a very early period ; and the Farmers are equally enterprising with those of any other district in the Kingdom. ESSIL, in the Shire of Elgin : an ancient Parish, now comprehended in the"], [574, "E T T Parish of Speymouth : The Church, which is now demolished, was dedicated to St. Peter ; but the Church-yard, is still in use.

This was the Seat of the Sub-Treasurer of Moray. ETHIE HOUSE, and HAVEN, v. INVER-KEILOR. ETTERICK, in the Shire of Selkirk : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., together with a manse, and glebe: Patron, Lord Napier. It is in the Presbytery of Selkirk, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 445, and, in 1811, was 440. It is 16 m. S. W. from Selkirk. This Parish extends about 10 miles in every direction. The soil in the vallies is deep and fertile ; which is in a great mea sure formed by the rich particles of earth brought down from the hills, and depo sited by the waters : but, notAvithstanding this fertility, very few good crops are raised, owing to the great elevation of the country, and the frequency of the rains which prevent the crops from coming to maturity : upon the hills, the soil is in many places mossy, and only fit for fuel, and pasturage. The air is in general moist ; yet it does not appear to be unfavourable to health, from the length of life which the inhabitants attain to. The Mountains are principally lofty ; the most remarkable being those, called the Ward Law, and Etterick Pen; the former rising 1980 feet, and the latter 2200, above the level of the Sea. The number of Sheep reared in this Parish is about 30,000. There are two Lochs adjoining to one another, partly in this Parish, and partly in that of Yarrow : one of them is called The Loch ofthe Loices, and the other, St. Mary's Loch: the extent of the former is inconsiderable : the latter is about three miles in length, and, in some parts, about one mile in breadth. The fish, with which they chiefly abound, are Pike and Perch : no person, however, pays attention to them. The Etterick is the only river in this Parish : it is small, but abounds with excellent trout : after a course of 30 miles to the Eastward, in which it passes through the Parishes of Etterick, Yarrow, and Selkirk, it is absorbed in the Tweed, some miles above Melros. In former times, this part of the Country abounded Avith wood; from whence it received the name, which it still retains, of Etterick Forest: not a vestige, however, of the ancient wood now remains: but, as great quantities of Oak are occasionally dug up in the mosses, that seems to have been the prevalent species. The roads are bad ; and the want of Bridges is a great inconvenience. The snow falls here, at times, so deep, as to obstruct"], [575, "E V I for many months the usual intercourse Avith the adjacent Parishes. The fuel used here is peat ; coal is distant 30 miles. Although the Etterick, a sAveet pastoral Stream, is not so celebrated in Scottish lyricks, as the Yarrow, and the Tweed; yet \" Etterick Banks\" have not been quite forgotten, in the \" enrap raptur'd Shepherd's Song.\" According to Mr. Chalmers, the present Parish of Etterick includes, on the East, the old Parish of Buccleugh, whose Church may still be traced on the Rankle Burn. In the South-West part ofthis Parish, there was of old a Church in a small valley, which was called Kirk-Hope, through which Kirk- Hope Burn ran to the Etterick: And, in the North-West corner of this Parish, there was once a Chapel, which stood, at no great distance from the South-West corner of The Loch ofthe Lowes, in a small valley, called from it, Chapel-Hope : and which was probably subordinate to the Mother Church of St. Mary, in the Parish of Yarrow. In 1639, Patrick Ruthven, who had learned the art of war under the great Gustavus, was created Lord Etterick. It afterwards gave the title of Baron to the family of Douglas, now extinct. ETTLETON, in the District of Castletown, and Shire of Roxburgh : for merly a Rectory and Vicarage, valued at \u00a32.. 13. .4. : the Church-yard is still in use. It is situate on the West side of the river Liddal, at the Southern end of the dale, and now constitutes part ofthe Parish of Castle-Town. See, Castle- Town. EVIE, in the Island of Pomona, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shetland: formerly a Rectory, united to the ancient Vicarage of Rendal ; the Stipend of which, according to a modification ofthe 4th of February 1801 , was \u00a341.. 14.. 9. in money, including \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements, 10 meils of malt, 11 meils of oat-meal, and 143 meils of bear, but the question as to the Excise duty on malt, being deducted by the Tacksman, occurs here : there are three glebes, one of them near the Church of Rendal ; a very good one near the manse, but, like the other farms, in detached parcels ; and a third, in the North end of Evie, two miles from the manse : of this last, the whole victual rent, and for which the Minister is accountable, is payable to Lord Armadale, in name of Teinds : the yearly value of all the glebes, and a lispond of butter, payable out of a small farm in the Parish of Birsa, is about \u00a320. Sterling ; there are also manufactured on the shores of these glebes, nearly two tons of kelp yearly ; the manse was built, in 1784: Patron, Lord Dundas : both the Churches are ruinous, and Di vine Service has been performed for some years past, in the open air. It is in the Presbytery of Kirkwall, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population of"], [576, "E V I the Parish of Evie, in 1801, was 812, and, in 1811, was 677. It is 18 m. N. N. W. from Kirkwall. The United Parishes of Evie and Rendal extend along the shores ofthe Mainland to the distance often miles in length, and from one to tAvo in breadth, containing a large quantity of fine land, equally fit for raising corn, and for pasturage. Situate on a gentle declivity toward the North, and in the neighbourhood of the shores, where there is no want of excellent mate rials, they might be inclosed and improAed at a moderate expense, and with advantage to the Proprietors. They are, notwithstanding, in the same state Avith other Parishes, whose circumstances and situation are less favourable ; much of the land is runrig ; the grass is common to many of the adjoining tenants ; and the houses are both poor in themselves, and situate with very little regard to convenience. Even Aikerness, the Seat of one of the principal Proprietors, though pleasantly situate by the sea-side, in the midst ofa large extent of fine ground, is in a degree of cultivation not much superior to the little farms adjacent: this beautiful spot has, on one hand of it, a Bay of the same name, where ships of 200 tons burden may find convenient anchorage ; and, on the other, a pleasant Lake of deep water now partly drained, and skirted with coarse grass, to which the Lapwing, Gull, Coot, and dusky Grobe resort in summer in vast numbers, for the purpose of incubation. The Hills, which are mostly Common, support 3000 sheep, which are at all times suffered to roam at large Avithout a Shep herd ; and even the Swine, which are known to be so pernicious to fields of every sort, are under no more restraint, though their number exceeds five hun dred. The Cattle and Horses, Avhich these Parishes maintain, are in proportion. The arable ground amounts to 1200 planks, each containing forty fathoms square; that which is in pasture, is four times the same quantity; and the Rental ofthe Avhole, exclusively ofthe kelp shores, which produce tAventy tons of kelp annually, is very little less than \u00a3800. Sterling. The Inhabitants are em ployed variously ; some few of them being tradesmen, some sailors, none of them fishers by profession, though their situation is favourable for this employment; and, however unproductive their labour may be, they are almost all of them some way or other employed in the cultivation of the land. Many excellent fish, such as Cod, Ling, Dog-fish, Haddocks, Skate, Holibut, Sillocks, and Cooths or the Coal-fish, of different ages, frequent these Coasts, and are sometimes caught when the weather permits, or when the people find leisure, or are prompted by want or inclination. Few places, when all circumstances are considered, seem more favourable than this for a Fishing Station. Along the shores of Evie there"], [577, "EYE are several of those ancient monuments, known by the name of Picts' Houses, as well as in other Parishes similarly situate. Some Tumuli or Barrows are likeAvise to be seen ; but all these, and also the Church of St. Nicholas, have now ceased to exhibit the property, which, according to Dr. Wallace, they formerly had, of nocturnal Illumination. Almost all the lands pay a feu-duty ; and some of them a very heavy one, to Lord Dundas, as Representative of the Crown in the Earldom, or as Tacksman of the Bishoprick of Orkney. The climate is healthy. The Society for propagating Christian Knowledge have established a School here, Avith a Salary of \u00a312. per annum, and which is well conducted by a very meritorious School-master : but the School-house is a bad one. The principal Heritors are Lord Armadale, and John Traill, Esq., of Woodwick ; but neither of them are Resident. The spacious old Mansion House at Aiker ness, is rapidly going to decay. EWES, in the Shire of Dumfries : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of Avhich, in 1811, was 3 chalders of victual, two of them payable in meal and one in bar ley, and \u00a347. in money, together with \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements : the manse is in bad repair : the glebe consists of 31 acres : Patron, The Duke of Buccleugh : The Church is old, and in bad condition. It is in the Presbytery of Langholm, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 358, and, in 1811, was 338. It is 4 m. N. from Langholm. This Parish is about 8 miles in length, and 5\\ miles in breadth, and is watered by the Ewes, a tributary stream of the Esk. The surface is hilly, and is principally appropriated to the pasturage of sheep. The climate is damp, but not unhealthy. The great Turnpike Roads, which were made by Act of Parliament, are in good repair. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School fees, and some small emoluments, a dwelling, and a rood ofland. EYEBROUGHY, v. IBRIS. EYE MOUTH, in the Shire of Berwick : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., being paid partly by victual and money, and partly from teinds of fish, together with a glebe of about 10 acres of good land : Patron, The Crown : The Church, and manse, are in bad repair. It is in the Presbytery of Chirnside, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. This Parish is about a mile square, including the Farm of Highlaws, but its marches, with those of Coldingham, are indented, and very irregular: the soil is good, and produces every sort of grain, of an excellent quality. The climate is dry, and healthy. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 899, and, in 1811, was 962. It is 2 m. N. E. from Ayton.

Before the Reformation, it is said, that the Prior of Coldingham had a Chapel of Ease here, and that it was erected into a Parish, no sooner than in the reign of King James the Sixth. At the beginning of the last Century, Eyemouth was a small fishing Village, which afforded a retreat for Smugglers ; but, shortly after The Union, that pernicious trade being nearly abolished, the Gentlemen of the County took advantage ofthe excellent natural harbour, formed by the river Eye, and, about the year 1750, erected a Pier on the West side, by voluntary Subscription ; and, about the year 1770, another Pier was built on the East side of the Harbour, which was planned and executed by Mr. Smeaton, who conceived an high opinion ofthe advantageous situation : it lies at the corner ofa Bay, in Avhich ships can Avork in and out at all times of tide, or lie at anchor secure from all winds, except the Northerly and North Easterly : in such cases, the Harbour can easily be taken, and vessels of small burden lie in safety, defended from the violence of the sea by the Northern Pier. Since the erection of the Harbour, the trade of the Town has much increased : but this Port being a branch ofthe Custom-house of Dunbar, and the Merchants being obliged to go there, a distance of 20 miles, on all Custom-house business, is a great inconvenience to its Commerce. The coast abounds with a great variety of excellent fish ; and the herring fishery in particular is prosecuted here with much success. Coals are the only fuel used here. Upon a small Promon tory stretching out into the Sea, are the remains ofa regular Fortification, Avhich is said to have been erected by The Earl of Hertford, aftenvards Duke of Somerset, when he invaded Scotland, in the Minority of Edward the Sixth. It was demolished by Treaty, in the reign of Queen Mary, soon after the battle of Pinkie. Though all the rocks along the coast are ofthe common hard whin-stone, yet this Promontory consists of Avhat is called Pudding-stone : it is remarkably hard, and the two Piers which are built of it, stand both the weather and water without the least appearance of Avaste. A chalder of barley, of the victual Sti pend of Swinton, is paid out of this Estate. The celebrated John Churchill, who rose by his address and valour to be Duke of Marlborough, and Prince of Mindelheim, was created Lord Eyemouth, in 1682.

A considerable part of those astonishing improA*ements, which have lately been made in this Parish, and in the adjoining country, have been owing to The Great Canal, which is cut from the Firth of Forth to the river Clyde. As Scotland is almost divided into two parts by this Firth and River, an idea, as early as the reign of Charles the Second, was entertained of opening a communication between the Eastern and the Western Seas, throu\u00b0*h the medium ofa Canal : this intention was afterwards repeatedly renewed, and surveys were taken : after various attempts, a Bill was sanctioned by Parliament, and, on the 10th of July 1768, this great work Avas begun under the direction of Mr. Smeaton, and, finally completed under the conduct of Mr. Robert Whitworth, on the 28th of July 1790, when the Navigation between the German and the Atlantic Oceans was opened, amidst the shouts and appro bation of an astonished multitude.

In the Barony of Seabegs, near the Canal, is an artificial mound of earth, where Courts and deliberative Councils were formerly holden, as appears by the name Mote, which the place yet retains ; and, at this spot, is also a small Burying-ground, where there was a Roman"], [582, "FAL Catholic Chapel.

But the most prominent feature of Antiquity in this Parish, is the Roman Wall, which was built in the reign ofthe Emperor Antoninus Pius, under the direction of his Lieutenant Lollius Urbicus : it in general follows the track, where Agricola had previously erected a chain of Forts, extending from the Firth of Forth to the river Clyde, and was about 40 Roman, or 37 English miles in length. This Wall, or rather defensive work, consisted of a Ditch on the North, and a Wall on the South ; the Ditch varies as to its breadth, but is never less than 12 or 15 feet wide, and the Wall, which was of turf, Avas about 12 feet thick at the foundation. Much light has been thrown on the history of this Wall by the inscribed stones that have been dug up in various parts of it ; and from these it appears, that the Wall was chiefly made by the Second and Twentieth Legions, and the Vexillations of the Sixth and Twentieth, together with a Cohort of Auxiliaries. This Rampart is denominated by Buchanan, The Wall of Severus*. other Writers have also given it the same name ; but though it may have been repaired by Severus, yet the Wall Avhich he built, was not in this district of the country, but was drawn betAveen the Solway Firth and Newcastle upon Tyne. Tlte Wall of Antoninus is generally known in this country by the Name of Graham's Dyke : some persons are of opinion, that it derived this appellation from a powerful leader of that name, who broke through this famous line of defence, and routed the Britons on the South side of it, who were then abandoned by the Romans: others affirm, that in the reign of Malcolm the Second, one Gryme, who was connected with the Royal Family, aspiring to the throne, drew together some followers, and in order to settle the commotion, the Pretender got a grant, for the term of his life, of all that part of Malcolm's kingdom which was on the North side of the Wall, and that the line of separa tion was, from this event, called Gryme' s Dyke, and hence, by an easy transition, Graham's Dyke. Along the South side of this Wall, a CauseAvay was formed, for the more expeditious and commodious travelling ofthe Soldiers from one part of it to another. FALKLAND, anciently KILLGOUR, in the District of Cupar, and Shire of Fife : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, Avas 4 chalders of bear, 2 chalders of meal, and 600 merks, together with \u00a38.. 6.. 8. for Communion elements ; a glebe has been obtained, and an excellent manse recently built : Patron, Mr. Thomson, of Balniel : The Church is in good repair.

It Avas erected into a Burgh of Regality by-King James the Second in 1458, and its Charter was renewed by King James the Sixth in 1595. The Government is vested in 3 Baillies, 15 Counsellors one of whom is Treasurer, and a Town Clerk, avIio are self-elected. The Revenue of the Burgh, arising from Customs at Markets, landed property, and a Mill, is upwards of \u00a3100. per annum. The Town is very irregular, and poorly built ; but is plen tifully supplied with fine water, introduced by leaden pipes in 1781. A General Post-Office is established here. The principal Manufacture is that of coarse linens. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School fees, and perquisites. The Parish of Falkland contains about 10,000 acres. The surface is much diversified : and the soil is partly a light loam, and partly a deep black moss. About one half of the Parish may be considered as pasture ground, in which is included the Easter Lomond, and that part of the Western which lies within the Parish, both of which are a Commonty to the contiguous Heritors, and tHe Town of Falkland. The climate is healthy. Free-stone, and muir-stone, of good quality, are in abundance. The Palace of Falkland, now in ruins, was one ofthe seats ofthe Macduffs, Earls of Fife : On the attainder of Murdo Stuart Duke of Albany, the Seventeenth Earl, it became forfeited to the Crown in 1424. James the Fifth, Avho was very fond of the place, enlarged and improved it ; and the remains evince its former magnificence and elegance, and the fine taste of the princely architect. This Palace Avas also a favourite residence of James the Sixth, on account ofthe fine Park, and plenty of Deer. The East side was acci dentally burned in the time of Charles the Second, and the Park ruined during Cromwell's Usurpation, when the fine Oaks were cut down in order to build the Fort at Perth. The family of Skene, of Hallyards, are now the Heritable Keepers ofthe Palace of Falkland. In the old Castle, David Duke of Rothesay, son to Robert the Third, was cruelly starved, by the villainy of his Uncle The Duke of Albany.

This Parish is 30 computed miles in length, and 14 miles in breadth. The surface is mountainous, and rocky : the soil is, in general, very barren and shallow ; except on the banks of the rivers Naver, and Borgie, where it is deep, and tolerably fertile. The hill of Clib-rigg is very lofty, and its Southern side is partly covered with heath, and verdure ; but, on the Northern side, it is rocky. The extent of Sea-coast, along the North Sea, is 11 computed miles ; the shore is bold and rocky, and consists of Strathy Head and Bay, Armidale Bay, Far Head and Bay, Sandy Bay, and other smaller Promontories and Bays. The air is for the most part dry, and healthy. The principal Lake is Loch Naver, which is 4 computed miles in length : the river Naver issues from it, in which great quantities of salmon are taken, as Avell as in the river Borgie. This Parish is well adapted for rearing cattle ; and, on the meadow of Mudale, which is tAvo English miles in length, and half a mile in breadth, vast numbers of black cattle, horses, sheep, and goats, are pastured during the season. But, as very little ofthe Parish is cultivated, compared with what is lying waste, it is not surprising, that it does not supply its inhabitants with provisions. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together Avith a School-house, and a few perquisites. The Salary ofthe Society School, which is established in Armidale, is \u00a310., together with a dwelling-house and school house, a kail yard, with an acre of ground, and provender for one or two milch"], [585, "FAR cows, gratis, from the Proprietor ; he has also his peats cut, dried, and brought home free. The Roads, and Bridges, are very bad. There are the ruins of six Picts' Houses; and also ofa fort, on the Promontory of Far Head. In the neigh bourhood, are several tumuli, erected over those who fell in the battle between Reginald, King of The Isles, and Harold, Earl of Orkney and Caithness; and at the West end ofthe Church, is a curious sculptured stone, under which a Dane of distinction is said to be interred. The Gaelic is the only language spoken here. There was formerly a Chapel at a town, called Skail, upon the river Naver; another in the Southern extremity, at Mudale ; and a third at Sar thie, the most beautiful and fertile part ofthe Parish. Between Far and Kirk tomie, are the remains of an old Tower, Called Borve, Avhich is supposed to have been built by the Norwegians, and which is situate upon a small point that is joined to the Continent by a narroAV neck of land not ten feet wide : this Pro montory is very lofty, consisting of rock, with some gravel upon its summit ; and on both sides is very deep Avater, and a tolerable harbour for boats. Strathy Head is supposed to be the Verubrium Promontorium, of Richard of Ciren cester ; in it is a stately cave ; and, upon its summit, is one of the finest pastures for sheep and goats in the North of Scotland. Strath Naver comprehends the four Parishes of Edderachylis, Durness, Tongue, and Far ; and gives the second title of Baroness to The Countess of Sutherland. FARANEZE, v. NEILSTON.

This Parish is 6 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth. The high grounds, in the Northern parts ofthe Parish, are chiefly appropriated to the pasturage of sheep : under these, the arable grounds lie on two regular slopes, Avith a fine exposure to the South. The soil is a light loam, and very productive. The climate is sharp, and salubrious. Here are several extens_ATe and flourishing plantations. Game is abundant. Peats, and furze, are the principal fuel. The present worthy Minister, The Reverend D. Harris, most obligingly adds, \" The principal streams are, The Noran, and Cruik: and from the slaty channel of the former, its waters are uncommonly clear. Upon the banks of this stream, stand the ruins of the Castle of Vain, formerly occupied by the celebrated Cardinal Beaton. And, about a mile to the NortliAvard, on a very commanding situation, stands the House of Noran- Side, which Avas built by the present Proprietor, John Mill, Esq. ; and from whence the prospect, along the rich vale of Strathmore, is exceedingly beautiful and ex tensive.

It is 5 m. S. S. E. from Tain. This Parish is about 2 miles in length, and nearly ofthe same breadth, stretching along the Western shore of the Moray Firth. The soil is partly light and sandy, and partly a rich deep loam and clay. The surface is mostly flat, Avith the exception of a few eminences, which are all capable of cultivation ; and about three-fourths are arable. The air is generally dry, and salubrious. Loch Eye, which is up wards of two miles long, and about half a mile broad, contains eels of a large size, and is much frequented by various kinds of aquatic fowls. The coast abounds with fish. Free-stone is in plenty, especially at Cadboll, in the rocky part ofthe coast, which is of an excellent kind. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, and perquisites. The principal disadvantage under which this Parish labours, is the scarcity of fuel. The Gaelic is the prevailing language. The Castle of Lochlin, now in ruins, appears to have been of great antiquity and strength ; and, it is said, that the famous Lawyer, Sir George Mackenzie, King's Advocate in the reign of Charles the Second, was born in it. The Cas tle of Cadboll, of which there are now very few remains, is also of great antiquity. The Abbey was founded by Farquhard or Farquhar, first Earl of Ross, in the reign of Alexander the Second ; several ofthe Earls of Ross are interred in it; and there is an area, appropriated for a burial place for all of the name of Ross ; almost all of whom in the North, bury there.

This Parish was anciently called Inver- Ugie, and often Longley, the Church being situate not far from the old Castle of Inver- Ugie, on those pleasant and extensive downs, called Tlie Links of St. Fergus. In 1616, the Church was removed from that site, when the Church and Parish assumed the name of its Patron Saint, to whom the 17th of November, according* to the Scotch calendar, was sacred. It is bounded on the East by the German Ocean, and on the South by the small river Ugie, which separates it from the Parish of Peterhead : its extent being 4439 aeres of arable land, 439 acres of those rich and sweet plains called The Links, which are not allowed to be ploughed, and 795 acres of moss. The surface exhibits an alternate succession of rising* grounds and vallies ; and the soil is in general a rich clay, which, when properly culti vated, is abundantly fertile. The coast is bold and rocky, and affords abundance of excellent lime-stone, and granite Fish of various kinds are in great plenty: and the salmon-fishing in the Ugie is also productive. Mr. Ferguson, of Pitfour, is the sole Proprietor of the Parish. A considerable quantity of linen yarn is spun here. There is also an extensive Bleach-field at Inver- Ugie ; together with a Beer and Porter Brewery, and a distillery of Whisky, which are carried on with success. The public roads, and bridges, are in good repair. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites, a dwelling, and a rood ofland. This Parish constituted part ofthe great Earldom of Buchan, previous to its forfeiture by the powerful family of Cumyn, in 1308 : when in possession of the ancient family of Cheyne, they built the Castle of Inver- Ugie, now in ruins ; and which aftenvards passed by marriage into the family of Keith, Great Marischal of Scotland ; here Field Marshal Keith was born, in 1696 ; and it continued to be the residence ofthe succeeding proprietors, until the attainder of The Earl Marischal, in 1715. The reason why this Parish belongs to the Shire of Banff is said to be, that the Cheynes, of Inver- Ugie, its ancient Proprietors, who were Heritable Sheriffs of Banff, obtained an Act ofthe Legislature, declaring their own lands to be within their OAvn Jurisdiction : although quite detached, and many miles distant from Banff, it is nevertheless rated to the Land-tax and Window-tax in that County, and affords a qualification to the proprietors, as freeholders in Banff ; but, in all other respects, it is considered as in the Shire of Aberdeen, and subject to the Jurisdiction of its Magistrates."], [590, "F E R FERIXTOSH, v.

In 1633, the District ofKinnaird, which lies betAveen the Parishes of Feme! I and Brechin, was disjoined from that of Fernell, and formed into a separate Parish. But, in the year 1771, at the instance ofthe Heritors ofthe Parishes of Brechin, Fernell, and Kinnaird, the Court of Session re-annexed almost the whole ofthe Parish of Kinnaird to Fernell, and the remainder of it to Brechin : this annexation took place in 1787. Except Little Fit/tie, a small estate of about 100 acres, belonging to William Donald, Esq., who resides upon it, the whole Parish is the property of Sir James Carnegie, Bart., of South Esk, the Representative ofthe Family of The Earls of SourHESK, attainted in 1715: his residence is at Kinnaird Castle, a noble Mansion, lately built in a superb and princely style ; the pleasure grounds are laid out with great taste, and the numerous plantations around it are in the most flourishing condition.

This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and from half a mile to a mile in breadth, stretching along the Southern bank of the river Tay, at its confluence with the German Ocean ; and containing about 2026 Scotch acres. The soil varies from clay to loam, with an intermixture of sand, and is very productive, except the Eastern part, which is barren land, being the North part of that level waste, called Tents-Muirs.

It is 4 miles in length, and 3^ miles in breadth, containing about 800 merk lands, of half an acre each. The soil consists mostly of a rich black loam, and some sand, producing barley, oats, and kitchen vegetables : but the quantity of arable ground is small, in comparison ofthe land used for pasture. The seed time commences on the first of March, and ends by the first of May : but as the crops are so very precarious in this climate, and are frequently blasted by frosts and mildews, the inhabitants direct their attention more to the prosecution of the fisheries, than of agriculture. Fuel is abundant here, and at a very reasonable price.

The Village, which is populous, was lately erected on the estate of Mr. Ferguson, of Pits our ; and has a manufacture of linens, checks, and linsey woolseys. This Parish, although quite detached, and many miles distant from Banff, is nevertheless rated to the Land-Tax and Window-tax in that County, and affords a qualification to the Proprietors, as Free-holders in Banff: but, in all other respects, it is considered as in the Shire of Aberdeen, and sub ject to the Jurisdiction of its Magistrates. It formerly belonged to the Cheynes, of Inver- Ugie, who were Heritable Sheriffs: of Banff, and who obtained an Act ofthe Legislature, declaring their own lands to be Avithin their own Jurisdiction. In 1811, it contained 489 persons.

It is in the Presbytery of Fordoun, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 1794, and, in 1811, was 1570. It is 11 m. N. b. E. from Brechin. This Parish, according to a measurement in 1774, contains 14,359 English acres. The soil, on the West, is light and sharp, Avith a mixture of moss ; on the East, it is ofa deeper mould, and a fertile clayey loam. Very great improvements in agriculture have been made here, especially on the estates of Sir Alexander Ramsay, whose hand some farm-houses, and inclosures, are highly commodious to the Tenants, and ornamental to the Country. On the estates of Wotton and Burn, belonging to the late General Lord Adam Gordon, the greatest and most successful exertions have been made in planting : aiBurn, His Lordship built an elegant House, at a short distance from the river North-Esk, along the side of which he laid out some extensive and beautiful walks. Peats, and turf, are the general fuel. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, and School-fees, together with a dwelling, and School-house, half an acre ofland, and a small garden. The two grea tRoads which pass through this Parish, from the South and West, are in excellent vol. i. 3 Y"], [594, "F E T condition, as are also the small Bridges upon them. There is likewise a romantic Bridge of one arch, called Gannachie Bridge, Avhich was thrown across the river North-Esk, in 1732, at the sole expense of James Black, then tenant of the Farm of Wood, in the Parish of Edzel ; and avIio generously bequeathed 50 merks for upholding the Bridge, and 200 merks for the use of the poor of this Parish. On the estate of Balbigno, the property of The Honourable Walter Ogilvie, of Clova, are the foundations of a very large old Building, which is called Finella's Castle ; and where, it is said, Kenneth the Third was murdered by that Saint.

This Parish is about 10 miles in length, and about 6 miles in breadth, and contains 24,914 English acres ; ofwhich, about 8000 acres are arable, the rest being muiry and mossy, and covered Avith heath and stones, chiefly granite. It is Avatered by the rivers Cowie, and Carron ; near the former of which stands the Mansion-house of Mr. Barclay, of Urie, surrounded with extensive planta tions, and a district almost all inclosed, and in a state of high cultivation, made so by his own beneficent and patriotic exertions : Mr. Barclay has also lately begun to feu a regular Village, adjacent to the Town of Stonehaven ; and by his spirited improvements and example, such great advantages have been pro duced not only in this Parish, but by the County at large, that he has justly merited the praise and esteem of all around him. The Mansion-house of Fet teresso, the residence of the Ancient and Noble family of Marischal, previous to their attainder, now belongs to Mr. Duff, son of the late Admiral Duff, who purchased the estate from The York Building Company in 1782 : Besides these, there are also excellent Mansions on the estates of Muchals, Elsick, and Netherby, where great improvements have likewise been made. The air is dry, and healthy. The sea-coast is bold, and rocky, affording only the Bay of Stonehaven , and the two small harbours of [Muchals, and Sketraw, where fishing boats can lie in"], [595, "F I F safety. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with emolu ments, and an excellent School-house, and dwelling for the Master. There are various remains of Druidical temples ; and upon a hill, called Ree Dykes, or The King's Dykes, are the vestiges of an old camp, which is supposed by some per sons to have been a Roman encampment, and to be the very spot occupied by Agricola's troops before his engagement with Galgacus, the Scotch King : it is an oblong square of 21 acres. On the coast, about a mile and a half North from Stonehaven, are the remains ofa Castle, once the residence ofthe Thanes of Cowie, and which, after Macpendirus, came to the Ancient and Noble Family of Fraser, who were Thanes of the same : on a rising ground near it, are part of the walls ofa Religious edifice, adjoining to which is a burying-ground, Avhere many ofthe Inhabitants ofthe North part of the Parish, on account of its vicinity to them, still bury their dead.

This Shire is situate between the Firth of Forth, and the river Tay ; being bounded on the East by the German Ocean, and on the West by the Counties of Perth and Kinross. It is about 14 miles iu length, and 13 miles in breadth, and contains 257,096 Scotch acres, the established measure ment adopted in this Shire : about four-fifths of the whole extent are arable. The climate of Fife is temperate, the inhabitants are healthy, and thc soil is abundantly fruitful when properly cultivated. The necessaries and conveniences of life are easily procured, and at moderate prices. A considerable quantity of herrings are annually exported from its Sea-ports. The breed of black cattle is holden in great repute by the English drovers. It is divided into four Eccle siastical Districts or Presbyteries, viz., Cupar, St. Andrew's, Kirkaldy, and 3Y2"], [596, "F I N Dunfermlin. Cupar is the Shire ToAvn, and where the Sheriff holds his Courts. The Resident Population of this Shire, in 1801, was 93,743, and, in 1811, Avas 101,272. It sends one Member to Parliament. Here are various Roman remains. FIFES-NESS, in the District of St. Andrew's, and Shire of Fife ; in the Parish of Crail. It is 2 m. N. E. from Crail. There are only two small houses here, Avhich are situate on the Easternmost point of land of the Shire of Fife, that projects into the German Ocean, betAveen the Firths of Forth and Tay. And there is noAv a Buoy on the dangerous reef of rocks, lying one mile North- East from this Promontory, Avhich is of great service to coasting vessels, as the rocks are covered at half flood.

This District is 15 miles distant from Dull, to which Parish it belongs ; and to this place the Minister travels three or four times a year across lofty Mountains, for the performance of his clerical duties. It is situate along the Northern bank of the river Tummel; and is said to take its name from the great number of old Castles, with which it abounds. Fincastle gives the title of Viscount to The Earl of Dunmore. FINDHAVEN, HILL, v. OATH-LAW. FINDHORN, in the Shire of Elgin ; and in the Parish of Kinloss. It is 3| m. N. from Forres. This is a Burgh of Barony. It is situate on the East en trance of a Bay to which it gives name, on the Moray Firth, and is the Sea-port ofthe Town of Forres. The Harbour has a bar that is continually changing, and prevents ships of great burden from entering ; so that the trade is carried on in small merchant vessels, or sloops. FINDLATER, CASTLE, v. CULLEN. FINDOCHS, v. MONZIE. FINDOCHTIE, in the Shire of Banff ; and in the Parish of Rathven. It is 3_f m. W. b. N. from Cullen. This became a Fishing Station in 1716, by the Fishermen from Fraser's-burgh who settled in it ; and, it is now, in 1811, in a flourishing state. The Bay of Findochtie, though at present neglected, claims the public attention in an eminent degree ; as it is susceptible of being improved into one of the best and safest Harbours in'Scotland : and it is earnestly hoped, that The Earl of Seafield, its Proprietor, will not longer delay to construct \" a"], [597, "F I N Harbour that would promote his own Interest, prove a benefit to thousands, and transmit his name with honour to Posterity.\" The Fishermen of Findochtie are distinguished for decency and decorum, and for curing their fish, great and small, in a superior manner.

It is in the Presbytery, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 886, and, in 1811, was 892. It is 8f m. N. W. from Aber deen. This Parish contains about 10,000 acres, stretching along the Northern bank of the river Don, which is subject to inundations. The surface is hilly ; but the haughs are rich and fertile : towards the North, the soil consists partly"], [598, "F I R of peat moss, and partly of muir, interspersed with patches of arable land, some of Avhich is a strong clay soil. The roads, and bridges, are in pretty good repair. The knitting of stockings is carried on to a great extent here. FINTRY, v. MAINS, and MONIFIETH. FINTRY, i. e.

Sterling, including Communion elements, and \u00a380.. 0.. 6. by Parliamentary augmentation : the manse was built in 1732 : the glebe con- tains 9 acres : Patron, The Duke of Montrose : The Church is very old. It is in the Presbytery of Dumbarton, and Synod of GlasgoAv and Ayr. The Resi- dent Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 958, and, in 1811, was 1003. It is 12 m. S. W. from Stirling. This Parisii is situate in the midst of that range of hills, which reaches from Stirling to Dumbarton, and behind that particular District of them, usually denominated The Campsie Fells: And it derives its appellation of The Fair Land, from its grassy hills, its fertile and well watered vallies, contrasted Avith the bleak and precipitous rudeness ofthe adjacent moors and mountains. It is about 5 miles in length, and 4 miles in breadth ; but the only parts, that are inhabited, are a small valley on the banks ofthe Enrick, and another on the banks of the Carron ; both of which rivers have their source in this Parish. The general appearance of the country is hilly; but the hills are small, and are covered with refreshing verdure : the arable soil is light, quick, and fertile. A handsome Village has lately been erected, on a rising ground along the side ofthe Enrick, for the accommodation ofthe persons who are em- ployed in a Cotton Mill, Avhich has been established on the estate of Culcruich. Peat is the fuel principally used here. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. The Loup of Fintry, a cataract 91 feet high, over which the Enrick pours its whole stream, is particularly admired ; and, especially after a Thunder storm or a Water-spout, which frequently happen here. The whole property ofthe Parish is vested in The Duke of Montrose, and Peter Spiers, Esq., of Culcruich, who is the only residing Heritor, and who justly deserves the greatest praise for his indefatigable exertions, in promoting every measure that can con tribute to the prosperity of the Parish, FINZEAN, v. BIRSE.\" FIRTH, in the Island of Pomona, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shetland : formerly a Vicarage, united to the ancient Vicarage of Stenness ; the Stipend of Avhich, in 1811, was \u00a360..5..3., exclusive ofthe glebes : Patron, Lord Dundas"], [599, "F I R It is in the Presbytery of Cairston, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Popu- lation of the Parish of Firth, in 1801, was 632, and, in 1811, was 496. The extreme length of the United Parishes is about 9 miles, the breadth is various. The shores are low and flat, which facilitates the labour, and lessens the expense of making kelp, of which about 80 tons are manufactured here annually. On approaching the Parish of Stenness from the East, the first object that strikes the attention, is a plain between two hills, covered with a number of Tumuli, at only a small distance from each another. Though this has evidently been a field of battle, as the style of these monuments refers to a remote period, it cannot, as has been thought, contain the graves of The Earl of Caithness and his troops, who fell at the battle of Big sic ell or Summerdale, in the Sixteenth Century, Here the Loch of Stenness opens to the view in all its beauty : rising at the head of the Bay of Cairston, from the Bridge of Waith, through which the tide in some measure alternately fills and empties it, the direction of it is North-West to the extent of five miles ; and dividing near the middle into two, by the names of the Lochs of Stenness and Harra, it forms on the whole a pleasant sheet of water: trout in vast numbers, and of an excellent quality, are caught here, as are also flounders and some other kinds of fish ; and in the part of it farthest North, knoAvn by the name of Harra, in which there are many small Holms, several species of wild fowls, such as Swans, Ducks, Lapwings, Gulls, Terns, and Mergansers, build in great numbers. The celebrated Standing Stones of Stenness, consisting of a circle and semi-circle, with a few placed apparently irregular, stand on the banks of this Loch, where the land stretches out at both sides, and nearly divides it into two parts at the bridge of Broigar. Along its East side, for a considerable space, are some beautiful fields of natural grass, among rich ones of cultivated land; near which, are Houses in great numbers, well built, and uncommonly neat in their appearance : they are occupied, at least some of them, by men here called Udatters, who are little proprietors of land, that has never been holden by the feudal tenure, nor subjected to either service or pay- ment to any Superior: and if these persons had the industry to avail themselves of plenty of excellent marl in their vicinity, they might soon render their farms and little estates far more productive and valuable. This excellent manure is, however, sometimes sought aster ; and, in digging, in order to procure it, the horns and bones of stags have been found under a layer of peat-moss, sunk to a very considerable depth. \u2014 Marl, ofthe same fructifying nature, is also found in the Parish of Firth, where there is the same inattention to its application. The"], [600, "F L A road from Stenness to Firth is through a narroAV defile of no great length, termi nated by the long Bay of Firth ; around Avhich, on all sides, near the bottom of the adjacent hills, tliere is a considerable extent of flat ground, fertile, tolerably well cultivated, and populous, composing the principal part of that Parish. To the Bay of Firth, Swans resort, as well as to the Loch of Stenness, in Avinter ; and besides many species offish, oysters are taken in it, frequently of a* large size, and at the same time of such an excellent quality, as not only to equal those of the finest pandores ofthe Forth, but even to vie with the much admired ones of Colchester. There are four Trysts holden annually in the Parisii of Firth, for horses and cattle, to the great convenience of this side ofthe Island. Here is a Slate Quarry, and also a Quarry of excellent flags. And on the North, it is bounded by extensive Peat-mosses, Avhich afford abundance of good fuel. FISHER- ROW, within the Jurisdiction ofthe Town of Musselburgh, though locally situate in the Shire of Edinburgh ; and constituting part ofthe Parish of Inver-Esk. The Market is on Tuesday. It is united to Musselburgh by a Bridge over the Esk, and is considered as forming a part ofthe Burgh, and is under the same Magistracy. This Bridge is very ancient, and is thought to be a work ofthe Romans, who certainly had many houses in what is noAv called Fisher- Row, as Avell as their Haven for shipping ; and from hence there was a Roman Causeway, which led to their Camp at Sheriff-Hall, three miles South-West, and onwards to Borthwick. It is mostly inhabited by Fishermen and their Wives, who carry the fish in creels to Edinburgh, and are particularly distinguished for their strength, activity, and laborious exertions. See, Musselburgh, and Inver-Esk. FISH HOLM, one ofthe Shetland Isles ; and constituting part ofthe Parish of Delting.

This Parish is about 3 miles in length, and one mile in breadth, stretching along the Southern bank ofthe Tay. The surface is level, with the exception of one hill, called Norman's Law, from whence the prospect is very extensive ; and upon the summit of which are the remains of an entrenchment. The soil is fertile, and well cultivated. On the Western extremity stands the ancient Castle of Ballinbrieck, now approaching fast to ruin, and Avhich was long the residence ofthe Family of Rothes. Birk-Hill, the commodious and pleasant Mansion of Henry S_ Wedderburn, Esq., is surrounded Avith extensive plantations. FLOAT, BAY, v. STONY KIRK.

The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (including the Island of Faray) Avas 284, and, in 1811, was 315. This Island, Avhich is three miles long, and little more than one mile broad, is situate in that arm ofthe sea that divides Waas from South Ronaldshay, from each of Avhich it is distant about three miles. A Salt-Pan, uoav in ruins, which formerly contributed to the advantage of the place, furnished a name to a large Bay, which nearly divides the Island, and, under the name of The Pan-Hope, formed a Harbour, Avell known to every mariner accustomed to visit these Northern regions. The West side, and that long point called The Rone, as well as the East side, and around The Pan-Hope, is wholly covered with long heath, afford ing excellent shelter to numbers of Moor-fowls. The rest ofthe Island is either clothed Avith grass, or cultivated for corn ; and some ofthe latter is said to be so fertile as to produce nearly double the quantity of grain that is produced by the same extent of land in the other Islands. No remains of that Long House, by some denominated a Church, in Avhich the Clergy were said to be accustomed to assemble annually, can now be discovered, nor of those three Trophies, called Crosses: all remembrance of them is entirely lost, nor does there exist the slightest tradition concerning them. Tlie Calf 'is a small Island, situate to the Northward of Flota, and is appropriated to the pasturage of sheep. Flota is in the Latitude of 58\u00b0 58' 41\" North, and in the Longitude of 2\u00b0 55' 30\" West from GreenAvich. This Island, according to Mr. Jameson, is of little extent, low, but in several places there are cliffs upon the sea-shore which are of considerable height. It is entirely composed of sandstone, and sandstone flag : nor is it re markable, excepting for its former celebrity, being the residence of the Historio grapher appointed by the CroAvn of Nonvay to collect information Avith regard to the North of Scotland. These narrations formed a work, called Codex Ftot ticensis ; to which Torf\u00e6us is indebted for much of his History of the Northern parts of Scotland. FLOWERDALE, v. GAIRLOCH.

It was formerly situate in the neighbourhood of Gordon Castle, but was lately removed about a mile Southward to a rising"], [603, "F O D ground, and built on a neat plan, having a square in the centre, and Streets entering it at right angles. This is a Burgh of Barony, and is governed by a Baron Baillie, who is appointed by The Duke of Gordon, the Superior. It has a Weekly Market : and three annual Fairs, one ofwhich is for black cattle. It is a flourishing Town, with a manufacture of thread, calicoes, and worsted stock- ings, and a valuable salmon fishery in the Spey. Here is a Parochial School, with a Salary of 14 bolls of meal, together with some small perquisites : And there is also a Society School about three miles from hence, Avhich is of the ut- most consequence to a very great number of poor children, who could not possibly attend, or be accommodated in the Parish School. A General Post-Office is established here. It is situate at the confluence of the burn of Fochabers with the river Spey. The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, in their First Report of June 1804, observe, \" in the month of December last (1803), a Memorial respecting a Bridge over the Spey was referred to us by The Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury. In this Memorial it was stated, that His Grace The Duke of Gordon had made considerable progress in building a bridge over the river Spey at Fochabers, on the Military and Post road, and that he had been encouraged to take the burden of this useful work upon himself, and to give up a valuable property in the Ferry, in the expectation that His Majesty's Government would defray one-half of the expense ; he having received assurances to that effect. Though it was out of our power to advance money, except under the Regulations prescribed in the Road and Bridge Act, which contained no reference to any expense incurred before that Act had been passed, yet, under the circumstances of The Duke of Gordon's Memorial, We felt an earnest desire to afford all the assistance in our power to so important and bene ficial an undertaking.\" \u2014 In their third Report of July 1807, The Commissioners observe, \" We have now to state, that a Special Grant was made, for complet ing the Bridge over the Spey at Fochabers, by Parliament in the Session ending July 1805, and that this most useful undertaking has been accordingly com pleted.\" This bridge, which connects the Shires of Banff and Elgin, consists of four arches : The water-way being 340 feet.

The air is pure, and healthy. The old method of constantly cropping, is generally followed by all classes of Farmers here. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, and a rood of land, together with a good School-house. A mortification was made for the subsistence ofthe Poor by George Earl of Cromarty of 12 bolls of bar ley per annum : and the interest of a Legacy of \u00a380.

The most remarkable Hills are Ben Wyvis, and Knocks allaric : the first of which is one ofthe highest hills in Scotland, and lies immediately to the North of the valley : Knockfallaric is situate on the South side of the valley ; its form is co nical ; and the tradition is, that Fingal had one of his Castles upon its summit: this opinion probably originates, from the ruins there, which surround a plain of nearly an acre in extent, and are composed of stones closely cemented by a vitrified substance. About 200 acres of firs have lately been planted here. See, Cromarty. FOGGICLOAN, v. MARNOCH.

It is in the Presbytery of Dunse, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 507, and, in 1811, Avas 450. It is 4 m. S. b. W. from Dunse. This Parish is about 6 miles in length, and between three and four miles in breadth. It is intersected by the river Blackadder, and some of its tributary streams. The soil is of two kinds : the first, a rich deep loam, comprehending the banks ofthe river, and a considerable tract on each side ; the other, is a light moorish loam, on a cold tilly bed, naturally wet, but tolerably productive in dry seasons : the whole is arable, except a few acres of swampy ground ; and a great part of the Parish is inclosed. The Roads are in bad repair. The Schoolmaster's Salary is 300 merks, and perquisites ; the School-house is in good order. All the Teinds in the Parish, are valued, from whence are paid the Stipend, the School Salary, and the Sums necessary for repairing the Church, Manse, Offices, and School-house. The great dis advantage which this Parish sustains, is its distance from coals, the only Fuel used, and which are brought 12 miles from Northumberland : Lime also is very scarce, and dear : and to these circumstances, unfavourable for agriculture, and the comfort of the people, may be added the Thirlage to the mills. There is an ancient Bridge over the river Blackadder, which is of great advantage to the neighbourhood ; it is kept in repair by the County. At a village, called Chesters, are the traces of an ancient encampment, said to be Roman, but now very much defaced. FOLDA, v. GLEN-ISLA. FONDLAND HILL, n. INCH. FOOT DEE, within the Jurisdiction ofthe City of New Aberdeen, and Shire of Aberdeen : in the Parish of St. Nicholas. Here is a handsome Chapel of Ease, under the Patronage of The Town Council.

FORBES, in the District of Alford, and Shire of Aberdeen : formerly a Rec tory, and Prebend, now annexed to the Parish of Tullynessle : The Church is old, and ruinous. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, Avas 206, and, in 1811, was 178. It is 2\\ m. W. N. W. from Alford. This Parish con tains 4075 acres, by measurement, extending about two miles along the banks of the river Don. The soil is light, dry, and early. Peats are in plenty ; and, in the hill of Correen, is a Lime-stone Quarry, ofa very fine quality. The air is pure,"], [606, "FOR and healthful. Driminner Castle is the ancient Seat of the Noble Family of Forbes, Lord Forbes, Senior Baron of Scotland, who have been Proprietors of the whole Parish for several Centuries.

The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the Villages of Auchinblae, Paldie, and Kincardine) was 2223, and, in 1811, was 2535. It is 4 m. N. from Laurence Kirk. This Parish is about 10 miles in length, and 7 miles in breadth. The South side is flat and plain, making a part of Avhat is called The How of the Mearns, and of that still larger Valley, called Strathmore; here the soil is deep, clayey, and in general fertile : The North side is hilly, being bounded by the Grampian Mountains, and the soil is light and shallow. In the plain, the air is moist ; but, towards the elevated district, it is dry and wholesome. A spirit of improvement is spreading among the Tenants, owing to good examples, and the very laudable encouragement given to them by the respectable gentle men in the neighbourhood. The Post-roads, and Bridges, are in tolerable re pair ; but the Cross-roads are much neglected. Both coals, and peat, are used as fuel here. This Parish is remarkable for having been the residence, and probably the burial-place of St. Pattadius, who was sent by Pope Celestine into Scotland some time in the Fifth century, to oppose the Pelagian heresy. It is also noted for having been the Birth-place of John de Fordoun, author ofthe Scoti-Chronicon, one of the most ancient and curious Histories of Scotland, which have been published. It also gave birth to the late celebrated James Burnet, Lord Monboddo, well known in the Literary world for his writings on Metaphysics, and the origin and progress of Language. Here are the remains of a Roman camp. FORDYCE, in the Shire of Banff : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 21\u00a7 bolls of meal ; together with a glebe, which has been"], [607, "FOR inclosed by The Rev.

It is in the Presbytery of Fordyce, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Popu- lation ofthis Parish, in 1801, (including the Villages of Portsoy, Sandend, and NeAvmills of Boyne) was 2747, and, in 1811, was 2767. It is 3 m. S. W. from Portsoy. It Avas erected into a Burgh of Barony in 1499, at the request of Elphinstone, Bishop of Aberdeen ; the Superiority of Avhich is now vested in The Earl of Seafield. It has the privilege of a weekly Market : and also an annual Market, called Halloiv Fair, which lasts for eight days. This Parish stretches along the Moray Firth for about five miles, and is about the same space in breadth ; the general appearance is flat, with frequent inequalities or rising grounds ; none of Avhich deserve the name of hills, except the Knock-Hill, Avhich separates this Parish from part of Grange and Ordequhill ; and two contiguous eminences, called the Hills of Fordyce, and Dum. The coast is very bold, and rocky, with the exception ofthe Bays of Portsoy, and Sandend. It is abundantly supplied with fish of all kinds. Great quantities of Sea-weed are thrown up here, which is much used as a manure. There are also inexhaustible Quarries of excellent limestone ; and near Sandend, great hopes have been entertained of finding coal. The air is rather dry than moist, and in general healthy. Here is a white Peat, called Greasy Clods, which may be termed a bitumen, and some years ago was universally used for giving light to the Spinners in Winter ; and is still used by the poorest people for that purpose. The Scottish is the only lan- guage spoken here. The Salary of the Parochial School, including 13 Bursars, and a few perquisites, is about \u00a326., besides some small School-fees, and a rood ofland. The fuel generally used in the Parish is Peat, or Turf: but con- siderable quantities of English and Scotch Coals are imported at Portsoy, and even bought by the Tenants in the lower parts ofthe Parish, at a distance from the Mosses : some of the poorer Villagers pull heath, and cut furze. The Bridges are few, and not all in repair ; they are mostly constructed, and maintained by County Assessments. The great Road, between Banff and Cullen, is in excel lent order ; but the other roads are much neglected. On the summit of the Hill of Dum, is a triple fosse and rampart, which appear to have surrounded it. An cient flint arrow-heads, called Elf arrow-heads, are occasionally discovered here. There are the remains of some Druidical Temples ; and also of some Barrows or Tumuli.

The Fairs are holden on the last Wednesday in February, the 26th of June, the 1st Tuesday in July, the 1st Tuesday in August, the last Wednesday in September, and the 1st Wednesday in November. A Gene ral Post-Office is established here. T'his is the Shire Town, and where the She riff holds his courts, being pretty centrally situate for the administration of justice. It is a Royal Borough of great antiquity, but the original Charters of erection are lost. There is, however, a Royal Avrit of novodamus extant, Avith Parliamentary ratification, dated 1669, which certifies and confirms all the ancient charters, rights, and privileges of the Burgh. It is governed by a Provost, 2 Baillies, 12 Common Counsellors, 4 Deacons of Crafts, and 15 Burgesses. Forfar is one of the Contributary Royal Boroughs with Perth, in sending one Member to Parlia ment. The Revenue of the Burgh is very considerable. The principal manu factures are those of osnaburghs, coarse linens, and shoes. Fuel is expensive. The Castle is completely demolished. It is not certain, whether Forfar and Restenet Avere formerly tAvo different Parishes, and afterwards united ; but the Burgh, and Landward Parts ofthe Parish have long had, and continue to have, distinct interests inasmuch as relates to the supplying ofthe Poor, and they make separate collections for them at the Church door. This Parish is irregular, vary ing from 4 to 6 miles in length, and from 3 to 5 miles in breadth. The general appearance is level, with the exception ofthe Hill of Balnashinar, which lies to the South ofthe Town, and is partly within the Royalty. The soil is various ; but has lately been much enriched by the marl, obtained from the Lakes. The Public roads are in good repair. Loch Restenet, the property of George Dempster, Esq., of Dunnichen, has been lately drained ; and upon its banks are the remains ofa Priory and Church, said to have been dependant on the Monas tery of Jedburgh, and where their valuable papers and effects were deposited, as a place of safety from the depredations of the English borderers. Forfar gave the title cf Earl to the family of Douglas, hoav extinct. But the Noble family Aston is Lord Aston, of Forfar; Walter, the first Lord, having been sa"], [609, "FOR created, \" for his good services,\" by James the First of England. Ofthis ancient family, which is of English extraction, was Ralph de Aston, in the County of Stafford ; to whose son, Robert, in the reign of Henry the Third, in 1260, Roger de Moland, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, gave the keeping- of the game in Cankwood, and a seat in the manor of Haywood, both in that County.

This Parish is about 4 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth, stretching along the Southern bank of the Tay. The soil is for the most part a light loam, very fertile, and well cultivated. The climate is healthy, There are two small Harbours at Woodhaven, and Newport, from whence tliere are regular Ferry-boats to Dundee. The roads are in good repair. Fuel is scarce, and ex pensiA*e. There are several small villages, the inhabitants ofwhich are generally employed in the manufacture of coarse linens. St. Fort is the elegant Mansion of Mr. Stewart, who is the principal Proprietor. \u25a0\u00bb FORGAN-DENNY, partly in the Shire of Perth, and partly in the Shire of Kinross: formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, including the manse, and glebe, was about \u00a3160.

This Parish contains about 8000 Scotch acres, situate in the Vale of Strath Earn, and consisting of the Upper and Lower Districts. In the Upper District, there are frequent rocks, but most of the hills are covered with grass, and some parts of them with heath, furze, and broom : the soil is a vol i. 4 A"], [610, "FOR mixture of reddish clay, black earth, and satid, and produces oats in great abund ance. The LoAvcr District, which extends from the Earn to the foot ofthe Ochil Hills, is a fine level country, similar in soil to the most fertile land in The Carse of Gowry. It is watered by the beautiful river Earn, Avhich is navigable for vessels of 30 and 40 tons burthen, as far as the bridge that is built across it, about two miles East from the village of Forgan : the Earn falls into the Tay, a little below the old Castle of Elcho. The May, another small river, pours its tributary stream into the Earn, nearly opposite to the Parks of Duplin: in the Autumn and Winter, the meadows, on the banks both ofthe Earn and May, are frequently overfloAved ; Avhen rich particles of earth are deposited, that contribute greatly to the benefit of the future crops. The air upon the whole is dry, and very salubrious. The Parisii produces very little peat; but coals are brought from Fife-Shire at a cheap rate. The whole emoluments ofthe School, together with a neat School-house and dwelling, amount to from \u00a327. to \u00a330. Sterling. The Roads, and Bridges, are exceedingly good. The greater part ofthe Par ish is inclosed. There are vestiges of several encampments, particularly on the summit ofa very high hill, at a place called Castle Law ; the circumference of its area being about 500 yards, and it is regularly fortified. Avith a ditch and rampart. The Fairs are holden on the last Thursdays, O. S., in May, and October. FORGAN, LONG, v. LONG-FORGAN. FORGLEN, anciently ST.

For some time, tlie two Parishes were united, and supplied by one Pastor ; but, before the middle of the Seventeenth Century, Forglen became a separate Parish, and an annexation was made to it from the Parish of Marnoch, comprehending the greater part of the estate of Carnousie, quoad sacra et civilia. It is 3| miles in length, and 2| miles in breadth : the surface is beautifully varied, Avith gently rising* grounds, having a gradual slope towards the South Avhere the river Doveron forms the boundary : the soil is light, and fertile, and the greater part is under cultivation. There are mortifications in favour of the Minister, Schoolmaster, and the Poor. The air is pure, and hGalthy. Here are two Springs of Mineral water, one of them in the Avood of Carnousie, and the other on the North side ofthe moss of Whitefield, called The Red-gill Well, the efficacy of bo thos which is generally knoAvn, and in use. Peat fuel is very expensive, by reason of the great time and labour employed in casting, winning* and especially in carrying them home : but the tax upon Coals being abolished, they are beginning to be introduced here. Forglen, the Seat of Sir George Abercrombie, stands on the banks ofthe river Doveron, in a most beautiful and romantic situation, and is surrounded with extensive Plantations. Carnousie, the elegant Mansion of the late General Duff, is situate upon a rising ground, about a mile and a half West from the Church, and possesses also considerable plantations, and a good deal of natural Wood by the side of the river : this Estate was a late purchase from General Hay.

FORMARTEN, a District, in the Shire of Aberdeen : This Division of the County extends along the coast from the river Don to the Ythan, and is bounded on the West by a ridge of Ioav hills near Old Meldrum, Avhich separate it from the Garioch. In this District there are no hills, but many rising knolls. On the Southern part of it, near to the river Don, it is stony and barren, and is much intersected with mossy bogs : b\"ut, on approaching the Ythan, it becomes more uniform, and consists of an excellent clayey soil every where capable ofa high state of improvement. Formarten gives the title of Viscount to The Earl of Aberdeen. FORNETH, v. CLUNIE. FORRES, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Shire of Elgin : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend ofwhich, in 1811, was 98 bolls of bear, 20 bolls of oat-meal, \u00a3410.

S., in December, if Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, or Wednesday after. It is a neat, well-built ToAvn, plea santly situate betAveen two hills,near the Loch of Findhorn: the mouth of Avhich, at the distance of three miles to the NorthAvard, is its Sea-port, with the village of Findhorn dependant on the Town. It is uncertain when Forres Avas erected into a Royal Borough ; but ancient Records speak of it as a Town of considerable note, so early as the Thirteenth Century : it is govered by a Provost, two Baillies, and"], [613, "FOR a Dean of Guild,* who are annually elected. It is one of the Royal Boroughs, which, in conjunction with Fortrose, send one Member to Parliament. Tins Parish is about four miles in length, and about tAvo miles and a half in breadth: the South and Southeast parts are hilly, and are covered with short heath and furze : the remainder is one continued rich arable, and well cultivated plain. The air is dry, serene, and healthy. Here is a Grammar School, with a Salary of \u00a320. ; and, from the abilities and attention ofthe present Master, has justly acquired a distinguished character : \u2014 There is also an English School, with a Salary of \u00a315. per annum: \u2014 And a Boarding-School for young Ladies has been established, with a Salary of \u00a316. per annum, and Avhere every branch of female education is taught with elegance and propriety. The river Findhorn abounds with salmon, and occasionally inundates the lower part ofthe Parish. Upon the estates of Robert Urquhart, Esq., of Brands-yards, and of Alexander Pen rose Cumming, Esq., of Cothatt, are extensive plantations of Hrs, in a very flour ishing condition. The Castle is demolished. Near Forres, on the road side, is a large column, inscribed with various figures, which is commonly called King Sueno's Stone ; and which, according to Mr. Gordon, was erected by ihe Scots, m memory ofthe final retreat ofthe Danes. Forres is supposed to be the Roman Station Varis ; and here several Roman coins have been discovered. On the adjacent height, called Clunie Hill, are the vestiges of a British Camp : the area, within the ramparts, being nearly 7 Scottish acres. This is classick ground, being the Town to which Macbeth was travelling, when he met the Weird Sisters in his way : \" How far is't called to Forres ? What are these, So wither'd, and so wild in their attire ? That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth, And yet are on't?\" \u2014 FORSE, CASTLE, v. LATHERON.

A General Post-Office is established here. It is situate at the Western extremity of Loch Ness, on a Peninsula formed by the rivers Tars and Oich; over the last of which, is a bridge of three arches ; and is surrounded by Mountains of a prodigious height. It is a regular Fortification, Avith Barracks sufficient for 400 troops ; and is gar-"], [614, "FOR risoned by a Company of Invalids. It Avas taken by The Rebels, in 1746 ; avIio deserted it, after demolishing Avhatever they Avere able. Its situation seems Avell chosen for pleasure, if not for strength ; and, as it stands at the head ofthe Lake, is supplied from Inverness with great convenience by a sloop kept for that pur pose. An excellent road from hence, along the North-West side of Loch Ness to Inver-Moriston, a distance of six miles, has been made by The Parliamentary Commissioners. In 1767, several Roman coins Avere discovered here. FORT CHARLOTTE, v. LERWICK FORTER, CASTLE, v. GLEN-ISLA FORTEVIOT, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Rectory, attached at an early period to the Abbey of Cambus-Kenneth, and aftenvards given to the College of St. AndreAv's ; the Stipend of Avhich, in 1811, was \u00a3150. : the manse is in tolerable repair : the glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Patrons, The College of St. Andrew's, and the family of Belsches, of Inver-May .* The Church is ancient. It is in the Presbytery of Perth, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 786, and, in 1811, was 835. It is 6 m. S. W. from Perth. This Parisii is about 8 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth, stretching along the fertile banks ofthe rivers Earn, and May; the latter of which is subject to frequent inundations : it also comprehends some ofthe highest of the Ochil Hills, and the detached district of Hilltown and Mailler, which lies at the distance of three or four miles. The May unites with the Earn, a little to the East. vard ofa stone bridge of 6 arches. The ancient Parish of Muckarsey was, many years ago, annexed to Forteviot : there is a place of Worship at Muckarsey, and the ruins of another at the Kirk toAvn of Mailler, neither of which have been frequented for a long time past ; but the burying-grounds adjoining to them, are still used by the neighbourhood. The Salary of the Parochial School, which is well conducted, is 300 merks Scotch, together with very moderate School-fees. The Halyhill, a small emi nence at the West end of the Parish, was once the site of a Royal residence of the Pictish, and afterwards of some of the Scottish Kings ; here Kenneth the Second died. It seems to have been a favourite residence of King Malcolm Canmore, and many Charters are said to bear date from it. Near to this place, Edward Baliol encamped his army, on the 31st of July 1332, on the Miller's Acre, immediately before the bloody battle of Duplin. On the opposite bank of the Earn, is a stone cross, quite entire, upon the rising ground, called The Standing Stane of Bankhead, being almost due North from the ford by Avhich"], [615, "FOR Baliol's army crossed the river : and, on the South of Forteviot, upon an eminence, is another Cross, called Tlie Cross ofDronochy, which is broken off at the pedestal, but contains many emblematical figures : various antiquities haxe been discovered in different parts ofthe Parish. The ruinous buildings on the Halyhill 'were visited as an object of curiosity, so late as the reign of Charles the First : but nothing now remains of them, and only a part of the eminence upon which they stood, as the water of May is continually undermining and carrying off part of the site. The Mill of Forteviot (the Proprietor's daughter ofwhich was mother to Malcolm Canmore), and the Coble-haugh (where was the ferry over the Earn), as mentioned by Andrew Wyntoun, yet remain. Inver-May, the residence of Colonel Belsches, is situate a short distance from the Church, on the banks ofthe May, in one ofthe most romantic and pleasing spots of Strath-Earn ; around it are extensive plantations, and natural woods ; among which, the Birk or Birch holds a conspicuous place, and perpetuates the remembrance of the Scenery, described in the Avell-knoAvn beautiful Ballad to which it gave rise, \" The Birks of Invermay.\" FORT GEORGE, in the Shire of Inverness ; and in the Parish of Ardersier. It is 164f m. N. b. W. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. This Fort is situate on the Point of Ardersier, near the middle of the Northern boundary of this District. Government once proposed to build it at Inverness, at a place called Tlte Citadel, or Cromwell's Fort: but the Magis- trates of Inverness demanded such a price for the ground, that The Duke of Cumberland was offended, and ordered an inspection ofthe ground, upon which it now stands, to be made by some Engineers, avIio reported that it would answer equally well with that at Inverness. Accordingly Government purchased the ground, and a large Farm in the neighbourhood of it, from Mr. Campbell, of Calder. The works commenced in the year 1747, under the direction of General Skinner. The estimate given in was \u00a3120,000. : but, it is said to have cost upwards of \u00a3160,000. Itis a most regular fortification, and is the only one built in Britain according to a regular plan : it covers ten Scotch acres. It has a Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and other Officers ; and, besides two Compa- nies of Invalids, it is generally garrisoned with either one or two marching Regiments. It has lately been occupied as a State Prison ; several of the leaders of the late Irish Rebellion being there in confinement. From hence is a fine view of the Moray Firth, which expands beyond the Fort, and is bounded by lofty hills ; and this prospect is terminated by the Capital of the Highlands, the"], [616, "FOR picturesque Town of Inverness, from Avhich it is 10 miles distant, with huge Mountains rising on both sides of it. *** We Avere favoured,\" says Dr. Johnson, \" with a Letter to one of the officers at Fort George, which being the most regular fortification in the Island, well deserves the notice of a traveller, who has never travelled before.

GRANGEMOUTH. FORTINGAL, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Vicarage, with the ancient Parish of Kill-Chonan united: the Stipend ofwhich, in 1811, was \u00a3150..0..0., together with an allowance of \u00a38. .6.. 8. for Communion elements : the manse is in tolerable repair : the glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Patrons, The Duke of Athol, and Sir Robert Menzies, Bart., by turns : The Church is in decent condition. It is in the Presbytery of Dunkeld, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 3875, and, in 1811, Avas 3236. It is S\\ m. W. S. W. from Aberfeldy. The Fair is holden on the 6th of December. This Parish extends 37 miles in length, and about 17 miles in breadth ; comprehending the Districts of Fortingal, Glen Lyon, and Rannoch ; besides an Estate of 16 plough-gates, situate South of Tay-bridge, at the distance of 8 miles from the Church. The District of Fortingal is a fertile valley, nearly 5 miles in length, and about half a mile in breadth, watered by the river Lyon; the soil is light, and dry ; it contains 26 little villages, and is finely ornamented with woods and clumps of trees. The climate is cold, but not unhealthy. Schiehallion, one of the loftiest mountains in the Island, is elevated 3550 feet above the level of the sea. The Clerical Charge is uncom monly laborious ; for two Sabbaths, the Minister preaches at Fortingal ; the third, at the distance of 13 miles ; the fourth, at 15, and the fifth, at 24, in different Parts of the Parish. The Gaelic language is commonly spoken here. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School -fees, and perquisites. And the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, have also erected four Charity Schools, Avith a Salary of \u00a310. to each master. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. Fuel is scarce. Before the year 1745, this extensive district was in a very uncivilized state ; it was the receptacle of those daring* Free-booters, Avho laid the Avhole country, from Cupar of Angus to Stirling, under contribution, obliging the inhabitants to pay them Black Mail,"], [617, "FOR to save their property from being plundered. But, Government having sent a regiment to reside among them, and a thief having been hanged at their doors, they soon felt the necessity of reformation, and are now as industrious, and loyal, as any of His Majesty's subjects whatever. There are many ancient Forts dis persed through the several districts ; and also the vestiges of an extensive Roman encampment, of which the area is about 80 acres, and where some Roman Urns were discovered by The late Earl of Breadalbane. See, Glen Lyon, and Rannoch. FORTROSE, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Shire of Ross ; and in the Parish of Rosemarkie. It is 166 m. N. N. W. from Edinburgh. The Fairs are holden on the first Wednesday in April, the third Wednesday in June, and the second Wednesday in November. A General Post-Office is established here. It is pleasantly situate on the Northern shore of the Moray Firth ; and, in conjunction with Inverness, Nairn, and Forres, sends one Member to Parliament. The Academy, which has lately been established under the direction of seA*eral public-spirited Gentlemen in the neighbourhood, is ably conducted by a Rector (Mr. Douglas), who teaches the Greek, Latin, English, and French languages ; a Second Master, who teaches arithmetic, book keeping, geography, and all the branches of Mathematics, and a Third Master, who is employed in initiating Children in the first rudiments of literature : their Salaries are paid from a mortification by Mr, Thomas Forbes, Baillie of Fortrose, in 1699, which had been allowed to accumulate to a considerable sum : and the regulations ofthe Institution are most honourably superintended by the Admin istrators and Visitors. Dr. George Mackenzie, the laborious compiler of \" The Lives of the most eminent Writers of the Scotch Nation,\" resided here, in an old Castle belong-in\"* to The Earl of Seaforth, and lies interred in the tomb of that family in the Cathedral. Dr. James Mackenzie, author of \" The Art of pre serving Health,\" is said to have taught the Grammar School for some time in the Burgh. The Fortrose Agricultural Committee give themselves the distinc tion ofthe \" Black Isle Farming Society,\" and meet alternately at Fortrose, and Cromarty. See, Rosemarkie. FORT, ST., v. FORGAN. FORT WILLIAM, in the Shire of Inverness ; and in the Parish of Kill- MaKe. It is 127 m. N. W. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is estab lished here. The Market is well supplied. There is a considerable coasting trade carried on from this Port. At the Parochial School, which is established vol. i. 4 B"], [618, "FOS here, the languages and mathematics are taught with accuracy ; the Salary is \u00a316.. 13.. 4.. but, Avith the School-fees, and perquisites, amounts to about \u00a3100. Sterling annually. It is situate upon the South side of a small Gulf of that arm ofthe Sea, called Lock Eil; where, by the turn of the mountains, it forms itself into an angle, and receives the rivers Lochy, and Nevis. It stands on a plain, almost level Avith the sea: and, on the opposite shore, there is another plain of much larger extent, upon the same level, Avhich Avidens, and exceedingly beautifies the prospect. These plains are surrounded with Mountains, which Avere once covered Avith wood, and are watered Avith many springs and rivulets. A Fort Avas built here, during the usurpation of Cromwell, by the advice and under the direction of General Monk ; and which occupied at that time much more ground than it does at present, having accommodations for 2000 effective troops. It Avas then named \" The Garrison of Inver -Lochy',' from the ancient Castle of that name in the neighbourhood. In the reign of King William, it was re-built on a smaller scale, with stone and lime : when it received the name of that Monarch, Avlrile the village around it took the name of Maryburgh, from his Royal Consort. In 1746, it stood a siege of five weeks against The Rebels, under the gallant conduct of Captain Scott. It is, however, by no means a place of strength ; and, for several years past, has been garrisoned by a Governor, De puty-Governor, Fort-Major, and a company of Invalids. Some years ago, a con siderable part of the Avail Avas undermined, and swept away by the river Nevis, which Aoavs close by it. Since that time, it has been going rapidly to decay, and there seems little probability of its being repaired. Here is a Mason-Lodge, and also a Gaol. The Fairs, Avhich are holden here twice a year, are much fre quented by dealers in sheep, and wool. It is in the Latitude of 56\u00b0 49' 42\" North, and the Longitude of 5\u00b0 6' 30\" West from the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. See, Rannoch, and Lag g an. FORVIE, in the District of Ellon, and Shire of Aberdeen. This is an ancient Parish, situate upon the German Ocean, and is now entirely overwhelmed with sand, except tAvo Farms ; about \u00a3500. per annum being lost to the Errol family, as appears by the oath ofthe Factor, made before ihe Court of Session in 1600, to ascertain the Minister's Salary. It Avas at that time all arable land, but is now covered Avith shifting sands, like the deserts of Arabia, and no vestiges remain of any buildings, except a small fragment of the Church. It is now united to the Parish of Slakis. FOSS, in the Shire of Perth. This District is 8 miles distant from the"], [619, "FOS Parish of Dull, to which it belongs : and has a Chapel, where the Missionary of Rannoch preaches every third Sunday. It is situate on the South side of the river Tummel, near the Western extremity ofthe Lake of that name. FOSSAWAY, in the Shire of Perth: formerly a Vicarage, Avith the Vicarage of Tulliebole annexed, about tlie year 1614: the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 83 bolls 3 pecks and 1 lippie of victual, two-thirds of Avhich are in meal, and one-third in barley, and \u00a356..13..4. in money: the manse, and offices, were built in 1781, and are neat and convenient : the glebe is about 10 Scotch acres, which, with the Church-yard, are situate in the Parisii of Tulliebole : Patron, George Graham, Esq., of Kinross: The Church, which was built about the year 1729, in a situation central to both Parishes, is neither commodious, nor in good repair. It is in the Presbytery of Auchterarder, and Synod of Perth and Stir ling. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 745, and, in 1811, Avas 769. It is 6 m. W. S. W. from Kinross. The Parish of Fossaway con sists of two branches, entirely separated from each other by Tulliebole : the Northern branch extends along the Ochil Hills, from East to West, and is about 6 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth ; the Southern branch runs in a South- West direction, for nearly 8 miles in length, and about two miles and a half in breadth, on the average. The lands being elevated, and exposed to storms and autumnal frosts, the seasons are rendered later, and the crops less productive. Some ofthe hills have moss and heath ; but the greatest part of them are covered with grass to their very summits. Several extensive plantations have been made, and inclosures are becoming general. The climate is often cloudy and rainy, but it is not unhealthy. Free-stone, moss, lime, and coal, are abundant. The corn-mills on the river Dovan have all a thirlage. Game, of all kinds, is plentiful here. The Murrays. of Tullibardine, the progenitors of His Grace The Duke of Athol, were the ancient Chieftains of this Parish, and Proprietors of a great many other lands in the neighbourhood ; and, at this day, the whole ofthe Par ishes of FossaAvay and Tulliebole still hold of The Duke of Athol ; except the Barony of Aldie, the Barony of Tulliebole, the Barony of Coldrain, the Lands of Pitvar, and one Farm belonging to Sir John Stewart, of Grandtully, Avhich lies in the centre of the Barony of Carnbo. The river Dovan in its course forms seA*eral romantic falls, particularly The Devil's Mill, The Rumbling Bridge, and The Caldron Linn. The principal Antiquities are, The Palace-Brae, Car- Leith, Hall-Yard, Monk's-Grave, Gallow-KnoAv, Troopers' Dubb, and The Reformation Clogg. By the Act of Parliament for raising men out of every Shire 4B 2"], [620, "FOU for His Majesty's Navy, the Avhole ofthe Parish of FossaAvay is joined with the County of Kinross. The Roads, and Bridges, are in good repair. See, Blair-in gone, and Crook of Dovan. FOTHERING HAM, v. INVER ARITY. FOUL A, ISLE, one ofthe Shetland Isles ; and constituting part ofthe Union ef Walls. The Minister of Walls is accustomed to go only once a year, in the middle of summer, to this Isle, where he stays eight or ten days : during which time, he repeatedly preaches, catechises the inhabitants, and baptises their children. The Resident Population of this Isle, in 1801, Avas 150, and, in 1811, was 160. It is about three miles long, and half a mile broad, situate in the Atlantic Ocean, about 24 miles from the Mainland ; holding the same situation with regard to Shetland, which St. Kilda does to the Hebrides. It contains but little level ground, being chiefly formed of three hills, ofa nearly conical shape ; the highest of these is betAveen 800 and 900 feet in height. Here is only one landing-place, and in bad weather it cannot be approached. The East side, which is much lower than the West, is composed of granite, micaceous shistus, and quartz. The South, West, and North sides are composed of sandstone and sandstone flag. Upon the West side there are most hideous precipices, inhabited by countless sea-foAvls, which the natives run incredible risks in catching. The account which Pontoppidan has given of the foAvlers in Norway, is realized, according to Mr. Jameson, and even exceeded by the Inhabitants ofthis secluded Island. It is not many years since it was a common observation , that few died a natural death, being either drowned or dashed to pieces among these terrible precipices : but they are now more cautious, and comparatively few are destroyed. The only landing place, which is called Ham, lies on tbe East side, and is generally, during summer, occupied by 16 fishing boats, 11 ofwhich belong to Walls. The Inhabitants are remarkable for being active and alert rowers ; and, although there is not sufficient cultivated land for their support, yet, they are so attached to the place, that they are ever unwilling to leave it ; rather choos- ing to submit to any inconveniences than that of emigration. This is the principal breeding-place of the skua-gull or larus cataractes, called the bonxie by the Shetlanders. Here is a Charity School, Avith the very small Salary of \u00a33. Sterl ing per annum. This Isle is supposed to be the Ultima Thule of the ancients, not only from the mere analogy of the name, but also from more undoubted tes timony ; for Tacitus, speaking of the Roman General Agricola, regarding his victories, when in Britain, and the distance to which he penetrated NortliAvard,"], [621, "FOU says, \" invenit domuitque Insulas quas vocant Orcades, despecta que Thule :\" Now Foula, which is high ground, is easily seen in a clear day from the North ern parts ofthe Orkneys The North part of this Isle is in the Latitude of 60\u00b0 9' 0\" North. FOULDEN, in the Shire of Berwick : formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a356..10..0. in money, three chalders and a half of barley and oat-meal, in equal parts, \u00a38..6..8. for Communion elements, a garden, and a glebe : the manse was built about 30 years ago : Patron, James Wilkie, Esq. : The Church was re-built, in 1786. It is in the Presbytery of Chirnside, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 393, and, in 1811, was 368. It is 5 m. N W. b. W. from Berwick upon Tweed. This Parish is bout 2\\ miles in length, and about 2 miles in breadth, and is principally inclosed. The soil varies from a strong clay, to loam and sand ; the Avhole is fertile, and in a high state of cultivation. It is inter- sected by the river Whittadder, on the South, which runs in a den, in many places from 40 to 50 yards deep. The Sea-coast is steep and rocky, affording no creeks or harbours for fishing boats. The air is pure, and healthy. The roads are good. There is an old ruin, called Foulden, which appears to have been a place of strength and security in the Border wars. Here is also a pro- perty, called Nun-Lands, where, it is thought, there was formerly a Religious establishment. There was also a fortified wall, on the East end ofthe village, the remains of which were taken down some years ago ; and which appeared to have been, for a defence to the residence of Lord Ross, who took an active part in the wars between England and Scotland, and who was at that time Proprietor ofthe Estate of Foulden. The excuses of Queen Elizabeth, for the murder of Mary Stewart, being, according to Mr. Chalmers, too terrible for the ear of her son James, were made to his Commissioners, on the 24th of March 1587, in the Church of Foulden. This Village, which was formerly considerable, is now a Burgh of Barony, under the Superiority of Mr. Wilkie, and is privileged to hold two Fairs annually. FOULIS, EASTER, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Collegiate Church, united in 1618 to the Parish of Lundie. The Church is a beautiful piece of ancient architecture : it is 88 feet 10 inches in length, and 27 feet 9 inches in breadth, and is all built of hewn stone ; it is perfectly entire, although it was erected in the year 1142, during the time ofthe Crusades, as appears by an inscription on a large oak beam that supported the Organ loft ; having been built in con sequence of a vow, made by the wife of one ofthe Lords ofthis place, that \" in"], [622, "FOU ease her husband should return in safety from the Holy Wars, she Avould build and endoAV a Church.\" It Avas made Collegiate by Andrew, the first Lord Gray, Avho placed therein a Provost and several Prebendaries, with suitable endowments, in the reign of James the Second. On the top of the East gable of the Church, there is a Cross ; in the Church-yard tliere is another, 8 feet high ; and, about 10 or 12 year6 ago, there Avasa third Cross, 14 or 15 feet high, with steps all round, about a quarter ofa mile North from the Church. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 348, and, in 1811, Avas 411. It is 5\\ m. W. N. W. from Dundee. This Parisii contains 1200 acres of arable land, and 744 of hill, Avord, and pasture. The soil is, in general, rich, well cultivated, and mostly inclosed. The whole Parish is the property of Sir William Murray, Bart., of Aiechtertyre. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with a feAV School-fees, and voluntary subscriptions. The Public Roads are in good repair. Coals are the fuel generally used here.

This Parish is 8 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth : and is Avatered by the river Almond, Avhich here forms several romantic cascades. The soil is in general a red clay or till, which, by cultivation and manure, becomes loamy and fertile ; a very small portion is in closed, the greater part being fitted only for pasture. Peats are abundant. Most of the services are abolished. The great Road, from Perth to Crieff, passes through the Parish. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with School-fees, and perquisites, and a free house and garden. The climate is healthy. A Market is annually holden here, on the 6th of November, for black cattle. Abercairney, a large and commodious building, and surrounded with extensive Plantations, is the Seat of Sir William Murray, Bart., who is regarded as the lineal heir and representative of the ancient Earls of Strathearn.

It is in the Presbytery of Deer, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, was 2215, and, iu 1811, was 2407. It is 163| m. N. N. E. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. The ancient name ofthis Parish was Philorth: but, about the middle ofthe Sixteenth Century, a Town having been erected upon the estate of Sir Alexander Fraser, of Philorth, it was, in compliment to him, as Superior, called Fraser's-Burgh, and from thence the denomination was extended to the"], [624, "FRA vA'hole Parish. It is a neat and regularly built Town, and many of the houses are finished in an elegant manner. It was erected into a Burgh of Regality in 1613, when the public Avorks, which were built by Sir Alexander, were disponed to the Feuars. The Cross is a fine structure, the summit being ornamented with the British arms, and the arms of Fraser, of Philorth: under it is a Gaol. The Government is vested in Lord Saltoun, as Superior, tAvo Baillies, a Dean of Guild, a Treasurer, and a Council. His Lordship has the right and authority of Provost, with power to nominate and appoint annually the new Magistrates, and Council, by the advice and consent ofthe old. By the Charter of erection, the Feuars are constituted Burgesses of the Burgh, and Incorporated Brethren ofthe Guild thereof: they are obliged to uphold the public works ofthe Town ; for which purpose, the Customs of the Markets, and the Harbour dues, were granted to them. It is subject to the Jurisdiction of the Custom-House of Aberdeen, Avhich is an inconvenience that is severely felt by the commercial part ofthe community, it being at the distance of 42 miles. Fuel is scarce, and ex- pensive. The only manufacture here, is that of linen yarn. The emoluments ofthe Parochial School, which is well conducted, are about \u00a330., together with School-fees, and an excellent dAvelling, fit for the accommodation of Boarders. Tn the West end of the Town, is an old quadrangular Tower of three stories, being a small part of a large building Avhich Avas intended for a College, by Sir Alexander Fraser, who, in 1592, obtained a Charter from the Crown, with ample poAvers to erect and endow a College and University : in 1597, the General Assembly recommended Mr. Charles Farme, Minister here, to be Principal ; but it does not appear, that any thing farther was effected. On the point of Kinnaird 's Head, stands another old Tower, overhanging the sea, called Tlie Wine Tower; and near it, is the Castle of Kinnaird s Head, built about the year 1600, upon the top of Avhich Government have erected a Light-House, which has been highly beneficial to the shipping engaged in commerce upon this Coast. The Parish of Fraser's-Burgh contains upwards of 10,000 acres by measurement, being intersected by the Parisii of Rathen. Along the shore, the soil is in general rich and fertile ; but the interior parts are gravelly, inter- mixed with mosses* and muirs ; and, except the Hill of Mormond, which is elevated about 800 feet above the level of the sea, the whole surface is flat and even. Fish of various kinds, and all ofthe best quality, are in great abundance. A considerable quantity of kelp is manufactured here. Lime-stone, iron-stone, and granite, are in plenty. The roads are good. At a short distance from the"], [625, "FRA Town, are the ruins of a Religious edifice, called The College; where some Monks, belonging to the Abbey of Deer, resided ; and near it is a Weil, where the superstitious practice of leaving some trifle, after drinking of its waters, still prevails. Philorth House, the elegant Seat of Lord Saltoun, is surrounded with extensive and flourishing plantations. From the Fourth Report of The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, in 1809, it appears, that \" about Fifty miles Eastward of Burgh-Head, the South coast of the Murray Firth terminates at Kinnaird's Head, close to which, in a small Bay exposed to the North-East, is situated the Town of Frazerburgh, possessing a Harbour dry at Low- water, and Avhich had been formed by small Piers ; being moreover sheltered by projecting rocks. This Harbour having been surveyed by Mr. Rennie in 1808, Avas found to be improveable at an expense which might be deemed moderate, in comparison with its effect, from which it is expected that 17 or 18 feet depth of High-water at ordinary Spring tides will be obtained ; at Neap tides about 13 feet, and room for forty or fifty vessels. Mr. Rennie pro posed two Piers, which together would cost upwards of \u00a320,000. : but the Northern Pier being much more essential than the other, was commenced by Lord Saltoun in 1807, with an expectation of public aid, which had been recommended by the Committee of 1806, to the amount of \u00a33800. It appeared, however, upon explanation, that the estimate for the Northern Pier only could not be rated lower than \u00a310,440., and that it was not Avithout considerable diffi culty that half the sum could be raised at Frazerburgh. We Avere desirous of encouraging the completion of this Avork, which had been commenced on very inadequate Funds, not only as promising considerable shelter to Shipping on a Coast unusually destitute of Harbours, but as the ancient North Pier had already been destroyed in prospect of constructing one more extensive, so that it rested with us to choose between the ruin or the improvement of the Harbour ; the situation of Avhich is such, that the erection ofthe North Pier is expected to in crease the prosperity ofthe Town, and consequently the Shore dues, so much as to provide for a South Pier also, at no great distance of time. Upon these con siderations,We offered to pay a full moiety ofthe increased Estimate, permitting the work already done to be deemed part of the other Moiety ; insisting only, that no re-payment by Tolls or otherwise should take place, all available Funds remaining invariably applicable to the repair and further improvement of the Harbour. Our Proposal has been accepted, and the work is continued under the same management as before, Lord Saltoun having undertaken the Contract vol. i. 4 C"], [626, "FRA at the estimated Sum.\" \u2014 \"In regard to Tolls,\" Lord Saltoun observes in his Letter to The Commissioners, dated the 1st of May 1808, \" there are none levied bv virtue of any Act of Parliament ; the present Harbour has been main tained from the Shore and Anchorage dues, payable by vessels frequenting the Port; these dues have been established by the Magistracy and Council of the Burgh, and regulated from time to time by them, the actual Revenue of the Harbour arising at present from these dues is only \u00a365. per annum, on which The Commissioners will be pleased to observe the \u00a31000., which I have before mentioned (as expected to arise from the Harbour dues), is proposed to be raised: But there is little doubt, if the Plan proposed were executed, that ten times that Sum would, in a few years, be collected from the increase of Trade which might naturally be expected, and from the additional number of Ships Avhich would frequent the Port : besides the dues could be raised, and from such produce the Interests of the money advanced AA'ould be paid. It may not be amiss in this place to observe, that the Harbour Avas originally built at the sole expense ofthe Family, and that Ave have at no time received any assistance from Government for the maintenance or different improvements, which from time to time have been made in it.\" \u2014 In the Fifth Report of The Commissioners, in 1811, they observe, \" The Masonry work of the North Pier of Frazerburgh Harbour has been conducted Avith great skill and judgment by Mr. William Stuart, and noAv draAvs to a conclusion. There is reason to suppose that it would have been actually finished at the time limited by the Contract, that is, in October 1810, had not the Inhabitants of Frazerburgh applied to us in April 1810, for aid towards an extension ofthe Pier, Avhereby it Avas proposed to carry it Fifty feet farther into the sea, before the Return Pier Head Avas commenced. To this We readily assented, being certain that this extension Avould be the most valuable part of the whole improvement; so that the Pier now extends 715 feet from its root, or 440 feet from the obtuse angle which it forms near the old Pier- Head, or LoAv-water mark. The additional Fifty feet were completed last Summer ; and of the Return Pier, 100 feet are since finished : the intended length of it being 180 feet, and the whole being now in great forwardness. The Harbour already affords much protection to Coasting vessels, and bids fair to acquire considerable trade ; so that in January last a further Memorial, requesting aid towards a South Pier, was transmitted for our consideration. Gratified as We were by such an unequivocal proof of the high expectations ofthe Inhabit ants from their improved Harbour, it was impossible for us, from the insufficiency"], [627, "F R I of our Funds, to grant this request ; and indeed, under any circumstances, it would have required much investigation before We should have consented to have made a close Harbonr by means of a South Pier, as proposed : the example of Burgh-Head Harbour shewing the danger of too much confinement, for the sake of obtaining'perfectly smooth water in an artificial Harbour.

This is a small Village, the inhabitants of which are principally employed in the manufacture of coarse linens. It suffered from the depredations of Rob Roy's garrison at Falkland, in 1716. FREUCHNIE, v. RATHVEN. FREW, v. KIPPEN. FRIARS' CARSE, in the Shire of Dumfries ; and in the Parish of Dun- score. It is 8 m. N. W. from Dumfries. Here was a Cell, dependent upon the rich Abbey of Melros ; which, at the Reformation, was granted by the Com- mendator to the Laird of Elliesland, a cadet ofthe Kirkpatricks, of Closeburn ; from whom it passed through the Families of Maxwell, and Barncleugh, and at length to the Riddells, of Glen Riddell, the present possessors. This old building, having become ruinous, was pulled down in 1773, to make way for the present Mansion. Near this House is the Lake, which was the Fish-pond of the Friary : and in the middle of it, is a very curious artificial island, founded upon large piles and planks of oak, where the Monks lodged their valuable effects, when the English made an inroad into Strath Nith. Mr. Grose has preserved a View ofthis Friary. In the beginning of May 1791, a gold ring was discovered here, which is considered by Mr. Riddell as a very great curiosity : its weight is exactly one ounce, and the stone is of a pale blue colour : an en- graving of it is given in the Tenth Volume of Archaeologia, Plate XL : and in the Eleventh Volume of the same Transactions, p. 105., is a description and engravings of two ancient copper vessels, that Avere discovered in a moss about a mile from hence, in the summer of 1790, and which were also very obligingly communicated lo The Society of Antiquaries of London, by their worthy Member, Robert Riddell, Esq. 4C2"], [628, "F Y V FRIGH, v.

FYERS, or FOYERS, Fall of, v. BOLESKINE. FYVIE, in the District of Turrets, and Shire of Aberdeen : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend ofwhich, in 1811, was 1000 merks, and 6 chalders of victual, one of Avhich is bear : the manse was built in 1762 : the glebe is small, and in four different parcels : Patron, The Honourable General Gordon, who is also the principal Heritor : The Church is old, but in good repair. It is in^the Presbytery of Turrets, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 2391, and, in 1811, was 2594. The Fair is holden on Fasten' s Even, O. S., in February. There is a Post-Office at Lesses of Fyvie, not far from the Church. This Parish is supposed to contain about 22,000 acres; ofwhich, 8000 are under cultivation, 1200 are in plantations and natural woods, and the remainder are mosses, heath, and rough pasture. The surface is uneven ; the soil is various, but in general kindly, and productive of pretty good early crops, especially in the neighbourhood of the Church, and Fyvie Castle. The air is pure, and healthy. The Salary of the Parochial School is 12 bolls of meal, together with School-fees, and perquisites. Fyvie Castle, a large and elegant Mansion, is the occasional residence of The Honourable General William Gordon, one of the Grooms of His Majesty's Bed-chamber. Near the Church, on the banks ofthe river Ythan, are the ruins ofa Priory, which is said to have been founded by Fergus Earl of Buchan, in 1179 ; and was afterwards dependent on the Abbey of Aberbrothock."], [629, "G A I G Vj'AASKEIR, ISLE, one of the Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness : it constitutes part ofthe Parish of Harris, and is situate four leagues North-West from Taransay.

It is in the Presbytery of Loch Carron, and Synod of Glenelg. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 1437, and, in 1811, was 2755. Itis 5 m. S. S. W. from PooleAv. This Parish is 32 miles in length, and 18 miles in breadth, stretching along the Atlantic Ocean. It abounds with hills, and mossy grounds : but the vallies are tolerably fertile, in favourable seasons. Upon the coast are numerous safe Harbours, for vessels of all dimensions : and the Lochs abound with cod, and herrings. The Gaelic is the prevailing language. The principal Heritors are Sir Hector Mackenzie, Bart., of Flowerdale, John Mackenzie, of Gruinord, John Mackenzie, of Letter ew, Roderick Mackenzie, of Kairnsary, and Colonel Mackenzie, of Coul ; all of whom have good Seats, and are resident, except the last mentioned Gentleman. In this Parish is Loch"], [630, "GAL Maree, a fresh water Lake, 12 computed miles in length, and in some parts more. than a mile in breadth : It contains 24 small Islands, Avhich are covered Avith Avood; and upon one of them, called Island Maree, is an ancient place of sepul ture, Avhere the Inhabitants on the North side of the Loch still continue to bury their dead : it also contains a Well of salubrious Avater, and the remains of a Druidical temple. GAIRNEY-BRIDGE, in the Shire of Kinross ; and in the Parisii of Cleish. It is 2\\ m. S. b. E. from Kinross. This is a small, but improving Village; and has a little School, Avhich Avas taught for some years by the beautiful poet, Michael Bruce. GAIRSA, ISLE, one ofthe Orkneys ; and constituting part ofthe Parish of Rendal, from AA*lrich it is separated by a Strait, about a mile and a half broad. This Island is about two miles long, and one mile broad ; and the greatest part of it consists ofa conical Hill of considerable altitude. The Avhole of its West side is pretty steep ; but towards the East, it is both more plain and fertile ; aud in that quarter, as Avell as on the South, the lands are tolerably Avell cultiA'ated. It is inhabited by eight Families. Close by the South shore, stand the remains of an old house, that seems formerly to have possessed some degree of elegance and strength ; and Avas the residence of Sir William Craigie, and others of that name and family. Here is an excellent small Harbour, called The Mill-Burn, perfectly secured on all sides by the Island itself, and a small Holm, which covers the entrance to the South, leaving a passage on each side of it to the an choring ground. GALA-SHIELS, in the Shire of Selkirk : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., together with \u00a38.. 6.. 8.

A General Post-Office is established"], [631, "GAL here. This Parish is of an irregular triangular form, being on an average about 5\u00a3 miles in breadth, and is calculated to contain 8000 acres ofland. The Tweed, which is here an inconsiderable ri\\*er, divides it into two parts, and is the boun dary ofthe two Shires of Roxburgh, and Selkirk. The surface is hilly, and may even be called mountainous ; the highest point, Meg-Hill, being elevated about 1480 feet above the level of the sea. The hills are mostly green, and furnish excellent sheep pasture. The soil is various, being partly a deep loam on a till bottom, and partly a shallow loam upon gravel, with which it is much intermixed. The Seed-time, and Harvest, are both late here. Considerable attention is paid to the rearing of Sheep, and the improvement of their wool. Tbe air is dry, and healthy. It has long been noted for ihe Manufacture of coarse woollen cloth, known by the name of Gala- Shiels Gray : and the spirit of industry is so much encouraged, that they have even established a Hall here, for the more commo dious sale of their various manufactures. During the year 1722, Gala-Shiels was represented, \" as a Market-Town, with its weekly Market, on Wednesday; as belonging to Scott, of Gala; and as having a Toll-both, in the middle of the Town, Avith a Clock, and Bell, and Market Cross, and its Church and Burying ground, at the East end ; the Gala water running hard by the Town on the North, and adjoining the Tweed, a mile below.\" From whence it is evident, that Gala- Shiels is a Baronial Burgh, under Scott, of Gala, who has long been the bene ficent Landlord of this prosperous Village. The Fairs are holden on the third Wednesday, N. S., in March, 8th of July, 10th of September, 10th of October, and the third Wednesday in November. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, with a tolerable house, and garden ; \u2014 There is also a School at Lin dean, with a small Salary, said to be a part of the Parish Salary, granted when that village was considerable for the number of its inhabitants. There are only six Heritors in the Parish. Besides the Tweed, the Parish is intersected by the Etterick, and Gala waters, which are well known from the beautiful pastoral songs to* which they give their name; \" The braiv Lads of Gala water,\" being univer sally admired : and Burns admirably sings, \" But Yarrow braes, nor Etterick shaws \" Can match the lads of Gala ivater.\" 'a The greatest disadvantage, which the Parish, and Suburbs labour under, is their distance from lime and coals, none being nearer than 21 miles. The rocks are chiefly schistus, and whin-stone ; and the red ochrey earth, and the chalybeate"], [632, "GAL springs, strongly indicate the presence of iron. \u2014 According to Mr. Chalmers, the Church of Bolside stood in a hamlet of that name, about half a mile below the junction ofthe Etterick, and the Tweed. The other Parish of Lindean derived its name, from the British Lyn, signifying secondarily, a River-pool, Avhich was adopted by the Saxons, and the Anglo-Saxon Dene, a Valley. Bolside seems to have been an ancient Parish, though it does not appear in any of the Chartularies ; having never been granted to any Monkish Order. It Avas in Lindean Church, Avhere the body of William Douglas, the Knight of Lidsdale, lay the first night, after his assassination, in 1353. Lindean, probably, became the Church of the Monks of Dryburgh, Avho enjoyed it, to their proper use, while the Cure was served by a perpetual Vicar : It had ceased to be the Parish Church, before the year 1649, when the Church of Gala-Shiels was reckoned one of the Four Parish Kirks, in the Shire of Selkirk : but many families still continue to bury at Lindean. The Strath ofthe Gala was early called Wae-dale, from some bloody scenes on its contested margin. The course ofthe Catrail from Mossalee, through the Shire of Selkirk, to the passage of Borthwick Water, may be traced for 28 miles. GALATON, in the District of Kirkaldy, and Shire of Fife : in the Parish of Dysart. It is 1 m. N from Dysart. This is a pretty large Village, principally inhabited by persons employed in the manufacture of nails, and linen. A Fair is holden here annually, for white cloth. Here is a private School. GALIVAL, CASTLE, v. BOHARM. GALLABERRY, v. DRYFE'S-DALE. GALL ALA-KNOW, v. OXNAM. GALLOWAY, an extensive District, Avhich, in the early period ofthe Scot tish Monarchy, consisted of that tract of country which now comprehends the Shire of Wigtown and Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, Nith's-Dale, Carrick, and the Western part ofthe Shire of Ayr, together with part ofthe Shire of Lanark. This large tract appears to have been totally independent, both of the Scottish and Pictish Kingdoms, and was governed by its native Reguli or Princes. Bede informs us, that in the year 412 St. Ninian was sent to the South Picts, and to Whitehorn in Galloway ; and he calls Candida Casa, or Whitehom, one of the four Northumbrian Bishopricks. After the annihilation of the Pictish Kingdom, the Monarchs of Scotland assumed a feudal Superiority over the Lords of Gal loway, which was for many ages disputed by the Gallwegian Reguli, and at last temporarily obtained, only as the fate of war decided the contest. After various"], [633, "GAL transmissions, this Lordship at length came into the family of Douglas by inter marriage with an heiress ofthe Comyns. With this powerful Family these Estates remained until the year 1455, when James, the ninth Earl of Douglas and sixth Duke of Terrouenne, forfeited them to the Crown by his rebellion against James the Second : and all its ancient laws and customs being: abolished, the Lordship was then annexed for ever to the Crown by the Scottish Parliament. It was anciently famous for a particular breed of small horses, which are now mixed with the Irish and English breeds, but retain the name of Galloways. The navigation along this extensive coast is so uninterrupted, and the coast itself so indented with Lochs, Bays, and navigable Rivers, that it may be regarded as one ofthe most eligible situations in the Island, in point of natural advantages, for a trading or manufacturing District. The Shire or Province of Galloway gives the title of Earl to the Ancient and Illustrious Family of Stewart, so created on the 19th of September, 1623. GALLOWAY, NEW, a Royal Borough, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright ; and in the Parish of Kells. It is 80 m. SW. b. S. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. The Market is well supplied, especially with oat-meal. The Fairs are holden on the first Wednesday, O. S., in April, and the first Wednesday, O. S., in August. This Town, in conjunction with the Royal Boroughs of Whitehorn, Stranraer, and Wigtown, sends one Member to Parliament. It is situate in a delightful vale, which is denominated Glen-Kens, from the river Ken, that flows through it. The houses are neat and regular, but it possesses no manufactures, A Far- mers' Club has been instituted here, Avhich has been of great importance, in disseminating agricultural knowledge. Kenmure Castle, situate on a very beau- tiful and commanding eminence, at the head of Loch Ken, and half a mile South from the Burg-h, is said to have been one of the seats of the ancient Lords of Gal- loAvay, and particularly the favourite residence of John Baliol, some time King of Scotland. It was for a short time in the hands of the Douglases, and after - Avards, in the year 1297, with the lands of Lochinvar, acquired from John de Maxwell, by Sir Adam de Gordon, Knight, and has ever since continued in his Family ; one of whom, Sir John Gordon, of Lochinvar, was raised by King Charles the First, on the 8th of May, 1633, to the Dignity of the Peerage, by the Titles of Viscount Kenmure, Lord Lochinvar, to him and his heirs male; and as a farther testimony of His Majesty's favour, part of his lands were erected into a Royal Borough, with ample Jurisdiction, to be called The Burgh of vol. i. 4 D"], [634, "GAL Galloway. Robert, the seventh Viscount, from a too grateful sense ofthe fa vours conferred upon his ancestors by the Stuart Family, unhappily engaging in the Rebellion, in 1715, Avas taken prisoner at Preston, tried, condemned, and executed ; and his honours, and most of his estates, were consequently forfeited to the Crown : since Avhich, his descendants have, by faithful services and bra very in the army, amply compensated for the mistaken attachment of their pre decessor. Tradition says, this Castle suffered from the ravages of Avar, and was twice burned down ; once during the reign of the unfortunate Queen Mary, and a second time by Oliver Cromwell, or his order. A great part of it (two views whereof have been presen*ed by Mr. Grose) has since been repaired, and is now fitted up in an elegant style by the present Proprietor, The Honourable John Gordon ; and avIio has greatly augmented and enriched the excellent Library, consistingof several thousand volumes. The Salary ofthe Parochial School, Avhich is established in this Town, is 300 merks Scotch, together with a School-house, and perquisites. Fuel is scarce. The great Roads, from Edinburgh to Port Patrick, and from Glasgow to Kirkcudbright, cross each other here. GALLOWAY HOUSE, v. SORBIE. GALLOWAY, The Mull of, v. KIRK-MAIDEN.

G ALSTON, in the District of Kyle, and Shire of Ayr : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 128 bolls of meal, and \u00a38. in money: the manse was built in 1727 ; the glebe consists of more than the legal ex tent : Patron, The Duchess of Portland : The Church is ancient. It is in the Presbytery of Ayr, and Synod of GlasgoAv and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, Avas 2139, and, in 1811, Avas 3009. It is 4 m. E. S. E. from Killmarnock. Here are two great Fairs, one of them on St. Peter's day in June, and the other in December : the first has fallen off much, but the custom is still retained of kindling fires on all the neighbouring hills, the evening before it is holden. The great Roads, from Edinburgh to Ayr, and from GlasgoAv to Dumfries, pass through the Village. Here is an excellent Parish School. It is principally inhabited by weavers. This Parish is 13 mea sured miles in length, and from 4 to 5 miles in breadth, stretching along the Southern bank of the river Irvine. Towards Strathavon, the soil is light and"], [635, "GAM gravelly ; but, in the lower and more cultivated grounds, it is a rich clay, and, in some places, a fine loam : the greater part is inclosed. The climate is rainy, but not unhealthy. Loch Gait, which abounds with trout and very large eels, is the chief source of the water of Avon .* and, toAvards Mauchline, is Brunt- Wood Loch, which is frequented by immense numbers of aquatic birds. Game is in plenty. There are the remains of several ancient fortifications ; and in the grounds of Water- Haughs, belonging to Mr. Brown, an ancient burial-place, and some sib/er coins, were lately discovered. Coals, and lime-stone, are in great abundance. The cross-roads are bad. In 1787, the extensive Baronies of Cessnock, Hainingross, and others, were purchased by'Miss Scot, of Scot's - Tarvet, now The Duchess of Portland, who is the principal Proprietor : and around the old Castle of Cessnock, and Barr Castle, are extensive Avoods and plantations. Near the Village are several Mills, one of which is named Peattie's Mill, and claims the honour of having given rise to Allan Ramsay's beautiful Song, \" The lass of Peattie's mill, \" So bonny, blyth and gay.\" \u2014 See, Keith- Hall.

E. from Kirkcudbright. GAMRIE, in the Shire of Banff : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3100. Sterling, together Avith a manse: Patron, Mr. Garden: The Church, which is situate near the Sea-coast, is built, after the manner of some very old edifices, with unslacked lime, and with very thick Avails ; and, although it has already stood upwards of 700 years, it may, if the roof be kept in proper repair, last for hundreds of years to come. It is in the Presbytery of Turrets, and Synod of Aberdeen. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (containing the Fishing-Towns of Crovie, GardenstoAvn, and Macduff) was 3052, and, in 1811, Avas 2858. It is 6\u00a7 m. W. from Aberdour. This Parish is between three and four miles in breadth, and extends about 94- miles along the sea-coast, which is very bold, and consists of an almost continued chain of stu pendous rocks, in many places 600 feet perpendicular to the sea. The surface is uneven, and the soil varies from a fertile loam to a barren benty heath, part of 4D2"], [636, "GAN Avhich is now improved : and that Avhich appeared incapable of improvement, has been planted Avith success ; especially at The Tore of Troup, Avhere upwards of 600 acres have been planted Avith trees of various kinds, and are all in a thriving state. On the river Doveron, which separates the Parishes of Banff and Gamrie, is a good salmon fishery, the property of Lord Fife : and on his Lordship's estate of Melrose, is a good slate Quarry. Near the East end ofthe Parish, and not far from the House of Troup, are tAvo large subterraneous pas sages to the sea, and a perpendicular rock of great extent, AA'liich is frequented by thousands of Kittyweaks during the season of incubation. In the Parish are several tumuli. The language spoken here is the Scottish, Avith an accent pecu liar to the North : the Erse is unknown. The fuel used, is partly coals, and partly peats ; but the latter have become very scarce, and coals are more in de mand. The Avhole customs and services, usually called Bonnage, have been very liberally converted by Lord Fife, ata moderate rate. The Earl of Fife, and Mr. Garden, are the only Heritors ; the latter of whom resides at his Seat, called Troup. It has long been a general report, and the prevailing tradition here, that, some time before the year 1004, in which the Church of Gamrie is said to have been built (and there is at this day the date 1004 on the steeple), the Thane of Buchan pursued the Danesto the precipice above the Church, and tliere defeated them with great slaughter : several of their skulls were built into the Church wall, where they remain entire ; and from hence it came to be called by some persons, The Kirk of Skulls. In the Gaelic language, the word Kemri, from which Gamrie is probably derived, signifies Running Step or Running Leap ; and this deriva tion seems a natural one ; because, from the situation of the hill, which is one of the highest on this part of the coast, and very steep on one side, it must have been a running skirmish, and very fatal to the vanquished ; and on this eminence, are the vestiges of several encampments, which now go by the name of Bloody pots, or Bloody pits. By the two Headlands of Gamrie, and Troup Head, which project a considerable way into the sea, a beautiful Bay is formed, where there is good anchoring' ground, and in which vessels ride in safety. GANILLY, GREAT, and LITTLE, two of The Scilly Islands. Great Ganilly contains 20 acres ; but Little Ganilly contains only 6. They are situate to the North-East of St. Mary's, and are appropriated to pasturage. GANNICK, GREAT, and LITTLE, two of The Scilly Islands. Great Gannick contains 18 acres ; but Little Gannick contains only 5.

This is a small Fishing- Village, situate in a little Bay, on the North side of the Tod Head, called Braddan Bay : this Bay is about 100 yards in extent, with a rocky bottom, and gravelly beach, where small ves sels in summer unload lime, and coals. GARAN-HILL, in the District of Kyle, and Shire of Ayr : in the Parish of Muirkirk. This is a neat, and improving Village, situate on the slope ofa rising ground, near the water of Ayr. Here are considerable manufactures of Iron, and Coal Tar, on the plan recommended by The Earl of Dundonald. GARDEN, CASTLE, v. KIPPEN. GARDEN CREEK, v. BUITTLE.

It is the property of Lord Gardenstown. GARGUNNOCK, in the Shire of Stirling : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend ofwhich, in 1811, was \u00a380. Sterling, together with a manse, and good garden, and a glebe of 6 acres: Patron, Colonel Eidingtoun: The Church, which was re-built in 1774, is very neatly fitted up, and in excellent repair. It is in the Presbytery of Stirling, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 954, and, in 1811, was 896. It is 6 m. W. from Stirling. This Parish is 6 miles in length, and 3f miles in breadth, extending along the Southern bank of the river Forth. All the estates consist of muir, dry-field, and carse land ; the muir occupying about 3000 acres of the higher district. Great improvements have been made in agriculture in this Parish, chiefly by General John F. Campbell, whose beautiful Seat of Boquhan is here situate, and whose unAvearied exertions, in executing an extensive plan of improvements for several years, have adorned and enriched his lands in a pre eminent degree. All the Heritors have united in a regular plan of inclosing Avith dykes and hedges ; and many ofthe uncultivated spots are covered Avith thriv ing plantations. Gargunnock House, noAv the Seat of Colonel Eidingtoun, stands on an elevated situation, near where the dry-fields are united to the carse, and commands an extensive prospect : on the East Aving, there is a sort of ToAver, which gives it a dignified aspect : and it is probable, that when The Peel, Avhich was at a little distance, was abandoned, or fell into decay, it became necessary that the Mansion of Gargunnock should be so constructed, as to"], [638, "GAR become a place of safety to its inhabitants. The Barony of Gargunnock formerly belonged to the family of Ardkinglass ; and the late Sir James Campbell, whose memory will long be dear to the Parish, having resided chiefly here, Avas at great expense in making improvements both on the house, and the adjoining fields : but this house has acquired an additional grandeur, from the fine front lately given to it by its worthy Proprietor Colonel Eidingtoun. The House and grounds of Leckie, belonging to the family of Moir, now also experience rapid and useful improvements. When the Romans Avere in this neighbourhood, the Carse Avas an extensive Forest, Which they cut down, to dislodge the Scottish army that took refuge there : and the carse property of Mr. Graham, an Heritor ofthis Parish, still goes by the name of Mickle-wood, which evidently refers to a former period of its history. All the roads in the carse, except that of Boquhan and Mickle-wood, are so extremely bad, that during the rainy seasons they are almost impassible. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with perquisites ; the School-house is situate on a rising ground, at the West end ofthe Village, and has two floors ; the first for the School, the second for the habitation of the master. The great Military Road, from Stirling to Dumbarton, passes through the Village ; which is situate on the side of a hill, part of the Barony of Gargunnock ; and is accommodated with one of the best Inns upon the road. Some peculiar customs, and prejudices, are still retained here : mar riages are usually made in April and November ; the month of May is cau tiously avoided ; a principal tenant's son or daughter has a crowd of attendants at marriage, and the entertainment lasts for two days at the expense of the parties ; the company at large pay for the music : \u2014 from the death of a per son to the interment, the house is thronged by night and day, and the conversa tion is often very unsuitable to the occasion : \u2014 the less informed persons suspect something like witchcraft about poor old women, and are afraid of their evil eye among the cattle : every thing is bought and sold over a bottle ; and the people who go to the Fair, in the full possession of their faculties, do not always trans act their business, or return to their homes, in the same state. It is but justice, hoAvever, to say, that a disposition to virtue, industry, loyalty, and peace, charac terizes the Inhabitants ofthe Parisii of Gargunnock.

It is watered by the rivers Ury, and Don. The air is sufficiently dry, and healthy. There are several extensive and flourishing plantations on the estates of Logie, Pittodry, and Balquhain, and on the lands of Afforsk, belonging to Sir Archibald Grant. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School fees, and perquisites, and a rood of land. The roads are indifferent. Fuel is expensive. Personal Services, and heavy mill multures, are still retained on many farms. Near the old ruinous Castle of Balquhain, is a Druidical temple, and one of the finest echoes in Scotland. About half a mile West from the Church, is a large upright stone, called The Maiden Stone, upon which are several Hieroglyphics, which Mr. Pennant has engraved. In this Parish was fought the bloody battle of Harlaw, in 1411, between Alexander Earl of Mar, who commanded the Royal army, and Donald Lord of The Isles ; and which, from the obstinacy with which it was contended on both sides, proved so fatal to the Nobility and Gentry of that age. The ancient name of this Parish was Logie-Dumo, or Durnoch, i. e. A low ox hollow Place. The Church Avas trans ferred from Logie-Diirno, on the North side ofthe water of Ury, to its present situation, at the East end of the Hill of Bannochie, early in the Seventeenth Century: at which period, the Parsonage of Fetterneer, lying on the North side ofthe river Don, was annexed to the Parish, Avhich was then appointed to be called Chapel of Garioch, in a decree respecting the Stipend obtained about that time. It is the Seat ofthe Presbytery of Garioch. The District of Garioch chiefly consists of one extensive vale, bounded on every side by a range of hills of moderate height, beginning near Old Meldrum, and extending Westward about twenty miles. This vale is in general from eight to ten miles in breadth, though it is frequently intersected by little knolls ; some of which, especially Dun-o-deer, which rises higher than the rest, have a beautiful and picturesque appearance. The vale is in general good arable land, of a sharp loamy soil ; and being sheltered by the surrounding hills, it has a warm and comfortable appearance. Contrary to what generally happens, the harvests are in many places here more early than in the lower lands in Buchan along the sea-coast ; though the corn crops, from the particular circumstances of the vale, are more liable to be frost-bitten before reaping."], [640, "GAR GARLETON, v.

This person Avas Lord Napier, the inventor of Logarithms, a discovery which, by the ease and expedi tion it has introduced into calculation, has wonderfully assisted the Science of Astronomy, as well as practical Geometry and Navigation.\" GARLIES-TOWN, in the District of Machers, and Shire of Wigtown; in the Parisii of Sorbie. It is 4| m. N. N. E. from Whilehorn. This is a consi derable Village, founded by The Earl of Galloway, when Lord Garlies. It is pleasantly situate, in the form of a crescent, along tlie Head of a Bay to which it gives name ; and Avhere vessels lie on a deep, soft clay, in the greatest safety, and Avith excellent anchorag*e. From hence vessels sail to Whitehaven in four hours, to The Isle of Man in three, to LiArerpool in twenty-four, to Dublin in twenty-four, and to Port Greenock in thirty. At Garlies-ToAvn, the tide flows five hours from the South, and ebbs seven : and it is high water here at a quarter of an hour before eleven o'Clock, a. m., at the change and full of the Moon. Garlies gives the title of Viscount to The Earl of Galloway. GARMISTON, in the Island of Pomona, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shetland. It is in the Parisii of Stenness. In this neighbourhood are said to be the graves of those who fell in a skirmish, in 1529, between The Earl of Caithness, and the Men of Orkney and Shetland, under the command of Sir James Sinclair. G ARMOUTH, or GARMACH, in the Shire of Elgin ; and in the Parish of Speymouth. It is 3| m. N. from Fochabers. This is an improving Village, situate at the mouth of the river Spey, on the Moray Firth. It is a Burgh of Barony, and has an annual Fair. The Lands belonging to this Place, and extend ing to about 240 acres, Avith a right on an extensive Common, are holden by a considerable number of Feuars of The Duke of Gordon. The Feus are of differ ent extent. Most of the Feuars reside in Garmouth, possess their OAvn feus, and live comfortably; and several, from success in various pursuits in life, are in opulent circumstances. From the great fall of the river Spey towards the sea,"], [641, "GAR the tide does not flow above half a mile up the river : the ordinary depth of water on the Bar, at neap tides, is from 8 to 9~ feet. But the greatest inconvenience ofthe harbour is, that the stream, by its strength and rapidity, sometimes brings down in a flood such quantities of gravel as shift the channel a little, especially at the entrance ofthe Harbour. The Shore on both sides, all along the Bay of Spey, is soft gravel, for five or six miles, excepting one Rock, which runs out a little into the sea, about 3 miles West from Spey, and is covered al high water; so that a Vessel will be in no great danger, if there be a necessity, in running ashore at high Avater, Avithin this space, keeping clear only of this single rock; and accordingly several vessels have run ashore Avithout much damage. The English Company, who have rented the extensive Forests in Strathspey and Badenoch, have established their great sales here ; and at this Place several vessels of native timber have been built. The Salmon fishery is also attended with much success. Here is a mortification of 2000 merks for a School, by Peter Gordon, watch-Avaker in Edinburgh. It is in the Latitude of 57\u00b0 40' 45\" North, and the Longitude of 3\u00b0 8' 36\" West from the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. GARNOCK, RIVER, in the Shire of Ayr.

This Parish is about 12 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth, being intersected by the river Bogie. The hills, which lie on the borders of the Parish, are mostly covered with heath, and afford plenty of moss to the neighbouring Parishes, and the Toavii of Huntley: the vallies are very fertile, when properly cultiA*ated, though the harvest is in general rather late. Here is an excellent blue Slate Quarry. The Duke of Gordon is sole Proprietor ofthe Parish. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with a good School-house, and a rood ofland. The only antiquity in the Parish, is an old ruin, called The Place of Gartly. That part of the Parish, though paying Land-Tax to Banff, and affording a qualification to the proprietors as Free holders in Banff, is not, hoAvever, in any other manner connected Avith that County ; being situate in, and surrounded by parts of Aberdeen, and subject to the Jurisdiction of its Magistrates, and in all other respects considered as be longing to it.

It is in the Presbytery of Hadington, and Synod of Lothian and Tweeddale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 749, and, in 1811, was 666. It is 5 m. S. E. from Hadington. The United Parishes are about 9 miles in length, and about 5 miles in breadth : they take in a consider able extent of the Lammer-Muir Hills, the soil of which is thin and gravelly, covered wi*h heath, and abounding with swamps and marshes : the grounds which lie to the North, are of a deep rich clay soil, capable of producing any kind of crop. The air is extremely pure, and healthy. Coals are generally used for fuel here. The Schoolmaster's salary is 300 merks, besides School-fees, and perquisites as Precentor and Session Clerk, together with a house, and small garden. The village of Garvald is pleasantly situate on the small river Hopes; and near it, is a great number of free-stone quarries, of an excellent quality. The Church of Garvald, with its pertinents, and a carueate of Land adjacent, having been granted to the Cistertian Nuns, who were settled near Hadington, they es tablished a Grange near the Church, and formed a village, which thus obtained the name of Nun-Raw. The House of Nun-Raw, is^now the property of The Mar quis of Tweeddale, and though modernized, still exhibits marks of its antiquity. Hopes, the Seat of Charles Hay, Esq., is pleasantly situate near the bottom of a romantic glen, and is surrounded with extensive and flourishing plantations. Adjoining the Lammer-Muir Hills are situate the ruins of White-Castle, in the Eastern boundary of the Parish : during the Border wars, this fortification was of considerable importance, as it guarded a Pass from the Merse, and from Eng land. On the farm of Garvald, is an encampment, of a circular form, and of about 1500 feet in circumference ; and, on the farm or Carfrae, there was until lately an encampment nearly of the same form and dimensions. About two miles to the West, on the farm of Newlands, are two large Tumuli, thrown up in the middle of a plain, and called by the country people, The Black Castles, and Green Castles: The Marquis of Tweeddale, many years ago, planted them with Scotch firs, and some gray wood. To the West of these Tumuli, there are other two encampments ; one on the Farm of Park, and the other on the estate of Hopes. GARVELOCH, ISLAND, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the Shire of Argyle : It constitutes part ofthe Parish of Killbrandon.

The air is moist ; but the inhabitants are very healthy, and industrious. An annual Fair, for horses and cattle, is holden in the month of August, about balsa mile North from the manse, called St. James's Fair ; it is one ofthe largest in the County: and it is a singular cir cumstance, that, although the ground upon Avhich the Market is holden, belongs to The Earl of Kintore, yet the duties arising* from it, have, from time immemo rial, belonged to Mr. Scott, of Commiston, another Heritor.

Game, of various kinds, are in plenty. The air is dry, and healthy. Here are pretty large beds of marl ; and free-stone, and grey slate abound, and are easily quarried. A Roman road runs through the middle of the Parish, along the higher grounds, pointing Westward to Ardoch in the Parisii of Muthil, where are the distinct vestiges of an encampment; and Eastward to the part,"], [645, "GAT where the Romans are said to have crossed the river Tay into Strathmore ; this ancient road, by the very laudable care ofthe Proprietor ofthe Estate, is per fectly entire, being 20 feet broad, and composed of rough stones, closely laid together : and Avithin the policy of Gask, are the vestiges of two Roman camps. GASK, TRINITY, in the Shire of Perth : formerly a Vicarage, consisting of the United Parishes of Kinkel, and Wester Gask, and, according to report, of Chapel-Hill : the Union of the three into one Parish, having given rise, it is said, to the present name of Trinity Gask ; the Stipend consisting, in 1811, of 36 bolls of oat-meal, 24 bolls of bear, and \u00a348.

The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with a free house, and garden. Fuel is expensive. The Bridges are in good repair; but the roads are in general extremely bad. A part of the Roman Road, Avhich runs from Stormont to the celebrated camp at Ardoch, passes along the higher grounds, for more than a mile, in a straight line ; and, with very little repair, still serAes for a Public road. The extraordinary virtue of the Well here, in which it was affirmed in the times of ignorance and bigotry, that whoever was baptized, would never be seized with the plague, has perished with the downfal of Superstition. GATEHOUSE, or GATEHOUSE of FLEET, in the Stewartry of Kirk cudbright ; and in the Parish of Girthon. Itis 101 m. S. b. W. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. This neat and flourishing Village is beautifully situate in a fertile vale, on the Eastern bank of the river Fleet, about 3 miles above its confluence with Wigtown Bay; and is navigable for vessels of 80 tons burden : these vessels trade chiefly to the West of Scotland, and to the North of England, and one of them trades constantly to London. Many branches of commerce thrive here. In 1795, it was erected into a Burgh of Barony, under the Superiority of James Murray, Esq., of Catty, with power to hold a weekly Market, which is well supplied. The best frequented Fairs are, for eight"], [646, "G I G successive Fridays, after the first Friday in winter; and at some of them, there is a great show of black cattle.

The Island of Gigha is about"], [647, "G I L 7 miles in length, and 2\\ miles in breadth, being separated from the District of Cantyre, by a channel 3| miles broad. On the West side, the coast is rocky and bold, except at each end, where the rocks gradually extend about half a mile out to sea : On the East side, there are several Promontories, Avith a few sunken rocks, which render the navigation dangerous to strangers : between these points, are several bays, where small vessels may be moored in safety ; and in one of them, called Airdmeanish, near the Church, is good anchorage in 6 or 7 fathoms water. The general appearance is low and flat, except towards the West side, and in the middle, where the ground rises into mountains of consi derable elevation : the soil is mostly a rich loam, with a mixture, in some places, of sand, moss, pr clay; vegetation is quick; and the air is salubrious. Here are inexhaustible banks of very fine, white sand, which is used in the manufac ture of glass. The coast abounds with various kinds of fish, and especially shell-fish. There is an excellent carriage road, the whole length of the Island : and there is a regular Ferry from hence to the opposite coast of Cantyre. Fuel is scarce, and expensive. This Island, and Barony of Gigha, consisting of 30 merk-lands, holds of The Duke of Argyle, for the yearly payment of 400 merks Scotch of feu-duty : five-sixths of the Island (including the farm of Airdglartiie, which pays a feu-duty to Mr. Macneil, who has an intermediate Superiority over it) belong to Mr. Macneil, of Gigha, and the remaining sixth to Mr. Macneil, of Gallachoillie. The Island is Avell supplied with good springs, which afford water sufficient to turn two corn-mills. There are several caims, Avhich are said to point out the scenes of the exploits of Fingal's heroes, in their contests with the sons of the King of Lochlin : and, in the rocks, are many curious caves. The Well of Tarbat, which was formerly celebrated \" for having the command ofthe wind,\" has now entirely lost its miraculous quality. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with a free-house, garden, and a cow's grass ; and \u00a37. Sterling paid by the Society for propagating Christian Know ledge. Gaelic is the language commonly spoken here. GIGULUM, ISLAND, off the Western Coast of Cantyre, and in the Shire of Argyle.

S. from Gatehouse. This Parish is about 20 miles in length, and from 3 to 5 miles in breadth. ToAvards the North, the surface is bleak, and hilly, and covered Avith heath: but, for ten miles to the South, Avithin a mile of the river Meet, it presents a beautiful level surface, which yields grain and grass of an excellent quality. The climate is rainy, but very healthy. Game, of various kinds, are abundant. Peats are expensive : coals are imported from Cumber land. The principal Lakes are, Loch Fleet {the source ofthe river), Loch Scero, Loch Grunnoch, and Loch Whinnyan, all of which abound with fish. The impolitic practice of thirlage prevails here : The Barony of Castramont is thirled to the mill of Killer en, in the Parish ofAnAvoth; and The Barony of Catty to the mill of ' Burby, in this Parisii : but the Proprietor has considerably abated the multures of the mill on his own estate, which has tended greatly to the"], [649, "G L A improvement of its agriculture. Except the extensive wood of Castramont, there is little natural wood ; though the soil seems very favourable for the growth of trees of every kind. The Avhole Parish is the property of James Murray, Esq., of Broughton, whose princely Mansion, Catty, stands about an English mile below Gatehouse, at a small distance from the margin of the river Fleet, and is surrounded with beautiful gardens and pleasure grounds, on an extensive scale.

It is pleasantly situate upon the river Girvan, at its confluence with the Irish Sea ; and has a commodious harbour, with a depth of water at the entrance of from 9 to 11 feet. Itis a neatly built, healthy Town, chiefly inhabited by weavers. This is a Burgh of Barony ; the Charter of which was originally granted to Thomas Boyd, Esq., of Battochtoul, on whose estate it was built: this charter was afterwards reneAved by King William, in 1696, to Sir Archibald Muir, of Thornton : but, until the year 1785, the privilege of electing Magistrates was never exercised ; when Mr. Hamilton, of Bargeny, the Proprietor and Superior, in consequence of the great increase of the Town, assumed the investitures, and it is now govered by two Baillies, and 10 Counsellors. A General Post- Office is established here. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, and perquisites.

About two-thirds of it, to the Soutlnvard, are hilly, but afford excellent sheep pasture : the low lands are abundantly fertile, and well cultivated. The climate is very healthy. Lime-stone is abundant ; and it is thought, that there is coal in the lower grounds, but no attempts to discover it have yet been made. Con siderable quantities of salmon are annually taken at the mouth ofthe Girvan. GIZZING BRIGGS, v. DORNOCH.

The Moor frequented by Kites, Avhich kind of birds are yet not unfrequent in the neighbourhood, and hence the singular name of the Parish. As the Parishes of Hadington and Tra nent, contributed the largest portions to the formation of the Parisii of Glades- Muir, the Patronage ofthe neAV Church Avas agreed to belong, by turns, to the Earls of Hadington, and Winton; the former being Patron of Hadington, and the latter of Tranent : The Earl of Hadington's right AA'as soon after transferred to The Earl of Hopetoun, whose Grandson now enjoys it : and, The Earl of Win ton's right of Patronage fell to the Crown, in 1715, by forfeiture : The Church is in good repair.

The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (comprising* the three Villages of Glades-Muir, Trabrowne, and Cotts) Avas 1470, and, in 1811, was 1516. Itis 3|- m. W. from Hadington. This Parish contains be tween five and six Thousand acres of land ; above 200 of which are in wood. Between the Firth of Forth on the North, and the banks of the Tyne on the South, the country rises gently to a ridge of heathy, barren moor, on the summit of Avhich the Church is placed; but gradually on each side towards the river and the Firth, it improves in fertility. The rents are wholly paid in money ; the kane and carriages, which were formerly exacted, being now converted. The air is dry, and healthy. The Avhole Parisii abounds with coal, and several Pits are Avorked. There is a Parochial School at the Church, the master of which has a pretty good house and garden, and a Salary of 300 merks, which, with 40s. as Session Clerk, and perquisites on registering births and marriages, toge ther Avith School-fees, make an income of upwards of \u00a330. per annum. There are, besides, tAvo lesser Schools on the North and South extremities ofthe Par ish ; the masters Avhereof are allowed \u00a31..2..2. by the Heritors, and teach about 30 Children each. This Parish gave birth to George Heriot, the Founder of the flue Hospital in Edinburgh, Avhich still bears his name : his ancestors were Proprietors of the small village of Trabrowne, and their names appear some times on the Roll of the Scotch Parliament. This Avas the first preferment of William Robertson, who rose by his various merits to the summit of Scottish Literature, and to the head ofthe Scotican Church : and, it was in the quiet of"], [651, "G L A the Manse cf Glades-Muir, that his \" History of Scotland\" was written.

GLAMMIS, in the Shire of Forfar : formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a358..6..8. in money, 72 bolls of meal, and 72 bolls of bar- ley : tbe manse is in decent repair : the glebe contains rather more than 63 acres : Patron, The Earl of Strathmore : The Church is in good condition. It is in the Presbytery of Forfar, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Popu- lation of this Parish, in 1801, (comprising the Villages of Arnefoul, CottertoAvn ofDrumglye, CottertoAvn of Hayston, Glammis, Mill-town of Glen-Ogilvie, Nether Handeck, and The New Town of Glammis) was 1934, and, in 1811, was 1933. It is 52 m. N. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is estab- lished here. The Fairs are holden on the first Wednesday of May, and on the first Wednesday after the 26th of May, and the first Wednesday after the 22d of No- vember. This Parish is about 12 miles in length, and from one to five miles in breadth : it occupies the middle of the fertile valley of Strathmore, and part of the Sidlaiv Hills, which are in some places rocky, though of inconsiderable height : the soil is, in general, good, and fruitful : and improvements in agricul- ture are carried on Avith ardour and success, especially since the discovery of marl. The scarcity of fuel is the greatest disadvantage, under which this Par- ish labours. The air is moist, but not unhealthy. It is watered by the Dean, the Kerbet, and the Burn of Glammis, all of which abound with fine red trout There are several quarries of excellent free-stone, and gray slate. The prin- cipal Proprietors ofthe Parish are, The Earl of Strathmore, whose Estate con- tains about 7000 acres,, of which, about 1200 are thriving plantations ; and Lord Douglas, whose Estate contains about 3000 acres. The School is very flourish- ing, under the conduct of a Gentleman who is eminent in his profession ; and whose Salary, and perquisites, amount to about \u00a350. Sterling, together with a good house, Avhich affords spacious accommodation for Boarders. A few Ser- vices are still required ofthe Tenants. The principal manufacture is that of yarn, and linen cloth. The venerable Castle of Glammis, the property of the An cient and Noble Family of Boaves, Earl of Strathmore, and their chief Seat in Scotland, is of very ancient date, and was originally a Royal Residence : in 1372, it was granted by Robert the Second to the Comes de Lyon, his special favour ite; who, not long after, received his daughter in marriage : great alterations and additions were made to this Castle by Patrick Earl of Kinghorn, under the direction, it is said, of Inigo Jones : it is pleasantly situate on the banks ofthe 4F2"], [652, "G L A river Dean, commanding an extensive prospect ofthe beautiful vale of Strath more, from which its Noble OAvner takes thg title of Earl ; and from the Palace itself, his second title of Baron. Mr. Grose has preserved tAvo vieAvs of it. In the Court before the Minister's House, is an Obelisk, on which is engraven a Cross and divers figures, that are said to allude to the murder of King Malcolm the Second, and the deaths of the murderers ; Avith whom, in attempting to cross the Lake of Forfar, then slightly frozen over, the ice broke, and they were drowned : This Obelisk is described and engraven in Mr. Pennant's Tour : Divers weapons, with some brass vessels Avhich Avere discovered in draining that Lake, are shown iu the Castle. About a mile from Glammis, near a place called Cossans, is ano ther curious Obelisk, commonly called St. Orland's Stone ; the symbols on Avhich have been thought to represent the officers of Justice in pursuit ofthe murderers of Malcolm. About two miles South-West, on the summit of a hill, are the vestiges of an ancient fortification, Avhich is knoAvn by the name of Denoon Castle: It is thought to have been designed for a place of retreat in times of danger. It is encompassed with a wall, supposed to have been 27 feet high, and 30 broad. There are two entrances, one to the South-East, and another to the North-West. The Avhole circumference is about 340 yards. There are evident traces of build ings, in the intermediate space; and there might have been a fountain on the top, as is generally reported. Macbeth says, \" By Sinel's death I know I am Thane of Glames.\" GLASFORD, in the Middle Ward, and Shire of Lanark : formerly a Rec tory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, Avas 10 chalders of victual, and \u00a350. in money : the mause has been lately rebuilt, and is in good repair, the glebe is pleasantly situate, and consists of nearly 6 acres : Patron, Lady Montgomery : The Church was built in 1633. It is in the Presbytery of Hamilton, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 953, and, in 1811, was 1213. It is 3 m. NE. b. N. from Strath-Avon. This Parish is about 8 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth. The soil is partly a rich clay, and partly a light loam, much encumbered with stones ; but is very productive. Fuel is abundant. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with School-fees, a dwelling-house, and garden. Glasford gave the title of Baron to the family of Abercrombie, now -extinct, GLASGOW, a UNIVERSITY, and CITY, having separate Jurisdiction, locally situate in the Under Ward, and Shire of Lanark : a Cathedral Church,"], [653, "G L A now divided into two separate places of Worship ; it was also originally only one Parish, but has since, for the benefit ofthe Poor, and ease ofthe Ministers, been divided into the folloAving Eight Parishes ; Resident Population.

These Ecclesiastical Charges are all, except the Inner High Church, under the Patronage of The Town-Council ; the Stipend of each of them being, in 1811, \u00a3265., without manse or glebe : The Inner High Church is under the Patronage of the Crown, and it's Minister enjoys a glebe. Besides these Churches, tliere are also three Chapels of Ease, Avhich are under the jurisdiction of the Presbytery of GlasgoAv. It is in the Presbytery of Glasgow, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. This City is situate on the Northern bank of the river Clyde, which is navigable for vessels drawing 7 feet water as far as the New Bridge, or Broomielaw ; but the larger vessels belonging to the Merchants of Glasgow, stop at NeAV Port Glasgow, or Greenock, to deliver their cargoes. This is one of the most ancient Towns in Scotland ; its origin being generally attributed to St. Mungo or St. Kentigern, who is said to have founded a Bishop- rick here in the year 560, which Avas aftenvards erected into an Archiepiscopal See in 1484. The most ancient part of the City stands on a rising ground ; the foundation ofthe Cathedral being 104 feet higher than the bed ofthe river ; and the descent from the high ground reaches to about 100 yards below The College. The rest ofthe City is built chiefly upon a plain, bounded Southward by the Clyde, and Northward by a gentle ridge of hills, lying in a parallel direc tion with that river. These grounds, until lately, consisted of gardens and fields ; but are now covered with buildings, in consequence ofthe increasing wealth and population ofthe City. The Streets are all clean, and well paved ; and several"], [654, "G L A of them intersecting one another at right angles, produce a very agreeable effect. There is a weekly market every Wednesday. The Fairs are holden on tho second Monday in January, the Thursday before Easter, the first Monday after Whitsunday, O. S., the second Monday in July, and on Wednesday after Mar tinmas, O. S. It is 43 m. W. b. S. from Edinburgh. A General Post-Office is established here. About the year 1172, GlasgoAv was erected into a Royal Burgh by William, surnamed The Lion, King of Scotland, in favour of St. Kentigern, and Joceline, Bishop of Glasgow; Avhich Charter was confirmed and extended by subsequent Monarchs. In 1450, King James the Second erected the City aud Barony of Glasgow into a Regality, in favour of Bishop Turnbull ; who, the more effectually to secure the obedience of his vassals, tenants, and other inhabitants of the Barony, appointed poAverful Nobles to be Baillies of the Regality. This Office Avaslong in the family of the Dukes of Lennox, who, in 1621, acquired from the Bishop an absolute grant of the Office. The Duke of Lennox at length resigned it to the Crown; which, aster the Revolution, ap pointed Baillies of the Regality ; and, as this Right Avas not abolished by the Jurisdiction Act in 1748, the Crown is supposed to be still competent to revive that office. In 1611, King James the Sixth granted the City a very ample Charter, by which he erected it into a Royal Burgh, to be holden under His Majesty in free burgage. In 1636, King Charles the First granted a Charter to the City, to be holden of His Majesty, containing very ample powers and privileges, and confirming its power of electing a Baillie on the river Clyde, whose district extends from the Bridge to the Cloch, six miles beloAV Greenock, and in which he exercises a maritime, civil, and criminal Jurisdiction. This Charter was ratified by Parliament, in 1661 ; and, after the Revolution, all for mer Charters Avere confirmed, with additional Privileges, by an Act in 1690. By this last Act, the Council have the power of nominating and choosing their own Magistrates, and other officers of the Burgh, as fully and freely as the City of Edinburgh, or any other Royal Burgh. The government ofthe City is vested in a Provost, four Baillies, a Dean of Guild, Deacon Convener, Treasurer, Master of Works, 13 Merchant and 12 Trades' Counsellors. The Provost and two ofthe Baillies must, by the Set of the Burgh, be elected from the Merchant rank, and the other two Baillies from the Trades rank. The Provost is, from courtesy and custom, styled Lord Provost; he is Lord of the Police of the City, Presi dent ofthe Community, and is, ex officio, a Justice ofthe Peace for both the Bo rough and County. The Baillies have the same Office as Aldermen, and hold a"], [655, "G L A Town Court every Friday, for the decision of all Civil causes : they have also a Court on Monday, for deciding all causes, in a summary manner, under Twenty Shillings: besides these stated weekly Courts, the Magistrates daily decide in causes, which require summary discussion, without Avaiting the ordinary forms of Court: and they also exercise a criminal Jurisdiction, in cases whose punish ment does not infer death or demembration, or farther banishment than beyond The Liberties ofthe Burgh. The Dean of Guild, Avith the assistance of four per sons chosen by the Merchants and four by the Trades, holds a Court every Thursday, for determining in all matters relative to buildings, and differences arising from neighbourhood of property within the City, and also for regulating and over-seeing the Aveights and measures. The Sheriff of Lanark, or his Sub stitute, holds a Court here every Wednesday. The Commissariot Courts of Glasgow, and of Hamilton and Campsie, are holden on Thursday: And the Lords of Justiciary hold the Assizes here in Spring and Autumn, for the Coun ties of Lanark, Renfrew, and Dunbarton. The Police ofthe City is very strict ; and, in 1789, a Bridewell was established for the confinement and punishment of petty offenders. The revenue of the City, in the management of the ToAvn- Council, is very considerable ; arising from a duty upon all grain and meal brought into the City, and which tax is denominated The Ladles; \u2014 from the rents of lands and houses belonging to the Community ; \u2014 from an impost of two-pen nies Scotch, upon every Scotch pint of ale or beer brewed, imported, or sold, within the City ; \u2014 from certain dues payable out ofthe Markets ; \u2014 from the rents of the seats in Churches ; \u2014 and from the dues of cranage at the Quay and Weigh house, and other small customs usual in Royal Boroughs. As to the Tonnage on the river, the Pontage ofthe bridge, and Statute-work; these, making no part ofthe City revenue, are kept separate and distinct under the management of Commissioners, appointed by Act of Parliament. Glasgow is one ofthe Contrir butary Royal Boroughs with Rutherglen, in sending one Member to Parliament. Its foreign commerce, and manufactures, are very extensive ; which- in 1783, had increased so much, that a Society was formed, called ' ' Tlte Chamber of Commerce and Manufactures,\" and a Royal Charter was afterwards obtained, incorporating them into a Body Politic, which is managed by Thirty Directors ; they have since employed their influence and funds, for the benefit and protection of the trade and manufactures, and by their exertions have been, in many instances, of essential service. The Public buildings are numerous, and elegant. There are various extensive Charitable Institutions, which are most honourably conducted ; and"], [656, "G L A besides these, there are several mortifications for Charity Schools. The dif ferent Incorporations have also established funds for the support of their decayed members, widows, and children : And, in like manner, The Faculty of Phy sicians and Surgeons, established by charter in 1559, and The Faculty of Procurators, have each considerable funds for the same benevolent purposes. Independent of these Institutions, there are likeAvise a great number of Friendly Societies, for supporting their members in distress, and which are managed Avith a frugality* and good sense, that are exemplary. Besides a considerable number of PriAate Schools, a very elegant Building has lately been erected for The Public Grammar School, in Avhich the course of education is four years, and is conducted by four Masters, who each carry on their classes the whole time, having equal Salaries of \u00a325. each for the three first years, and \u00a335. for the fourth year : each Scholar pays 5s. per quarter, besides a present at Candlemas : great care is taken in the choice ofthe Masters, both as to their moral character and professional abilities ; and to this great attention, Avhich is invariably bestoAved upon it by the Town-Council, is the present flourishing state ofthe School to be ascribed. Indeed the whole ofthe Public Buildings, The Town-Hall, \u2014 Assem bly Hall, \u2014 Theatre, \u2014 Royal Infirmary, \u2014 Lunatic Asylum, \u2014 New Prison, \u2014 Hospitals, \u2014 and Public Market-Places,\u2014 reflect the greatest credit on the taste and patriotic sentiments ofthe Magistrates of The City of Glasgow. The climate is moist, but very healthy. Coals, and free-stone, are in abundance. In the time of the Civil wars, Glasgow suffered severely ; to the mischief attending intestine discord, were added a pestilence and famine ; and to com plete their misfortunes, a violent fire broke out in June 1652, which destroyed a great part ofthe City. During the time ofthe Rebellion in 1745, the citizens of GlasgoAv gave ample proof of their attachment to The House of Hanover, by raising two battalions for the service of Government : this piece of Loyalty, however, had like to have cost them dear : for the Rebels, in their journey to the South, took a resolution to plunder and burn the city, and which would pro bably have been done, if Mr. Cameron, of Loch-Eil, had not threatened, in that case, to vvithdraAv his Clan : a heavy contribution was, however, imposed ; and on their return from England, they were again obliged to furnish them with various necessaries : In 1749, on an application to Parliament, the City was alloAved \u00a310,000., for the several expenses Avhich they had incurred. There are tAA*o stone Bridges over the Clyde, besides a Avooden Bridge for foot passen gers. The Cathedral, or High Church, dedicated to St. Mungo, or St. Kentigern,"], [657, "G L A is a venerable monument of Gothic architecture, and the most entire in the Kingdom, being one of those few stately fabricks which escaped destruction at the time ofthe Reformation ; it was saved by the public spirit ofthe Citizens, who, taking arms, declared that they would bury under the ruins the first person who attempted the sacrilege ; and for this sensible zeal, we are indebted for so great an ornament to the place. Near the Cathedral, was the Bishop's Palace, or Castle, which having gone to decay, its ruins were taken down, and the ground, whereon it stood, was granted by the Crowu, for the site of The Infirmary. \u2014 The University of Glasgow was founded in 1450, by William Turnbull, Bishop of Glasgow, who endowed it with an ample revenue, and King James the Second granted it many immunities and privileges. In 1560, the Reformation brought the University almost to annihilation ; its members, who were Ecclesiastics, dispersed themselves to avoid the popular fury; and the Chancellor, James Beaton, carried with him all the Charters and official documents to France, and deposited them in the Scotch College at Paris, to be restored on the re-establishment of Popery. In that reduced state the Univer sity continued until the year 1577, when James the Sixth granted it a new Charter of erection, and bestowed upon it some valuable property ; since which period, its reputation has been constantly increasing. The present state of The University is a Chancellor, who is generally a Nobleman of high rank, a Lord Rector, a Dean of Faculty, a Principal, and 16 Professors, who are chosen annually on the 15th of November, by the whole University, Masters, and Stu dents. The Principal, who is always a Clergyman, is Vice-Chancellor, and, in that character, presides at the conferring of degrees. The degree of Master of Arts is conferred upon those, who have studied four years at least, after sub mitting to be examined in Philosophy, Mathematics, Greek, and Latin. The degree of Doctor in Medicine is usually conferred , after the Candidate has devoted three years to medical studies, and publicly defended a Thesis before the Senatus Academicus. The degree of Doctor in Divinity, and Laws, is altogether com plimentary. The degree of Bachelor is not known in the Scotch Universities. Besides the Principal, Avho is Primarius Professor of Theology, there is in that Faculty, a Professor of Theology, of Oriental Languages, and of Church History, who all teach without receiving any honorarium from their Students. There is only one Professor of Laws. In the Medical Faculty, there are two Professors ; besides Lecturers in Chemistry, MateriaMedica,/and Botany. There are three Professors of Philosophy ; viz. of Natural, of Moral, of Logic and Metaphysics. vol. i. 4 G"], [658, "G L A The last now deA'otes a considerable part of the course to Rhetoric and Belles Lettres. There is a Professor of Practical Astronomy, Avho takes charge ofthe Observatory, in Avhich there is a good apparatus. There is likeAvise a Professor of Natural History. The Professors of Greek and Latin are most numerously attended. The College buildings, though not splendid, are neat and commo dious, and have been of late considerably enlarged : the Principal, and most of the Professors, possess convenient houses contiguous to the public buildings, behind Avhich there is a garden of 10 acres, Avhich is appropriated to the use of the Members of the University. The University Library, to Avhich all the advanced Students have access, is a large and valuable collection of books : it has lately been greatly enriched in the Mathematical department, by the library ofthe late celebrated Robert Simpson, M. D., author ofthe valuable translation of Euclid. The important collection of rare books and manuscripts, anatomical preparations, and the inestimable cabinet of medals and coins, bequeathed by the late William Hunter, M.D. , has occasioned the erection of an elegant building for their reception: it stands in the Garden, opposite to the South- East front of The College, which has lately been re-built, and does great credit to the taste ofthe Architect, Mr. Stark. In 1796, An Academical Institution was founded by the late Mr. Anderson, Professor of Natural Philosophy in the University of Glasgow, avIio left to the Trustees, appointed to conduct it, his valuable apparatus, his library, and museum, as Avell as his property of every kind. From these funds, assisted with liberal Subscriptions from other public spirited persons, a handsome and commodious building, containing an elegant Lecture-Room, and other Apartments for the Instruments, and Museum, has been erected. The intention of this Institution is, to afford a regular course of Instruction to those persons Avho do not intend to enter any ofthe Universities, and to admit the Ladies to the same benefits of Knowledge, which other Semi naries do not alloAv ; and accordingly, courses of Popular Lectures are given on the mathematics, chemistry, botany, and natural philosophy : Connected with this Institution, is an elegant Observatory, in which there is one of Dr. Herschel's first rate telescopes, fitted up under the eye of that eminent astro nomer. The Convent of Dominicans, ox Black Friars, xv as founded, in 1270, by the Bishop and Chapter ofthis City. There was also a Convent of Obser vantines, founded in 1476, by John, Bishop of GlasgoAv, and Thomas Forsyth, Rector of Glasgow : in 1559, Jeremy Russel, a Friar ofthis place, and a man of great learning, was burnt as an Heretick : and in the year following, the"], [659, "G L A Convent was demolished by The Duke of Chatelherault and The Earl of Argyle. Tliere was also an Hospital for sick persons, dedicated to St. Nicholas. Glasgow gives the title of Earl to the Ancient and Noble Family of Boyle.

The soil is, in general, a pretty deep loam, tolerably early along the side ofthe river ; but, in those parts, which lie at a distance, the harvest is very precarious : the hills are covered with black cattle, and sheep. The roads are bad. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with a rood ofland.

It is in the Presbytery of Inverary, and Synod of Argyle. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 3293, and, in 1811, was 3400. It is 4 in. N. b. W. from Loch-Gilp-Head. This 4G2"], [660, "G L A Parish is 22 miles in length, and, for the most part, 12 miles in breadth. The surface rises gradually from both sides to the centre, which is occupied by a considerable extent of muir land, covered with heath : on the banks ofthe river Ad, Avhich is subject to sudden inundations, the soil is a deep rich loam ; and on the shores of Loch Fine, which bounds it on the East, it is generally a black loam, lying on lime-stone rock. The climate is rainy. Fuel is expensive. The Fisheries are prosecuted Avith great success. Here is a Parochial School : and, in the Braes ofthis and the neighbouring Parish, is a Catechist, Avith a Salary from the Royal Bounty : and, in the lower District, there is a sewing and knit ting Mistress, with a Salary from the Society for propagating Christian Know ledge, Avho have also another School upon Loch Fine Side.

It is in the Presbytery of Wigtown, and Synod of Galloway. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 860, and, in 1811, was 1047. It is l\u00a3 m. S. W. from Whitehom. This Parish is about 1\\ miles in length, and from \\\\ to 2\\ miles in breadth, stretching along the Eastern side ofthe Bay of Luce: its natural aspect is rugged, unequal, and hilly ; and, towards the North, it is rocky, and, for the most part, covered with heath : the lower tracts are marshy, and the soil is usually loam, gravel, clay, or moss. The sea coast is bold, and abrupt ; and upon a rock within the sea-mark, at a place called Monreith, is a vast abundance of those marine plants which are used as manure, or burnt into kelp. Aquatic birds, of various kinds, are ex ceedingly numerous ; and a great variety of fish are taken upon the coast. In the improvement of agriculture, and of rural \u0153conomy in general, the principal Resident landholders ofthis Parish have paid extraordinary and highly successful attention to this important object. The Roads are in tolerable repair. The House of Physgill, the Seat of Robert Hawthorn Stewart, Esq., is a spacious and elegant Mansion ; \u2014 Castle Stewart, the Seat of Mr. Stewart, affords a fine specimen of the taste of its Proprietor; and the Mansion House of Glasserton,"], [661, "G L E was built and adorned in the most judicious manner by its late amiable owner, the brave Admiral Keith Stewart.

It is in the Presbytery of Fordoun, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (including the village of Drumlithie) was 1204, and, in 1811, was 1227. It is 7 m. N. N. E. from Laurence Kirk. This Parish is situate in a vale, along the banks ofthe river Bervie, and contains 13,965 English acres. The soil, in the upper part ofthe Parish, is generally a Avet blueish clay; and, in the lower part, a light loam, and abundantly fertile. The improvements in agriculture in this Neighbourhood and the County in general, are principally, if not altogether, indebted to Mr. Barclay, of Urie, whose exertions have been indefatigable, and attended with great success. The climate is rather cold, but not unhealthy. The Tenants ofthe late Lord Monboddo hold their Farms on easy, and, perhaps, peculiar terms ; and, from this circumstance, and the coun tenance of His Lordship, they had the greatest encouragement to industry. Their leases are, probably, of an uncommon nature ; being, a life, 19 years, and a life ; the possessor, during the 19 years, names the life with which the lease ends.

This Parish is about 4 miles in length, and from half a mile to a mile in breadth, lying along* the banks ofthe Bucket, a small tributary stream of the river Don. The soil is, for the most part, a light loam ; and, being sur rounded by hills, the harvest is by no means so late as might be expected. The Avhole Parish is the property of The Earl of Fife. There are still the remains of the House, called Badenyon, which gives name to that excellent Song, \" John of Badenyon.\" GLEN-BUILG, v. KIRK MICHAEL.

Sterling, and \u00a38. .6.. 8. for Communion elements : the manse is in decent repair : the glebe consists of more than the legal extent : Patron, The Marquis of Queensberry : The Church is in tolerable condition. It is in the Presbytery of Penpont, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (including the increasing Villages of Dunreggan, and Minniehive) was 1403, and, in 1811, was 1666. It is 2\\ m. E. from Minnielrive. This Parish is 11 computed miles in length, and from 3 to 5 miles in breadth. The soil is in general good, especially on the banks ofthe rivers, but it is there sub- ject to inundations : the hills afford excellent pasture to all kinds of cattle. It is watered by the small rivers, Cairn, Castle Faim, Craigdarroch, and Dal- what. There are tAvo Public Schools ; one of them for Latin, with a Salary of 300 merks ; and the other for English, writing, and arithmetic, with a Salary of \u00a34., by priAate donation. The climate is healthy. On the South-East side of the Parish, is a Loch, called Loch Orr, and from Avhich the river Orr issues : it is about three miles in circumference, and contains pike of great size, and a few very large trouts. Game is abundant. The earthen mounds here, called Ingle- stone Moats, or Bow Butts, are by tradition reported to have been the place, Avhere the ancient Lords of the Barony of Glen Cairn exercised their vassals and folloAvers in the practice of archery. These meetings Avere called Weapon-Shows, i. e., Shows or Musters of Weapons ; similar to what, in the time ofthe Saxons,"], [663, "G L E were in England styled Wapentakes ; Avhence the Divisions of the County of York are denominated. The Scotch Parliament, according to Mr. Grose, were extremely sensible of the great consequence of Archery, and therefore passed several acts at different periods ; the substance ofwhich Avere, that all men be tween the ages of Sixteen and Sixty should acquire that art, and repair to these Butts at stated times, there to practise it, and other warlike exercises, under the inspection ofthe Sheriff or his Deputy, Avho was directed to attend on those oc casions. The Butts are here the most perfect of any in this County; the remains of others are still to be seen near Lochmaben. In the neighbourhood of these Butts, formerly stood the small, but strong, Castle of Jerburgh, ofwhich at pre sent only the fragments of a Avail are remaining. Tradition reports a variety of wonderful stories of its ancient Lord, and his sons ; he Avas named Jonkin Fer guson ; \u2014 Mr. Grose has preserved a vieAV of these Butts. Glencairn gave the title of Earl to the family of Cunningham, noAv dormant, or extinct. GLENCAPLE, in the Shire of Dumfries ; and in the Parish of Caerlave rock. This is an improving Village, situate on the Eastern bank of the river Nith, at the distance of 5 m. S. from Dumfries. Here is a harbour for vessels of from 30 to 90 tons burden, in which the tide rises 12 feet, at the full and change ofthe Moon. Much business in the Coasting* trade is transacted here, and a considerable quantity of timber is annually imported into the Nith from Memel, and Riga : but the vessels employed in these voyages are generally obliged to unload at The Carse, six miles beloAV Glencaple Quay. A short distance from hence, close by the shore, was a Cell or Chapel, dedicated to St. Columba; and near it, is a well, of which no person was formerly permitted to drink Avithout leaving a portion of victuals, or a piece of money, as alms to the inhabitant of the Cell. The Nith abounds with fish of various kinds. GLENCOE, in the District of Lorn, and Shire of Argyle ; and in the Par ish of Appin : a Missionary is established here for this, and the neighbouring Glens belonging to the Parish of Ardchattan. It is 17 m. N. E. from Appin. This beautiful vale is watered by the Coe, a very rapid river, the Cona of Ossian, which falls into Loch Leven. It is also famous for having been the birth-place of Ossian, as appears from many passages in the poems of that Bard, and many of the surrounding mountains are accurately described ; on the South, is the lofty Malmor, and, on the North, is the celebrated Con Fion, or Tlte Hill of 'Fing al. It were to be wished, that the Historian ofthis Glen could record nothing worse of it than the martial deeds of Fingal, and his heroes ; but"], [664, "G L E it is memorable for a deed, the most barbarous that has happened in modern times, or Avas ever sanctioned by any regular government, \u2014 The Massacre, in 1691. \u2014 \" On William's departure for Ireland,\" says Mr. Laing, \" to dispos- sess James of iris last Kingdom, a plan Avas suggested for the security of Scot- land, to persuade the Highlanders to submit to Government, by sums of money distributed among the Claus. The arrival of Buchan, and the expectations entertained from Montgomery's plots, had prevented its success. The Epis- copal Lords who repaired to Court on the King's return, to implore a pardon, endeavoured to extenuate their concern in the plot, by their apprehensions from the Presbyterians, \u2014 promised to support the Established Government, if pro- tected from the fury of Melville's party, \u2014 and engaged to appease the dis- orders of the Highlands, if the remainder of their Clergy were preserved from expulsion. Though nothing could be more insincere than their promises, The Earl of Melville was gently displaced with his friends. Sir John Dalrymple, the Master of Stair, was appointed Secretary ; The Earl of Tweeddale, Chan cellor ; Lothian, Commissioner to the Assembly, which Avas soon dissolved ; and, by a political mistake that disgusted the Presbyterians, some of the late plotters were admitted into Administration, while they continued secretly devoted to James. Breadalbane, whose influence was extensive in the Highlands, was en trusted with \u00a312,000. to reconcile the Chieftains, or rather to purchase a cessation of arms. That insidious and interested Nobleman, void of attachment either to James or William, employed his emissaries to persuade the Clans that to sub mit to Government, till a fairer opportunity occurred to resume their arms, was the most acceptable service to the Court of St. Germain's. Suspicious that he meant to appropriate the money to himself, the Highlanders rose in their de- mands, and betrayed his advice to Government; but it was discovered, that they sought permission themselves from James to capitulate, with a design to resume their arms at his command. A severe Proclamation Avas therefore issued in August. They were required to submit to Government, and to receive the oaths and a free pardon before the first of January ; and to enforce the penalty of military execution, a winter campaign Avas projected through the Highlands. A plan suggested by Breadalbane's revenge, was adopted by the cruel policy of Dalrymple, to extirpate every Clan in Lochaber, that refused, or neglected to submit on the day prescribed. When the day approached, the Chieftains, in timidated or apprised of their danger, hastened to disarm the resentment of Government by their timely submission. Dundee, and Buchan's officers were"], [665, "G L E permitted to capitulate, and transported to France, where they Avere reduced to a company of private soldiers ; and, from the indigence and hardships sustained during their gallant services in Catalonia and Alsace, few of these unhappy exiles survived to revisit their native country*. \u2014 The last man to submit was Macdonald, of Glencoe. ToAvards the erid of December, he applied to the Governor of Fort William, who refused, as not a Civil Magistrate, to administer the oaths ; but dispatched him in haste, with an earnest recommendation to the Sheriff of Argyle. From the snows and other interruptions on the road, before he reached Inverary, the County Town, the day prescribed for submission had elapsed. The benefit of the indemnity was strictly forfeited ; the Sheriff was moved, however, by his entreaties and tears, to receive his oath of allegiance, and to certify the unavoidable cause of his delay. But his oath was industriously suppressed, by the advice particularly of Stair, the President; the certificate, was erased from the Lists presented to the Privy Council ; and it appears, that an exten- sive combination was formed for his destruction. The Earl of Breadalbane, whose lands he had plundered, and whose temporizing advice he had betrayed to government, was inured to the most atrocious massacres by the execution of letters of fire and sword against the Earl of Caithness, Avhose estate and titles he had formerly usurped. Dalrymple, the Secretary, had imbibed the bloody spirit of Lauderdale's Administration ; and, instigated by Breadalbane's resentment, expressed the most savage joy at an opportunity to extirpate a thievish Clan. They persuaded William, that Glencoe was the chief obstacle to the pacification of the Highlands. Perhaps they concealed the cir- cumstance that he had applied within due time for the oaths to GoArernment, which he had since received. But they procured instructions, signed, and for their greater security, countersigned by the King himself, to proceed to military execution against such rebels as had rejected the indemnity, and refused to sub- mit on assurance of their lives. As these instructions were found insufficient, they obtained an additional order, signed, and also countersigned by the King, e* that if G lex coe and his Clan could well be separated from the rest, it would \u25a0*** be a proper vindication of public justice to extirpate that sect of thieves.\" But the direction given by Dalrymple, far exceeded even the King's instructions. In his letters to the Commander in Chief, he recommended the cold and long nights of winter as the fittest season for execution, when the Highlanders could not escape to their hills with their wives and children, and, without houses, the human constitution was unable to survive, \u2014 regretted, that the other Clans in vol. i. 4 H"], [666, "G L E Lochaber, by their timely submission, had disappointed his vengeance, \u2014 directed, with the local knoAvledge derived from Breadalbane, that the Passes to Glencoe should be securely guarded, \u2014 and exhorted even the subordinate officers to be sudden and secret in the execution ofthe plan, not to trouble the Government with prisoners, nor to destroy the cattle and houses, Avhich might render the people desperate, unless the Avhole Clan Avere utterly extirpated. Such atrocious sen timents, uttered as usual Avith an ardent zeal for the public service, were com municated to the Officers with full effect. \u2014 Glencoe, assured of an indemnity, had remained at home unmolested for a month, when a detachment arrived from Fort William, under Campbell, of Glen-Lyon, whose niece Avas married to one of his sons. The soldiers Avere received on assurance of peace and friendship, and quartered among the inhabitants of this sequestered vale of Glencoe. Their Commander enjoyed for a fortnight the daily hospitality of his nephew's table. They had passed the Evening at cards together, and the officers Avere to dine with his father next day. Their orders arrived that night, to attack their defence less hosts Avhile asleep, and not to suffer a man, under the age of seventy, to escape their Swords. From some suspicious circumstances, the sons were im pressed Avith a sudden presentiment of danger, and discovered their approach; but before they could alarm their father, the Massacre spread through the Avhole vale. Before the break of day, a party entering as friends, shot Glencoe as he rose from his bed. His Avife was stript naked by the soldiers, who tore the rings with their teeth from her fingers ; and she expired next morning Avith hor ror and grief. Nine men Avere bound, and deliberately shot, at Glen-Lyon's quarters ; his landlord was shot by his orders, and a young boy, who clung to his knees for protection, Avas stabbed to death. At another part ofthe vale, the inhabitants were shot while sitting around their fire ; women perished with their children in their arms ; an old man of Eighty Avas put lo the sword ; another, who escaped to a house for concealment, Avas burnt alive. Thirty-eight persons were thus inhumanly massacred by their inmates and guests. The rest, alarmed by the report of musquetry, escaped to the hills, and were preserved from de struction by a tempest that added to the horrors of the night. While the end of the Glen was guarded by Duncanson, with a detachment from Fort. William, Hamilton, the Colonel, to Avhom the superintendance was entrusted, advanced with 400 men to secure the Eastern entrance, and complete the massacre ; but, from the inclemency ofthe night, was retarded beyond the appointed hour. When he entered the Glen at noon, an old man was the only victim that remained. But"], [667, "G L E the carnage was succeeded by rapine and desolation. The cattle were driven off, or destroyed. The houses, to fulfil Dalrymple's instructions, were burnt to the ground ; and the women and children, stript naked, Avere left to explore their way to some remote and friendly habitation, or to perish in the snows. \u2014 The out cry against the massacre of Glencoe, from the industry ofthe Jacobites, Avas not confined to Scotland, but resounded with every aggravation through Europe. Whether the inhuman rigour or the perfidious execution of the orders were con sidered, each part ofthe bloody transaction discovered a deliberate, treacherous, and an impolitic cruelty, from which the King himself Avas not altogether exempt. Instead of the terror which it Avas meant to inspire, the horror and universal execration Avhich it excited, rendered the Highlanders irreconcileable to his Government, and the Government justly odious to his Subjects. His friends endeavoured in vain, from his inadvertence and haste, to transfer the blame to his Ministers ; his Ministers, to vindicate the orders as strictly legal, or ana logous to letters of fire and SAvord, which the Privy Council had been accustomed to grant. But, when a second order, signed and countersigned by the King, Avith such unusual precaution, is combined with the impunity which his Minis ters enjoyed, no doubt can remain that, although the execution might exceed his intentions, the measure was not concerted without his knoAAledge and previous consent. No inquiry was made at the time ; no punishment was inflicted after wards, on the authors of the massacre. On the contrary, it is asserted that the Officers most active in the execution were preferred. The best, and perhaps the just explanation of the transaction is, that William, beset Avith Ministers inured to the sanguinary measures of the former Government, Avas betrayed for once into an act of cruelty inconsistent with his charcter, and with the mild and merciful tenor of his reign.\" \u2014 The House of Glencoe, the property ofthe Laird of Glencoe, is now occupied by Mr. Macdonald, of Achlrichatain. A fine road is now carried through the Glen, from Tyndrum to Fort William. See, Appin, and Rannoch. GLENCOTHE, v. TWEED'S-MUIR. GLENCROE, VALE, v. LOCH-GOIL-HEAD. GLENCROSS, in the Shire of Edinburgh : formerly a Chapelry, the Stipend ofwhich, in 1811, was \u00a335..8..11. in money, 10 bolls 2 firlots and 2 pecks of barley, 7 bolls 2 firlots . and 2 pecks of meal, and 10 bolls of oats ; the manse was repaired in a very complete manner, in 1793, and is a commodious and comfortable dwelling ; the glebe, Avith the garden, which is a good one, consists 4H2"], [668, "G L E of nearly five acres of ground, together with the privilege of grazing a coav Avith one farmer, and ten sheep or a cow with another : Patron, The Right Honour able Alexander Fraser Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee, Judge Advocate of North Britain. The Parish of Glencross Avas formed, in 1616, from part of the old Parish of Pentland comprehending the Barony of Fulford, and part ofthe Parish of Penycuick : and it comprises the valley of Glencross, with some extent of country, both on the North and South : the Northern division having been taken from the Parisii of Pentland, and the Southern, from the Parisii of Penycuick. In the vale of Glencross, upon the Northern side of Logan water, there Avas of old a Chapel, Which Avas dedicated to St. Catharine the Virgin; and Avhich was called St. Catharine ofthe Hopes or the Vale, in contradistinction to St. Catha rine's ofthe Kaims, in the Parish of Liberton. The Chapel of St. Catharine of the Hopes belonged to the Monks of Holyrood, and its ruin may still be seen. In 1638, it was disannexed from the Bishoprick of Edinburgh, when the Parisii was denominated Glen-Cross, from a dislike to Saints: and the Glen or Vale was so called, from a remarkable Cross, which has been erected there by pious hands; and which also gave a name to Cross-Houses. It is in the Presbytery of Dal keith, and Synod of Lothian and TAveeddale. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 390, and, in 1811, was 455. It is 1|- m. N. from Peny cuick. The greater part of this Parish is better adapted for pasturage, than tillage. There is a Market for Sheep at House-of-Mnir , in the end of March and beginning of April, and in the end of October : the custom drawn from this Market is paid to the Family of Glencross, and the Town of Edinburgh. Coals, and limestone, are abundant. At Castle- Law are some vestiges of ancient Camps : and an inscribed Stone, erected on Rullion Green, commemorates the battle of Pentland-Hill, Avhich was fought on the 28th of November 1666. Old Woodhouselee Avas formerly the property and residence of Hamilton, of Both well-haugh, and it Avas from this House that the Regent Murray so barbarously turned out the Lady of Hamilton to the inclemency of the Season ; the resent ment ofwhich Avas the cause ofthe Regent's death. About a century and a half ago, the ancient Tower of Fulford, the residence of Sir- David Purves, was repaired from the stones ofthis house, and its name waschanged to Woodhouselee which it still retains. Near Woodhouselee, on the borders of this Parish, Avith that of Penycuick, the Scene of that favourite and celebrated Scotch Pastoral, \" The Gentle Shepherd,\" is generally supposed to have been laid : and there is cer tainly a close coincidence between tb eactual Scenery, aud the local circumstances"], [669, "G L E mentioned in that beautiful Poem. William Tytler, Esq., of Woodhouselee, ancestor of the present worthy Proprietor, Avas a native of this Parisii : he is well known a\u00ab the Author of \"An Inquiry into the Evidence againstMxRX Queen of Scots,\" and of a Dissertation on Scottish Music, annexed to Mr. Arnot's History of Edinburgh, p. 624 : he also rescued from oblivion the \"King's Quair,\" a Poem written by James the First of Scotland, during his captivity in England : and proved, on incontestible evidence, that Allan Ramsay was the true author ofthe beautiful Poems, \" The Eagle and Robin Redbreast,\" and \" The Vision.\" At Greenlaw, in this Parish, Avas also born James Philp, Esq., Judge of the High Court of Admiralty ; a Gentleman noted and beloyed, for the mildness and urbanity of his mind and manners ; and remarkable for his bold and judicious commitment of Captain Palliser to prison, in 1754, for disobedience to the orders ofthe Admiralty Court.

This is an extensive Valley, Avhich terminates in a plain, at the West end of Loch Tay. The river Dochart abounds with salmon, and trout : as does also Loch Dochart, which is about 3 miles in length, and which forms the boundary between Strath -Fillan, and Glen Dochart. By the side of Loch Dochart, in the Pass between Glen Dochart and Strath-Fillan, is situate the lofty Mountain of Benmore, which is elevated 3903 feet above the level of the sea : it was formerly a Deer Forest, but is now converted into a Sheep Avalk. See, Rannoch. GLENDONWYN, v. WESTER-KIRK.

The Crown : The Church is old. It is in the Pres bytery of Auchterarder, and Synod of Perth and Stirling. The Resident Popu lation ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 149, and, in 1811, was 170. It is 6 m. S E. b. S. from Auchterarder. This Parish is about 6 miles in length, and 4\\ miles in breadth, and is situate in the middle ofthe Octiil Hills. It derives its name"], [670, "G L E from the river Dovan, which winds in a beautiful manner through a narroAV Glen, the soil of Avhich is tolerably fertile; but by far the greater part of the District is hilly, and appropriated to the pasturage of sheep. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, and perquisites. Fuel is in plenty.

It is in the Pres bytery of Loch-Carrori, and Synod of Glenelg. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (comprising the Districts of Glenelg, Knoidart, and North Mor'ar) was 2834, and, in 1811, was 2611. It is 188\u00b1 m. N. W. from Edin burgh. This Parish is about 20 miles in extent from North to South, and about the same number of miles from East to West. It is bounded on the North-West by the navigable and much frequented Sound, that separates the Island of Skye from the Continent of Great Britain. \u2014 In the District of Glenelg, there are two Vallies, through each ofwhich a river runs ; the Inhabitants reside in separate Villages on each side of those rivers ; their arable land extending along the banks, and on the declivity ofthe hills ; some of them also dwell on the side of Loch Hourn. In this District the soil is good ; part of it being a deep black loam, and part a sandy gravel, formerly the bed ofthe rivers, yielding excellent crops of potatoes and oats, and the hills affording good pasture for cattle. It is the property of Colonel Macleod, of Macleod. \u2014 In the District of Knoidart, the Inhabitants dwell in Villages bordering on the sea, along the sides of Loch"], [671, "G L E Hourn, and Loch Nevish. Here the soil is in general light, yielding crops of barley\", oats, and potatoes : the hills, though high, are mostly green to their summits, and afford excellent pasture for all kinds of cattle. It is the property of Macdonald, of Glengarry, and Grant, of Glen-Moriston. \u2014 The District of North Mor'ar is rocky, and mountainous, and is mostly adapted for the pas turage of cattle. It is the property ofthe Family of Lovat. \u2014 The air is moist, but not unhealthy. The Fisheries are prosecuted with success, especially in Loch Hourn. Game, and aquatic birds of all kinds, abound here. The old military Road, from Fort. Augustus to the Isle of Skye, Avhich passes through the Parish, is now deserted ; and, at the termination of the road, the ancient Barracks of Bernera are situate : formerly a considerable Military Station (erected shortly after the battle of Glen Shiel in 1722, and continued from that period 'till after the year 1745), but now unoccupied. There have been many Castles or Round to. vers in this Parish, two ofwhich are yet pretty entire. The Parochial School-house stands at the distance of a mile from the Church ; the Salary is 300 merks Scotch, which is paid by the Proprietor and the tenants of his estate, together with emoluments ; but the whole income does not much exceed \u00a320. Sterling. In the District of Knoidart, there is one ofthe Society's Schools, with a Salary of \u00a312. Sterling. The Fuel principally used here is Peats, which are seldom good, by reason ofthe rainy seasons, and the distance from the mosses. A line of road is now forming, under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commissioners, from the Bridge of Doe at Kaun-a-Krock, through Glen Cluny, Glen Shiel, and along the South Side of Loch Douich to the Ferry of Kyle Rhea, a distance of 36^ miles : and, it is hoped, that the recent purchase of the Glenelg estate will create an additional motive for its speedy completion. This road was originally called the Glen-Moriston road, but it is noAV denominated the Glenelg, or more properly the Glen Shiel road. See, Rannoch, and Glen-Moriston. GLEN-ERNON, v. TARLAND. GLEN FALLOCH, in the Shire of Perth ; and partly in the Parish of Killin. This.

GLEN FINNART, v. DUNOON. GLEN-FINN1N, in the Shire of Inverness ; and in the Parish of Glenelg. This is a narrow vale, at the head of Loch Shiel, through which the river Finnin flows between high and rocky mountains : and is noted for being the place, where The Pretender first raised the Standard of Rebellion, on the 19th of August 1745. GLENGABER WATER, v. MEGGET. GLEN-GAIRN, or GLEN-GARDEN, in the District of Kincardine O'Neil, and Shire of Aberdeen: an ancient Parish, now united to the Parisii of Glen- Muick: The Church, which is situate at the confluence ofthe water of Gairn with the river Dee, is about two miles North from the Church of Glen-Muick, and appears to have been dedicated to St. Mungo, from an annual meeting of the Parishioners on the 13th of January. It is 16 m. W. from Kincardine O'Neil. The greatest part ofthis Parish lies upon both banks ofthe Gairn, extending six miles North-West from the Church, Avhere the Upper parts of Tulloch begin, and separate it from the Parisii of Crathie : a small part of it, lying on the South side ofthe Dee, is called Strath- Gimie. Here are tAvo of the Society's Schools, which are highly beneficial. Game is in plenty, particularly on the hill of Morven. Lime-stone is abundant ; but, from the difficulty of getting fuel, very little of it is burned. Near The Pass of Ballatar, is an ancient Castle, which formerly belonged to the family of Forbes, and is now the properly of The Earl of Aboyne. GLEN GARREL, \u00ab. KILLSYTH. GLEN-GARRY, a District in the Shire of Inverness. This District occu pies the central part of the Great Valley Avhich extends from Inverness on the East coast to Fort William on the West, being bounded by mountains which are wooded to their bases. On the Western shore of Loch Oich is Glen- Garry, the elegant Seat and Estate of Colonel MacdonEll, almost surrounded with wood ; and not far distant is the ruin of the old Castle of Inver Garry, which was burned in 1745. The Highland Society and the Public Meetings of the County of Inverness having* concurred in opinion respecting the utility and import ance ofa line of road across the middle of the Highlands, and Colonel Mac donell being Avilling to defray a moiety of the expense, Mr. Telford, in his Report to The Commissioners for Highland Roads and Bridges, dated the 21st."], [673, "GLE of December 1803, observes, \" I examined the country which lies betAveen the Military road at each end of Loch Oich, and a branch of the Western Ocean called Loch Hourn ; the distance is rather more than 31-f: miles. This District has in the course of the last 20 years been changed from black cattle to sheep pasture. It is in general very rugged, and inaccessible; the intercourse is tedious, difficult, and dangerous, even to those who have been accustomed to the county. This road will immediately open the valuable vallies of Glen- Garry, and Glen Quoich, Avith various ramifications from them, and will afford an opportunity of opening connections with Glen-Moriston to the North-East, and Arkeg to the South-West. It will open a communication by land to the fishing ground of Loch Hourn, and may be connected with Bernera, either through Glen-Elg, or through Glen Shiel, and past the Shiel House, or by both of these lines of road. In this point of vieAV it is of the utmost importance as a Drove-Road, from a very extensive tract of country.\" In the month of December 1809, a fatal accident terminated the life of Mr. Dick, the acting contractor on this road, by his falling down a precipice on his way from Loch Houru to Ara- saig ; but by the exertions of his nephews, who succeeded him in the Avork, this great extent of road through a country where much rain falls, is satisfactorily and substantially completed ; and the bridges, though someAvhat rudely, are all strongly bnilt. Colonel Macdonell has also applied to The Commissioners to cause a line of road from Loch Nevish to Loch Quoich, and thence to the Rhie- buie line of road to be surveyed, with a vieAv to the formation of a bridle road ; and directions have been given accordingly.

GLEN-HOLM, in the Shire of Peebles: formerly a Rectory, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was \u00a3150., including 2 chalders of meal, and 1 chalder of bear ; the glebe consists of 6 acres of good land : Patron, The Marquis of Queensberry : The Church was re-built in 1775. It is in the Presbytery of Biggar, and Synod of Lothian and TAveeddale. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 242, and, in 1811, was 213. It is 7 m. N. from Beild. This Parish is be tween three and four miles in length, and nearly two miles in breadth. The surface is hilly, and by far the greatest part is sheep pasture : the arable soil in the vallies is loose and sharp, and, when well cultivated, affords a goood return, if not injured by the early frosts. The climate is damp. The Post road lo Dum fries runs through the lower part of this Parish ; Avhere, in the opening of a Strath, of about a mile in breadth, is a small river, called Holm's Water, which afterwards falls into the Tweed. The great distance from coals, is a considev- VQh. i. 41"], [674, "GLE able disadvantage. The Salary of the Schoolmaster is 300 merks Scotch, be sides the School Avages, Avhich are very low. Peat very good in kind, but at a great distance, on the summit of steep hills, and difficult of access, may be ob tained ; but this species of fuel is now only got by such ofthe Inhabitants, who by the impolitic service of thirlage, are obliged to furnish certain Mills with it ; and Avho accordingly cast a few on those heights, for the purpose of drying their grain at the Kiln. There are the remains of six old Castles or ToAvers, which appear to have been built in a very strong manner for shelter and defence, against the incursions of the English in the Border wars. There are also the remains of several Tumuli, and of Military stations both circular and rectangular. In the upper part ofthe Parish, there was formerly a Chapel, at a place called Chapel Gill.

This Parish is about 18 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth ; and takes its name from its local situation, being placed in a Glen through Avhich the riA'er Isla Aoavs. The soil is in general light, and stony ; though the lower district appears to be a strong loam, and very productive. The air is pure, and healthy. Limestone is abundant. The roads, and bridges, are in bad repair. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, and perqui sites: besides Avhich, The Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge have a School at Folda with a Salary of \u00a3 10. Sterling. The Castles of Forter, and Newtoicn, both of Avhich belonged to the Ogilvies, of Airly, were demolished, in 1641, by The Marquis of Argyle. Glen-Isla now gives the title of Vis count to The Duke of Argyle. GLEN-KENS, the Northern District of the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright. It comprehends the Valley which is watered by the river Ken, and part of the high lands that divide Galloway from Carrick ; and comprises the four Parishes of Carse-Fairn, Dairy, Balmaclellan, and Kells.

GLEN LOCH AY, in the Shire of Perth ; and partly in the Parish of Killin. This beautiful and sequestered Vale, lies in a North- West direction from Killin; and a considerable part of it is in the Parish of Kenmore, although some parts are no less than 28 miles distant from that Parisii Church. Such of the Inhab itants ofthis Glen, and other parts ofthe Parishes of Kenmore and Weem, as are adjacent to Killin, attend Divine Service there : they have seats in the Church of Killin, and when any repairs are wanted, either for the Church or Manse, they perform carriages, &c, as if they were Parishioners. Their Elders have a Seat in the Kirk-Session, and their Poor are chiefly supplied from the funds at Killin : it does not, however, appear, that their lands were formerly annexed, quoad sacra, to that Parish. Many of the Farms to the Eastward of the Village of Killin, for two or three miles along the North side of Loch Tay, depend in like manner upon Killin for Church privileges. This vale is about 10 miles in length, and is separated by a ridge of mountains from Glen Dochart, and Strath-Fillan, to which it runs parallel, and terminates in a pretty exten sive plain, at the West end of Loch Tay. The river Lochay abounds with sal mon, and trout. GLEN LUCE, v. LUCE, OLD, and NEW. GLEN LYON, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Fortingal. This is a very narrow Glen, 28 miles in length ; the sides being formed of some of the loftiest mountains in this County : it contains 28 villages, many of which have no sunshine, for three or four months in winter. In the head ofthe district the soil is good ; but the seasons are inclement, and the crops seldom attain to perfection. The hills afford excellent pasture for sheep. Loch Lyon is well stored with perch, and trout ; and from proceeds the river Lyon, which affords abundance of salmon. See, Fortingal, and Weem. GLEN-MAILEN, v. AUCHTERLESS. GLEN-MARKY, v.

Here are two ancient Burying- places, called Clachan an Inair, i. e. The Burial place ofthe LoAver part ofthe Valley, where the river Moriston discharges itself into Loch Ness ; and Clachan Merecheard, which is called after a Saint ofthe name of Mer echard. A Society Schoolmaster is established here, with a Salary of \u00a315., besides the usual accommodations. Here is a manufac ture of linen. Anoch, a small Village in this Glen, was visited by Dr. Johnson, in 1773, Avho Avas attended with great civility by the landlord. \" Some time aster dinner,\" says he, \" we were surprized by the entrance ofa young woman, not inelegant either in mien or dress, who asked us whether we would have tea. We found that she was the daughter of our Host, and desired her to make it. Her conversation, like her appearance, was gentle and pleasing. We kneAv that the girls ofthe Highlands are all gentleAvomen, and treated her with great re spect, Avhich she received as customary and due, and was neither elated by it, nor confused, but repaid my civilities without embarrassment, and told me hoAV much I honoured her country by coming to survey it. She had been at Inverness to gain the common female qualifications, and had, like her father, the English pronunciation. I presented her with a book, which I happened to have about me, and should not be pleased to think that she forgets me.\" Having left their host, whose favour Dr. Johnson had gained, he noAV most eloquently and beau tifully adds, \" As the day advanced toAvards noon, we entered a narrow valley not very flowery, but sufficiently verdant. Our guides told us that the horses could not travel all day without rest or meat, and entreated us to stop here, be cause no grass would be found in any other place. The request was reasonable, and the argument cogent. We therefore willingly dismounted, and diverted ourselves, as the place gave us opportunity. \u2014 I sat down on a bank, such as a writer of Romance might have delighted to feign. I had indeed no trees to whisper over my head, but a clear rivulet streamed at my feet. The day Avas calm, the air was sost, and all Avas rudeness, silence, and solitude. Before me, and on either side, were high hills, which, by hindering the eye from rang ing, forced the mind to find entertainment for itself. Whether I spent the hour"], [677, "GLE well I know not; for here I first conceived the thought of this narration.\" Ad mirable writer! with what particular delight is this narrative perused, by every reader of taste ! \u2014 An excellent line of road is now making, under the auspices of The Parliamentary Commissioners, commencing at the West side of Loch Ness, from Inver-Moriston , passes up Glen-Moriston, and preserving a West ward direction for upwards of Fifty miles through an improveable country, termi nates at Kyle Rhea, the usual Ferry from the Main-land of Scotland to the Isle of Skye. The numerous roads undertaken by the Proprietors in the Isle of Skye are dependent upon the Glen-Moriston road, for their future communication with Inverness and the rest ofthe Kingdom, and as the East end ofthis road forms a junction with the roads now making along the Great Valley of Scot land, by the side ofthe intended Navigation from Inverness to Fort William, it is manifestly desirable that the Glen-Moriston road should be made as soon as possible. To promote the general wish of the Counties of Inverness and Ross, and to facilitate dispatch, this line of road has been divided into separate portions : \u2014 1st. From Inver-Moriston to the Bridge of Doe, at Kaun-a- m. yds. Krock - - - - 14, 1190. 2nd. From thence to the Boundary of the Shire of Ross - 6, 150. 3rd. From thence to the Boundary or March of the Glenelg estate - - - - - - 27, 410. 4th. From thence to Kyle Rhea. - - 2, 1500. 50, 1490. There is the less objection to making the Glen-Moriston road in separate portions, as the deserted Military road frcm Fort Augustus to Bernera Barracks, preserving nearly the same line from the bridge of Doe to Glenelg, will serve to connect, though imperfectly, the disjoined parts which may first be executed. The work on the Glen-Moriston part ofthe road (14 m. 469 yds.) was reported, in 1811, to be completed with judgment and skill; and all the bridges are built and neatly finished, including the bridge of three arches over the river Moriston at Torgyle, the water- way ofwhich is 116 feet. Glen-Moriston is the elegant family Mansion of Patrick Grant, Esq. See, Urquhart, and Rannoch.

The soil is in general shalloAv, and early, producing good grain : but the arable land bears only a small proportion to the surrounding Mountains, which afford excellent pasture for sheep. The air is pure, and healthy. Fuel is expensive. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, together with a dwelling, and a rood ofland. About two miles East from the Church, on the North side of a hill of the same name, are the celebrated mineral Wells of Pananich, and where excellent accommodations are provided for the numerous persons Avho resort thither, for the benefit ofthe waters. Over the Muick is a beautiful stone Bridge, called The Bridge of Ballatar, which was built by subscription, and other contribu tions, under the patronage of the late Francis Farquharson, Esq., of Monaltrie; a Gentleman aa ho has left many useful and substantial monuments of his public spirit in this part ofthe Country. About a mile North-West from the Church, stand the ruins of the ancient Castle of The Cnoe, which now belongs to Mr. Gordon, of Aber geldie. At the Eastern extremity of the Parish, is Dee Castle, formerly called Candacorl, i. e. Tlie Head of the Wood, now also in ruins : it is said to have been built by the family of Gordon, and is now the pro perly of The Earl of Aboyne. GLEN-PROSEN, in the Shire of Forfar ; and in the Parish of Kirrie-Muir : Divine Service is performed in the Chapel here, only five or six times in the year. This Glen, Avhich constitutes the Northern part of the Parish, is about 12 miles long : and, Avith the tract of country that lies along the burn of Lednathie, Glen Uig, Glen Logie, and some smaller Glens which are comprehended under the general name of Glen Prosen, may contain from 24 to 30 square miles : it is altogether hilly, and mountainous. The soil is partly thin and light, partly mossy, and, for the most part, wet. Here is a considerable quantity of natural wood, principally birch ; and, if secured from the sheep, would soon become a Forest, as the upper part of it, which is still called The Forest of Glen Prosen,"], [679, "GLE has evidently been.

The Higher Part of the Parish consists of tAvo narrow Glens, Avhich extend betAveen two or three computed miles from the head of the well known arm ofthe Sea, called Loch Duich, and at the medium distance of one computed mile and a half from each other ; but the grazings occupied by the Inhabitants of those Glens, extend to the distance of eight computed miles more in the same direction of South-East, and are between 3 and 4 computed miles broad. The Lower part ofthe Parish, called Letter- Faim, xuns in the direction of North-West along Loch Duich, on the South, for the distance of six computed miles, and rises from the Sea, by a"], [680, "GLE pretty rapid ascent, to the medium distance of one computed mile and a half; so that the Parish is 16 miles long, and betAveen \\\\ and 4 miles broad. The moun tains rise to a prodigious height ; but the interjacent vallies are not unpleasant, though the proportion of arable ground is very inconsiderable. The climate is very rainy. Black cattle are the staple commodity ofthe Parish. Loch Duich abounds with fish, of various kinds. Here are inexhaustible funds of peat-moss: but, from the wetness of the climate, and the ruggedness of the mountains, fuel is scarce. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks, and perquisites. Shiel Inn is a Stage-House, on the military road from Fort Augustus to Bernera. The narroAV Pass of Glen Shi el is famous for the battle, in 1719, betvveen the English troops and the adherents of James the Second, led on by William Earl of Seaforth ; in which the Highlanders were defeated. The mountains appear to be composed of micaceous shistus, Avhich is sometimes alternated Avith horn blende slate, and veins of granite appear traversing these strata in various places. This valley is inhabited by the Clan of Macrae. The Macraes, as avc heard afterwards in the Hebrides, says Dr. Johnson, \" were originally an indi^ gent and subordinate Clan, and having no farms nor stock, were in great num bers servants to the Maclellans, who, in the war of Charles the First, took arms at the call ofthe heroick Montrose, and were, in one of his battles, almost all destroyed.

It is in the Presbytery of Lorn, and Synod of Argyle. The Resident Population of the Parish of Glen-Urchay, in 1801, was 1111, and, in 1811, was 993. It is adja- cent to Dalmally, on the North. The United Parishes are upwards of 24 mea- sured miles in length, but the breadth is very unequal : and, except the vale of Glen-Urchay, which forms a beautiful plain of 3 miles in length, and balsa mile in breadth, the plains of Auch, of Auchallader, and part of the lands of Hay field, the country exclusively is mountainous and hilly. The river Urchay winds in a gentle current through the vale, dividing it into two parts, till it falls into the beautiful expanse of water, called Loch Awe; on the sides of the river, the soil is a mixture of light earth and sand ; but on the banks of the Lake, it is gene^ rally deeper, and very fertile. The glebe, upon which the Church and manse are built, is a beautiful oblong Isle, formed by the river Urchay, opposite to the Inn of Dalmally ; it is in the centre ofthe Valley, and is upwards of a mile in circumference, and every where bordered with coppices and natural woods to the very edge of tlie river. The higher parts of the Parish formerly abounded with forests ofthe largest and best pines ; but these were cut down, many years ago, hy a Company of adventurers from Ireland, with little benefit to themselves, and less to the Noble proprietor of the estate : there are still, however, some tracts of natural wood, and, on the banks of Loch Awe, especially at Hayfield, VOL. 1. **"], [682, "GLE are extensive plantations of great luxuriance. The great Military road, from Stirling to Tvndrum, and Inverary, passes through the whole length ofthe Par ish ; as does also, for many miles, the Military road from Tyudrum to Fort Wil liam ; and it is in every other part well accommodated with good roads, and convenient bridges. On the confines of the Parish, is a Lead mine, now dis continued ; and which, by an Act ofthe Scotch Parliament, in 1424, was declared Royal, and to belong to the King, when three halfpence of sih'er could be fined from the pound of lead. Lime-stone, of good quality, is in plenty. The rains here are almost incessant. Fuel is expensive. By Act of Parliament, the tAvo farms of Inchrachan, and Phanans, are annexed, quoad sacra, to the Parisii of Muckairn, as '* maist ewart thereto:\" and for the same reason, the three Farms of Lealters, Corries, and Drishaig, were disjoinecLfrom Ardchattan, and annexed, quoad sacra, to Glen-Urchay.

There is also a School in the country District, established by The Society for propagating Christian KnoAV ledge, with a competent salary. Upon a Peninsula, at the East end of Loch Awe, stand the fine ruins of Castle Killchurn: it is said to have been built by the lady of Sir Colin Campbell, Knight of Rhodes, about the year 1440, while he was engaged in the Hoi**\" Wars: it was aftenvards much enlarged, and became the chief residence ofthe Earls of Breadalbane ; aud, in 1745, a part of it was garrisoned by the King's forces, in order to defend this Pass into the Highlands, and secure the tranquillity of the country. Upon a small Island, not far from Castle Killchurn, called FraochElan, are also the ruins of an ancient Castle; which little demesne, Avith its fortress, and some contiguous lands, were granted by King Alexander the Third, in 1267, to Gilbert Macnaughtan, the Chief of that Clan, on condition that he should entertain the King, whenever he passed that Avay. At Auchallader, in the upper part of the Parish, there is likewise another old ruinous Castle, formerly a Hunting-seat ofthe Breadalbane family; but, principally intended to restrain the incursions of such marauders as might attempt, in those predatory times, to pillage and despoil the country. In Glen- Urchay, the Chieftain of the Clan Macgrigor, a numerous and potent tribe, had long his principal residence, and a freehold property. For the enormities of some individuals, during the minority of James the Sixth, the Avhole Clan was proscribed by Act of Parliament, as \" Lawless Limmers, or Villains;\" even the"], [683, "GOG name was to be for ever abolished, and, at baptisin, no clergyman was to give it, under the penalty of banishment and deprivation. Happily those manners are no more! the legislature has some time since repealed these Acts, alleging that \" the causes inductive of them, for suppressing the name of Gregorox Mac gregor, are now little knoAvn, and have long ceased :\" and the Clan Macgrigor, now in possession of their name, and of every franchise of citizens, are as civi lized, as peaceable, and as much distinguished for every virtue, as any of their felloAV subjects. A remarkable and magnanimous instance of attachment and honour may not improperly be introduced here : \u2014 A person of the name of Mac-Ian, alias Kennedy, after the defeat of The Pretender at Culloden, watched over him Avith inviolable fidelity for several weeks, and even robbed, at the risque of his own life, for his support, at the very time that he and his family were in a state of starvation, and When he kne.v he could gain \u00a330,000. by betraying his guest : \u2014 This poor man was aftenvards executed at Inverness, for stealing* a cow ! in a very severe season, to keep his family from starving : \u2014 A little before his execution, he took off his bonnet, and thanked God, \" that he had never betrayed a trust, never injured the poor, anil never refused a share of what he had to the stranger and needy.\" \u2014 It is said, that George the Second was much affected, Avhen he heard ofthe fate of Mac-Ian ; and, with a Princely sentiment, declared, that, if he had known the circumstance in proper time, he would have put him in a situation, in which he would not have been tempted to steal a cow for his subsistence. The Chevalier had ordered him a little money, but poor Mac-Ian never received it ! \u2014 Hay field, the Seat of Mr. Macdougal, is pleasantly situate on the banks ofthe Lake. General Campbell, of Loch-Nell, Mr. Campbell, of Monzie, and Mr. Lindsay, of Boccaird, have also very elegant Residences here.

The Farm of Dunrobin, which is the largest in the Parish, is about 400 acres, and is highly cultivated. Dunrobin Castle, situate on an eminence near the sea, is the ancient and fine seat of the Earls of Sutherland, and Avas founded about the year 1100 by Robert or Robin, the second Earl.

GOLYN, in the Shire of Hadington : a Vicarage, anciently rated at \u00a34., and now comprehended in the Parish of Dirlton : The Church was dedicated to St. Andreio, and the ruins of it and the old Burial-place are yet remaining, about a mile and a half West from Dirlton. It belonged to the Monks of Dry burgh, and the Chapels of Congalton, Dirlton, andFidrey, were subordinate to it. It is noAV a small Village, situate on the Firth of Forth, at the distance of 5| miles S W. b. W. from North Berwick. See, Dirlton. Mr. Grose has preserved a view ofthis Church, Avho adds, that the last Vicar of Gulane is said to have been deposed by King James the Sixth, for the high crime \" of smoaking Tobacco,\" a weed which His Majesty deemed only fit for diabolical fumigations. Near this Church, stood a small Monastic foundation, which is said to have been a Cell to the Cistertian Nuns of Berwick upon Tweed, founded by King David the First. E.GOMETRAY, ISLAND, one of the Hebrides, and in the District of Mull, and Shire of Argyle : it constitutes part ofthe Parish of Kill-Ninian. This is a small Basaltic Island, separated from Mull by Loch Tuadh. It is inhabited, und has a Harbour on the North, and another on the South side ; both of which are safe and commodious for coasting vessels. See, Mull, Isle. GORBALS of GLASGOW, within the Jurisdiction ofthe City of Glasgow, and Shire of Lanark : formerly a Chapel of Ease to the Rectory of Govan, from which Parish it was disjoined, and erected into a separate Parish on the 21st of February 1771 ; there is neither manse, nor glebe : Patrons, The Parishioners: The Church was built in 1732, and an elegant New Church was built in 1811 ; and, from the increased Population, both those Churches are become neces sary for the accommodation of the Inhabitants ; and the old Church is likely to be erected into a Chapel of Ease. It is in the Presbytery of Glasgow, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 3896, and, in 1811, was 5199. It is situate on the Southern bank of the Clyde, opposite the City of Glasgow, and is occasionally subject to inundations. The ancient name of the Village was Bridge-End. At first, the Village and"], [686, "G O R Burying-ground onlv were erected into a neAV Parish, containing about 12 or 14 acres : but the lands of Rea, of Little Govan, and the Prebend of Polmadie, con taining about five or six hundred acres, and the Barony of Gorbals, belonging to the City of Glasgow, and Patrons of Hutchison's Hospital, and the Trades-House of GlasgoAv, containing upwards of 400 acres, were aftenvards, at the desire of the Inhabitants of these lands, annexed to the Parish of Gorbals by thc Presby tery of Glasgow. The air is rather moist. The soil varies from a deep rich loam to a barren sand. Coals are abundant. The Salary of the Parochial School, and the emoluments, is about \u00a380. per annum. In 1571, the Village and Barony of Gorbals were feued by George Elphinston, Merchant in Glas goAv, from Archbishop Porterfield. Near the South end of tho old Bridge, there Avas a Burying-ground, called The Lepers' Church-yard ; a House for Lepers having been founded and endoAved there, about the year 1350, by a Lady ofthe name of Campbell. About the middle ofthe Village, on the East side, is an old building called The Chapel, which is noAv under the Patronage of St. Ninian: the loAverpart of it is at present occupied as the Parisii School, and the tAvo upper stories are used as a Prison. GORDON, in the Shire of Berwick ; formerly a Vicarage, the Stipend of Avhich, iu 1811, Avas \u00a3150. Sterling : Patron, The CroAvn : The Church stands on the North side ofthe Village of West Gordon, near some remains of an an cient Fort, and is in decent repair. It is in the Presbytery of Lauder, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, (comprising the two villages of East and West Gordon, Avhich are distant some what more than a mile from each other) Avas 802, and, in 1811, was 851. It is 5jr m. S. W. from Greenlaw. This Parish is about 7 miles in length from East to West, but is unequal in its breadth, one half being about tAvo miles, and the other half about four. The surface is uneven, but most ofthe hills are under cultivation : there are many pieces of good arable land, some of it ofa clay soil, but in general light and sandy : there are several extensive bogs, and mosses, which supply fuel to the Inhabitants. The air is damp. The river Eden runs through the Parish from North to South, and the Blackadder flows on the North side, for a mile or tAvo ; both of these are small sreams, on which several corn mills are erected. The number of Heritors is Eight: but none of them are resident. The Poor are regularly supplied by a Meeting of the Heritors, Minister, and Elders, who assess the Parish half yearly for that purpose. The Roads are bad. Coals are brought from the Lothians at the distance of 24 miles. This Parish"], [687, "G O R was formerly of very great extent ; but has since been dismembered, and part of it called Durrington- Laws, annexed to Longfor-Macus, twelve miles distant : out of Gordon, about the year 1647, was also erected the Parish of West Stru ther, comprehending Bassendean, a Church and Parish, formerly in the Pres bytery of Melros. At Huntley Wood, Avithin the Parish of Gordon, there was a Chapel, which was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and the advowson ofwhich appears to have passed into the family of Home, during* the reign of James the Fourth. During the reign of David the Second, John de Spottiswoode built a Chapel, Avhich was called White- Chapel, at his Hamlet of Spottiswoode ; the ruins whereof Avere to be seen, until lately. The Church of Gordon was for merly an appendage to the Mother Church of Home : it continued in the hands ofthe Monks of Kelso until the Reformation. The Territory of Gordon, which was anciently of vast extent, appears to have been granted, during the reign of David the First, to an Anglo-Norman settler, who assumed from it the surname of Gordon. The Duke of Gordon is still Superior of some lands in the Parish : those of East and West Gordon, Huntley, and Huntley Wood, belonged in pro perty to his Ancestors ; one of whom, howeA'er, (Sir Adam Gordon, who was killed at the battle of Halydon-Hill, in 1333) having obtained very considerable possessions in the North, was thence induced to change his place of residence, and planted the principal branch of this Illustrious and Munificent Family, in the Shire of Aberdeen : but who are said to derive their two Noble titles of Duke and Marquis, from Gordon, and Huntley. There are two Farms in this Parish, called Rumbleton and Rumbleton-Law , which, tradition says, is a corruption of Roman- To ion and Roman- Town- Law : at the latter Farm, there were lately appearances of extensive fortifications on a Law or Hill, which are noAV all oblit erated by the plough, and inclosures made with the stones. At Huntley, there are some remains of walls, Avhich have the appearance of a Castle or fortified place. Near the Manse, appearances of fortifications still remain, and the place still retains the name of The Castles ; vA'here it Avould seem the Ancestors of The Duke of Gordon had formerly resided.

It contains 39 families ; of which, 11 are chiefly employed in agriculture, and 28 in trade and manufactures. GOURDIE, v. CLUNIE. GOURDON, in the Shire of Kincardine ; and in the Parisii of Bervie. It is 1^ m. S. from Bervie. This is a Fishing Village, on the German Ocean ; with a small Harbour, but it is neither convenient nor safe, being of difficult entrance, and much exposed to the violence ofthe South-East winds. It is subject to the Port of Montrose. GOUROCK, in the Shire of Renfreav : and in the Parisii of Innerkip. Here is a Chapel of Ease. It is 2 m. W. b. N. from Greenock. This is a considerable Village situate on a large Bay, in the Firth of Clyde, and is very convenient for trade, having sufficient depth of water for vessels of any burden, and good shelter. Here is au extensive Rope-work. The House of Gourock, is the agreeable resi dence of Duncan Darroch, Esq., the sole Proprietor ofthis estate. GOVAN, partly in the Under Ward, and Shire of Lanark, and partly in the Shire of Renfrew : formerly a Rectory, belonging to the Church of St. Mungo, of Glasgow ; the Stipend of which, before the late augmentation, was 4 chalders of bear, 4 chalders of oat-meal, and \u00a3600. Scotch, including the alloAvance for Communion elements : the manse, and offices, are in excellent repair : the glebe consists of upwards of 7 acres ; Patrons, The University of Glasgow : The Church was re-built in 1762, in a very commodious and substantial manner. It is in the Presbytery of GlasgoAv, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 6701, and, in 1811, was 11581. It is 2| m. W. from GlasgoAv. This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and between"], [689, "G R \u00c6 three and four miles in breadth, being intersected by the river Clyde, which is here navigable for vessels drawing %\\ feet water. On each side of the river a fine plain extends, about a mile and a half in breadth, which is adorned with beautiful Villas and flourishing Plantations. The soil varies from a light loam to a clay and till, Avhich, though not naturally fertile, is rendered tolerably pro ductive by the great improvements in agriculture. Near the confluence of the river Kelvin with the Clyde, there is a Ferry. Coals, free-stone, and brick-clay, are abundant. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, which, with the School -fees, and perquisites, and a mortification made in 1757 by Mr. Abraham Hill, for the education of 10 poor children, amount to upwards of \u00a340. Sterling per annum. On the lands belonging to Sir John Maxwell, Bart., of Pollock, are the remains of an old Gothic Castle, built in 1585 ; and which was, for a long time, the Jointure-House of the Pollock family. Upon an elevated situation, near the Kelvin, are the ruins of an edifice, erected in 1611, for the country residence of the Bishops of GlasgoAv, and still named The Bishop's Castle. GOWRIE, or THE CARSE of GOWRIE, a fertile District, in the Shire of Perth. This District extends 15 miles in length, and from 2 to 4 miles in breadth ; comprehending the rich carse lands on the North bank of the river Tay, between Dundee and Perth, and extending- NortliAvard as far as the foot of the Sidlaw Hills. It appears to have been formerly covered with water, but is now in a high state of cultivation. GoAvrie gave the title of Earl to the family of Ruthven, which Avas forfeited in the year 1600. GOWRIE, CASTLE, v. PERTH. GR\u00c6MSAY, ISLAND, one of the Orkneys : formerly a Vicarage, united to the ancient Rectory of Hoy : this Cure was formerly served by the Minister of Hoy, every third Sunday ; but the Church is noAv ruinous, and it is singular, that it pays neither Stipend, nor has any glebe. It is in the Presbytery of Cair ston, and Synod of Orkney. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 179, and, in 1811, was 190. It is 1^ m. S. from Stromness. This Island is about a mile and a half in length, and about a mile in breadth. The whole of it is level, and seems to be of an excellent soil ; that is either cultivated for the production of grain, or suffered to remain in old grass for the pasturing of sheep and cattle, as is most convenient. The interior parts ofthe Island, under a thin soil, contain a bed of schistus, or slate, through almost its whole extent ; which has hitherto been applied to no other use than to cover some country houses. vol. i. 4 L"], [690, "G R A The Inhabitants are distinguished for their strength and their stature, and excel much in fishing, for which their situation is admirable.

Scotch, including \u00a38. .6.. 8. for Communion elements, and 5 chalders of victual, two-thirds of which are payable in oat-meal, and the other third in bear : the manse, and offices, are in good repair: the glebe is small, and lies at the distance of more than two miles from the Church: Patron, The Earl of Mansfield: The Church was built in 1790. It is in the Presbytery of Annan, and Synod of Dumfries. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, (including the Villages of Rig, and Spring field) was 1765, and, in 1811, was 1749. It is 18 m. N. from Carlisle, and 318 m. N. N. W. from London. This Parish is supposed to derive its name from an eminence, which is about a quarter of a mile from the Church, and from whence there is a very beautiful and extensive prospect. It is about 6 miles in length, and 3 miles in breadth, extending along the coast ofthe Sohvay Firth: it is, in general, level, having few rising grounds, and these of small elevation ; and, with the exception of some tracts of moss and boggy ground, the soil is for the most part fertile, and well cultivated. The Sark, and the Kirtle, are the only streams in the Parish : the former ofwhich uniting with the Eden, and the Esk, constitute the head of the Solway Firth. The Firth is here from four to five miles in breadth, and is navigable to Sark-foot, for vessels of 120 tons bur den: there are also other harbours or landing-places, such as Red- Kirk- Point,"], [691, "G R A Brewhouses,&c, but on any part ofthe coast, which is a flat and sandy shore, vessels may lie in safety at all times. The tides flow regularly from West to East with great rapidity, for the space of three hours, and are nearly full at the Moon's Southing : the Spring-tides rise about 20 feet above low water mark, and there are evident indications of their having risen much higher at some for- mer period. The Fishery in the Firth is very productive. The climate is tem- perate, and healthful. In the village of Graitney Green is an exceedingly good market for butcher's meat : and from the great improvement in agriculture, the Parish not only supplies the Inhabitants amply with provisions, but exports con- siderable quantities to the English markets, and occasionlly to the Clyde. A Tryst is holden on the second Thursday in June, and Fairs on the 15th of September, or Monday after, the first Thursday after Falkirk Tryst in October, and the second Thursday in November. The Salary of the Parochial School is 300 merks Scotch, together with a good house and garden, and the usual school-fees ; the whole amounting to upwards of \u00a330. Sterling per annum. This Parish is united with Kirk-Patrick Fleeming in a \" Brotherly Society;\" \u2014 the object of which is, to provide a fund for the support ofthe labouring classes ofthe community, when they are rendered incapable of earning their livelihood, by sickness or old age : it is composed chiefly of labourers and mechanicks ; but several of the principal farmers in both Parishes have also become Members of it, with a view to its en- couragement, from their conviction of its being an excellent Institution, and, if properly conducted, may be productive of much advantage to a very deserving description of persons : Each Member contributes a small sum Quarterly, which is gradually accumulating into a Fund ; from whence every Member in distress draws a stated allowance weekly, according to the regulations of the Society ; and several of the Members have already derived much advantage from the Establishment. On the Farm of Graitney Mains, are the remains of a large Druidical temple ; the site of which is said to be famous, for having been the place where Alliances were anciently concluded between the tAvo Nations. There are also the remains of two or three square Towers, which seem to have been places of defence against the incursions of the English Borderers. Peats are the common fuel used here : but coals are brought from Archerbeck in the Parish of Canoby, at the distance of 10 miles, and also from the coast of Cumberland. The great roads from England by Moffat to Edinburgh, and to Glasgow, by Hamilton ; and from England by Dumfries to Port-Patrick, and to Glasgow by Sanquhar, pass through this Parish. And Graitney Hall being now fitted up in 4L2"], [692, "G R A a commodious manner as an Inn by The Earl of Hopetoun, the Proprietor, Post chaises and other accommodations may be procured here in a superior style. This Parisii has long been famous in the annals of Matrimonial adventure, for the Marriage of Fugitive lovers from England, which have been celebrated here. But, as all unqualified Persons Avho celebrate clandestine Marriages in Scotland are noAv, however, liable to be banished from the Kingdom for life, this improper practice is likely to be abolished. And tAvo persons, Avho Avere found guilty at Jedburgh, in 1812, have been banished accordingly. GRAMPIAN MOUNTAINS. This stupendous and seemingly impenetra- ble barrier, which, like a mighty wall, stretches along the Southern front of the Highlands, extends across the Island, from the District of Covval in the Shire of Argyle on the Atlantic, to Port-Letham in the Shire of Aberdeen on the Ger- man Ocean ; and there forming another ridge in a North- Westerly direction, extends through the Shire of Aberdeen to Moray, ancl the borders of Inverness. The height of the Grampian Mountains varies from 1400 feet to 3500 feet above the level ofthe sea, and several of them are elevated still higher. The Southern front of the first ridge has, in many places, a gradual and pleasant slope into a champaign country of great extent and fertility. The Northern side is more ragged in its appearance, and the huge masses are seen piled upon each other in the most aAvful magnificence. Here Galgacus waited the approach of Agricola, when the Caledonians are said to have received their almost total overthroAV. In the Shire of Forfar the Grampians run parallel Avith the Sidlaw Hills, from which they are bet .veen six and eight miles distant ; and these lofty ranges inclose within their bosoms, the extensive and fruitful valley of Strathmore . GRANDTULLY, in the Shire of Perth. This District belongs to the Parish of Dull, from which it is 6 miles distant, and is furnished with a Chapel, in which the Minister preaches occasionally. Towards the beginning of the Eighteenth Century, John Steaa-art, Esq., of Grandtully , mortified the sum of 20,000 merks Scotch, originally destined for the support of 12 poor men on his estate, of the Communion of the Episcopal church of Scotland, and appointed his own heirs, and the heirs of three other considerable families nearly allied to his own, Ad ministrators of this fund. About the year 1740, a handsome building was erected for the objects of the benefaction, near the great road tAvo miles beloAV Little Dunkeld : but the house did not answer the intended purpose, and the original destination Avas found to be in many respects inexpedient or impracticable. By accumulation of interest, the capital amounted at length to \u00a32600.

GRANGE, v. KILLCONQUHAR. GRANGE, v. STEVENSTON. GRANGE, v. TONDERGARTH. GRANGE, in the Shire of Banff : formerly a Chapelry, the Stipend of which, in 1811, was 1000 merks Scotch in money, and 25^ bolls of meal, at 8 stone, in- cluding \u00a38. .6.. 8. for communion elements ; the glebe consists of 5 acres of toler- ably good soil : the manse is in bad repair, but the offices are pretty good : Patron, Sir William Forbes, Bart., of Cragievar: The Church, which is dedi- cated to The Virgin Mary, is in a ruinous condition. It is in the Presbytery of Strath-Bogie, and Synod of Moray. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1529, and, in 1811, was 1441. It is 4 m. E. b. N. from Keith. This Parish takes its name from the lands, called The Davoch of Grange, given to it by the Abbots of Kinloss, to whom it belonged (being bestowed upon them by William the Lion, in the Twelfth century), and who had here a Castle, in which they frequently resided, being attracted by the beauty of the situation : this Castle, Avhich is now in ruins, Avas built upon the summit of a small mount, partly natural, partly artificial, and surrounded with a dry ditch, on the South side ofa rising ground, overlooking extensive haughs, then covered with wood, and the small river Isla meandring through them for several miles. The Gallow- Hill, an area of about 200 acres, makes part ofthe Davoch of Grange, and is so called, because it was the place of execution for criminals, who were tried and condemned in the Abbot's Regality Court ; and Avhich, Avith other Hereditary Jurisdictions, was abolished in 1748. This Parish formerly belonged to the Parish of Keith, and Avas erected into a separate Parish in the year 1618. It is 6 miles in length, and 5 miles in breadth, and contains about 16,000 acres. The low ground, except some mosses, is in general well cultivated, and the cultivation has extended nearly half way up the neighbouring hills : on the banks of the Isla, the ground having a fine Southern exposure, is tolerably dry and early ; but the North district is cold, wet, and unproductive, the soil being a poor clay, on a spongy mossy bottom. The Earl of Fife is the principal Proprietor : but Cap tain Innes, of Edingight, is the only residing Heritor. The Village, called"], [694, "G R A Nether Mills of Stryla, is a Mill town, and contains about 100 inhabitants. There are inexhaustible Quarries of the very finest lime-stone in almost every part of the Parish, Avhich is burnt Avith peats from the neighbouring extensive mosses. The spinning of linen yarn, and the manufacture of coarse linen, are much prac tised here. The Salary ofthe Parochial School is 300 merks, a rood ofland, and 10 merks Scotch of a mortification, besides School-fees, and a few small perqui sites. The arbitrary, and oppressive Mill Services are loudly complained of here. Braco was formerly the residence of the Ancient and Noble Family of Duff, Lairds of Braco, and Ancestors to The Earl of Fife. Thfe new Turn pike road, from Banff and Portsoy to Keith, runs through this Parish. GRANGE HILL, e. DYKE. GRANGE HOUSE, v. MONIFIETH GRANGEMOUTH, in the Shire of Stirling ; and in the Parish of Falkirk. As Scotland is almost divided into two parts by the Firth of Forth and the river Clyde, an idea Avas formed, as early as the reign of Charles the Second, of opening a communication between the East and West seas, through the medium ofa Canal. Surveys ofthe intended track were taken in 1723, by Mr. Gordon, Avho is well known as the Author ofthe \" Itinerarium Septentrionale ;\" in 1762, by Mr.MACKELL, at the expense of Lord Napier; and ultimately by Mr. Smeaton, at the request of The Board of Trustees appointed for the Encouragement of the Fisheries and Manufactures of Scotland. After various attempts, a Bill Avas sanctioned by Parliament, which gave powers for raising a stock of 1500 Shares of \u00a3100. each, for the purpose of making a Canal between the Forth and Clyde. On the 10th of July, 1768, this great work was begun under the direction of Mr. Smeaton. The operations commenced at the East end, and the late Sir Laurence Dundas, Bart., of Kerse, cut and removed the first spadeful of earth which Avas taken from the Canal. The Spade is yet kept in the House of Kerse, in memory of that transaction, which was the beginning of an undertaking, great in the design, and difficult in the execution ; but happy in its effects, and likely to be of unspeakable advantage to succeeding generations. On the 10th of July 1775, the Canal was fit for navigation as far West as Stocking field, which is within a few miles of Glasgow. About tAvo years afterwards a side branch was cut, by which vessels could go still nearer to Glasgow, and a bason, together Avith granaries and other buildings, were prepared : by this time the public Funds of the Company were exhausted, for the making of Canals being then in its infancy, in Britain, the manner of performing the business in the"], [695, "G R A easiest and cheapest way was not understood. In this languishing and unfinished state the Canal remained, till the month of July 1786, when the Managers, by the assistance of Government, Avere enabled to resume their operations. The work was conducted by Mr. Robert Whitworth, and on the 28th of July 1790, the Navigation from Sea to Sea was opened : thus, by the intervention of the Canal, a communication between the Eastern and Western seas being completed, the event was signalized by the characteristic ceremony of pouring a hogshead full ofthe water of the Firth of Forth into the river Clyde, amidst the shouts and approbation of an astonished multitude. When we consider the novelty of the undertaking, and the difficulty of the enterprise, we shall not be surprised to find that it was 22 years and 18 days in being finished. The Canal in its course passes through marshes, and over rivers, rivulets, and roads. There is a con siderable Aqueduct Bridge, which conveys it over the Glasgow and Stirling- Road, a little to the Westward of Falkirk. But the most magnificent Aqueduct is that of four arches, which conducts it over the river Kelvin, where the valley in which it runs is 400 feet wide, and the depth from the summit of the middle arches to the channel of the river is more than 65 feet. The side cut, Avhich has already been mentioned, Avas carried fonvard to within half a mile of Glasgow ; larger and more commodious basons were made ; suitable edifices were erected ; land was sold for building a Village, and the place is called Port Dundas, in honour of Thomas Lord Dundas. From this Port a junction is made with the Monkland Canal, which is a small cut that runs 12 miles into the country on the East of Glasgow, for the purpose of conveying coals into that City. The length of The Great Canal is 35 miles ; the collateral cut to Glasgow is 2| ; and that from Port Dundas to the Monkland Canal is one mile ; the whole being 38f miles. The summit ofthe Canal is 141 feet above the level of the sea. The number of Locks is 20 on the East, and 19 on the West. The length of the Locks between the gates is 74 feet, and the width betAveen the Avails is 20 feet. The medium breadth of the Canal at the surface is 56 feet, and at the bottom 27 feet. Vessels of 80 or 90 tons, properly constructed, may be navigated through, and are fit for voyages by sea. The tonnage dues are 2d. per ton for eA*ery mile, with some exceptions, respecting lime, &c. The Direction ofthe Canal is under a Governor, and Council in London, and a Committee at Glasgow, avIio meet monthly : they are chosen annually, by a General Meeting, which is holden in London in the Month of March. The extensive trade carried on through this Canal, soon suggested to Sir Laurence Dundas the propriety of building a"], [696, "G R A Village, and Quay, near the East end of it, upon his own estate. The place Avhich he fixed upon for this purpose, was the angle that is formed by the junc tion of the river Carron and the Canal: these were begun to be built in the year 1777 ; and the Village is now of considerable extent, and is called Grange mouth. Both the coasting and Foreign trade of this Port are very extensive : but, as it is subject to the Custom-House of Borrowstown-Ness, at the distance of eight miles, a great inconvenience is sustained by those who are engaged in commercial concerns.

It is situate on the great Road to Fort George, and not far from a good Bridge which is thrown over the river Spey. It is neatly built, with an elegant Town-House, over a Prison, agree able to the Jurisdiction Act, and under the sanction ofthe Sheriff of the Bounds. Provisions of all kinds are plentiful, and cheap. Here are two established Schools ; the Salary of one of them, in which the Latin and French languages are taught, is \u00a330. Sterling, exclusive of the emoluments arising from the office ; whereof \u00a310. is by way of gratuity from The Earl of Seafield ; \u00a310. as the Interest of mortified money, from the Presbytery of the Bounds ; and \u00a310. from the Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, together Avith an excellent dwelling house, at the expense of The Earl of Seafield ;\u2014 The other School is taught by a Woman, where young children are not only initiated in the first rudiments of letters, bnt the girls receive a foundation in the"], [697, "GRE various branches of female education. It is surrounded with excellent peat mosses. GRASSY WALLS, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Scone. This is a large Roman Camp, situate on the East side ofthe river Tay, about three miles North from Perth. General Roy supposes it to have been of suffi cient dimensions, to contain the whole of Agricola's army, after passing the Tay; and has given a plan of it, in pi. 12. The Farm of Grassy Walls has taken its name, from its situation within the earthen intrenchments. GRAY, HOUSE of, v. LIFF. GREAT MOOR, v. CASTLE-TOWN GREENBURN, v. NEWHILLS. GREEN CASTLE, v.

GREEN HOLM, one of the Shetland Isles ; and constituting part of the Parish of Tingwall. It is a small, uninhabited Isle, situate to the South-West of Scalloway. GREEN HOLM, LITTLE, one ofthe Orkneys; and constituting part of the Parish of Eday. This is a very small, uninhabited Isle, and is situate to the South of Eday. GREEN HOLM, MUKLE, one of the Orkneys ; and constituting part of the Parish of Eday. This is a small, uninhabited Isle, situate to the South of Eday, and is appropriated to the pasturage of cattle, and sheep. GREENLAW, in the Shire of Berwick: formerly a Rectory anc. Vicarage, the Stipend ofwhich, in 1811, was \u00a3150., with a manse, and a glebe of about 10 acres : Patrons, The Trustees of The Earl of Marchmont : The Church is in tolerable repair. It is in the Presbytery of Dunse, and Synod of Merse and Teviotdale. The Resident Population of this Parish, in 1801, was 1270, and, in 1811, was 1260. It is 36 m. SE. b. E. from Edinburgh. The Fairs are holden on the 22d of May, and on the last Thursday in October. A General Post-Office is established here. It derives its name from one of those detached Hills, which, in the South-East part of Scotland, are called Laws: The Hamlet of Old Greenlaw stood on the summit of one of those hillocks, which, from its superior verdure, during times of worse cultivation, was called Green-Law : vol. i. 4 M"], [698, "GRE this name was transferred to the Toavu of GreenkiAv, which stands North-West of it, seven furlongs, on a bend ofthe river Blackadder ; and, on the same side of the river, at some distance, EastAvard, stood the old Castle of GreenlaAV. The Manor of Greenlaw belonged to the ancient Earls of Dunbar, who were Patrons of the Church of GreenlaAV, and of the Chapel of Lambdene. Sir Patrick Home, who was the progenitor of the Home Family, held Greenlaw under The Earl of Dunbar, till 1435, Avhen the Earldom became annexed to the CroAvn. In the old Manor of Halyburton, there Avas a Church, as early as the Manor itself, and Avhich Avas rated at four merks. After Berwick had ceased to belong to North Britain, in 1482, the Courts of Justice were holden some times at Dunse, and sometimes at Lauder ; but, in October 1696, the Parlia ment declared the Toaaii of Greenlaw to be the Head Burgh of the Shire of Berwick, and Avhich it still continues. This Parish is between seven and eight miles in length, and, on an average, about two miles in breadth. The surface is in general level, but has several eminences, Avhichare of inconsiderable height: the soil in the South part of the Parish, is a deep strong clay, exceedingly fer tile ; but towards the North, it becomes Avet and spouty, and ofa very inferior quality : and, on the Northern Borders, it is only fit for sheep pasture : about one half of the Parish is inclosed, and two-thirds of it are arable. The climate is various ; and agues are not uncommon : it is, however, said to be a healthy district, and there are several instances of great longevity. About one-half of the Inhabitants live in the Town of GreenlaAV : the rest live in Farm-steads and detached Houses, and in a small Village, in the North part of the Parish : almost the whole ofthe Town is bolden in feu from The Earl of Marchmont, who is Superior. The nearest Coal, and Lime, are in Northumberland, about 20 miles distant. To the Nortlnvard, there is a Moss of considerable extent, from which the Inhabitants of the Town, and all who live in the North part of the Parish, are supplied with peats of a tolerably good quality. The Roads are good. Marchmont, the beautiful Seat of The Earl of Marchmont, is situate about tAvo miles North-East from the Town, and is surrounded with extensive Plantations. There are the remains of two Religious Houses, which formerly belonged to the Priory of Kelso ; as also did the Church of Greenlaw. About a mile North from the Town, an earthen Mound, with a ditch on one side of it, Avhich is known by the name of Herrits Dyke, runs across the Parish : from the cultivation ofthe country, it cannot now be ascertained, either what the height"], [699, "GRE ofthe mound, or depth ofthe ditch, originally were : but neither of them seem to have been considerable : about 60 years ago, it could have been traced 14 miles Eastward ; and, tradition says, it proceeded, in the same direction, as far as Berwick: it is supposed to have extended Westward to a place, in the Parish of Legerwood, called Boon, a Celtic word, signifying a Termination, ox rather the foot ofa hill, or water : but itis not known by whom, or at what time this mound was built, nor for Avhat purpose it was intended. On the 23d of April 1696, Sir Patrick Home, one of the most enterprizing characters of his age, was created Earl of Marchmont, Viscount Blassonbury, Lord Polworth, Red-Braes, and Greenlaw : all which places belonged to the Parish of Pohvorth, except Blassonbury, and Greenlaw : And Marchmont is merely the modern name of Red-Braes, Avhich was changed to Marchmont, the family Seat. , .-\u25a0-;\u25a0_; GREENOCK, in the Shire of Renfrew: a considerable Sea-port Town on the Firth of Clyde, in which are tAvo Parishes : the Stipend ofthe Old Parish is, perhaps, the best in Scotland, the glebe alone producing some hundred pounds a year of feu-duties : the manse is in good repair : Patron, Sir John Shaw Stewart, Bart. : The Church is in good condition. \u2014 The Stipend of the New Parish, before it was augmented, was \u00a3105., together with a manse, and garden : Patrons, The Heritors, and Kirk Session : The Church was built in 1759. \u2014 It is in the Presbytery of Paisley, and Synod of Glasgow and Ayr. The Resident Population of this Town, and Parish, in 1801, (including the Village of Crawfurd's-Burn, and part of the Village of Garvock) was 17,458, and, in 1811, was, For the East Division - - 2881. For the Middle Division - - 7536. For the West Division - - 8625. 19042. It is 65 m. W. from Edinburgh. The Market is well supplied. The Fairs are holden on the first Thursday in July, and the fourth Tuesday in November. A General Post-Office is established here. It is a Burgh of Barony, erected by Sir John Shaw, in 1757, who .vas then Superior, and is governed by a Council of9Feuers, two of Avhom are annually elected Baillies. Its revenue is very considerable. The Town is irregularly built along the West side of the United 4M2"], [700, "G R I Bay of Greenock and Crawfurd's-Dike, formerly called Tlie Bay of St. Lau rence, from a Chapel near it, Avhich was dedicated to that Saint. The Harbour is very commodious, having sufficient depth of Avater for vessels ofthe greatest burden, and adjoining to it, are several dry Docks. The Foreign, and Coasting- Trade, is very considerable, and the Fisheries are prosecuted Avith great success. It is subject to the Jurisdiction of the Custom-House at Glasgow. Here is a private Banking Company, and also a branch ofthe Paisley Bank. The Mer chants' House Society, a charitable Institution, Avas established in 1787. \u2014 Previous to the year 1745, the Toavii of Greenock, and the neighbouring district, Avere included in one Parish ; but, about that period, the ToAvn and Suburbs, and the adjacent village of CraAvfurd's-Dike, Avere erected into a New Parish, which extends along the Firth of Clyde something more than an English mile, and is nearly an eighth part ofa mile in breadth. \u2014 The Old Parish, Avhich was disjoined from Innerkip and Houston in 1636, extends about 4| miles along the Firth, and is indented by several convenient Bays. Except a strip of level ground along the shore, the surface is hilly, agreeably diversified, and Avatered on the South by the river Gryfe. Upon the coast, the soil is, in general, light, sandy, and mixed Avith gravel ; but toAvards the hills, it becomes clay, and till; and on their summits, the surface presents either the bare rock, or is sparingly covered with heath or moss. Free-stone is abundant ; and some strata of infe rior lime-stone have been discovered. The climate is rainy, but not unhealthy. About a quarter of a mile South-West from Capellow, axe the remains of the old Castle. Sir John Shaav Steaa'art, Bart., is proprietor of the greatest part ofthe Parish, and has a large and elegant Mansion here. Greenock is in the Latitude of 55\u00b0 56' 56\" North, and the Longitude of 4\u00b0 44' 30\" West from the Royal Obser vatory at Greenwich. GREENYARDS, v. CROMARTY. GRENAND CASTLE, in the District of Carrick, and Shire of Ayr ; and in the Parish of Maybole. This Castle is situate upon the summit of a rock, over hanging the Atlantic Ocean, and appears to have been intended as a place of security against any sudden surprise, rather than a constant residence. Mr. Grose has preserved a view of it. GRETNA GREEN, v. GRAITNEY. GREY MARE'S TAIL, v. MOFFAT. GRIMSAY, ISLAND, one ofthe Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness :"], [701, "G U E it constitutes part of the Parish of North Uist. This is an Island only at high water; it is tAvo miles in length, is very barren, and covered with heath : but is very valuable on account of its kelp shores. It is in the possession of Mr. Maclean, of Boreray, and is included in the long lease granted to his ancestor by the Noble Family of Macdonald. GRINNAN HILL, in the Shire of Perth ; and in the Parish of Muthil. Upon the summit ofthis Hill are the remains of an ancient Camp, of Avhich General Roy has given a plan in pi. 31. It is \u00a7 m. S. W. from the Station at Ardoch. GRISKAY, ISLAND, one of the Hebrides, and in the Shire of Inverness ; it constitutes part of the Parish of Barray, and is uninhabited. Here is one of the Danish Duns. It is noAv the Property of Colin Macdonald, Esq. The en trance to the Harbour of Ottirvore, which is more properly a road than a har bour, is from the East, between the Islands of Griskay and Gigay, and is rauch frequented by ships to and from the Baltic. GRISSIPOL, v. COLL, ISLAND. GROAY, ISLE, one ofthe Hebrides, and inthe Shire of Inverness : it con stitutes part of the Parish of Harris, and is situate in the Sound. It is unin habited. GRUTNARD, ISLE, off the Shire of Ross. This Isle constitutes part ofthe Parish of Loch Broom, and one third of it belongs to the Shire of Cromarty. See, Cromarty.

GUAHALL, or GUEL, ISLE, one of The Scilly Islands. This is a very small Isle, containing only 10 acres ; and is situate to the Westward ofBrehar. GUAL VEARAN, PASS, v. RANNOCH. GUERNSEY, ISLAND, in the English Channel. It is 26 miles West from"], [702, "G U E the coast of Normandy, and 60 miles South-West from Weymouth, in Dorset shire. This Island is about 8 miles in length, and 6 miles in breadth, and con tains about 32,000 square acres. The air is particularly salubrious, and its soil does not admit noxious animals. Although the surface is mountainous, it never theless yields plenty of verdure, and corn and Aegetables of all kinds. It abounds with game, and fish, especially a fine sort of carp. There are no Avoods, and fuel is scarce, and expensive. The Island is well fortified by nature with a ridge of rocks, one of which abounds Avith emery, that is used by lapidaries in the polish ing of stones, and by various other artificers. Port St. Pierre, on the East side of the Island, has a good road, from whence Ships may go out with any wind ; they pass from it under the guns of Castle Cornet close up to the Town Avithin the Pier, Avhich is a noble work, formed of vast stones to a considerable height, in the beginning of the reign of Edward the First. The Town of St. Pierre is the only one in the Island, but it is too much confined between the sea and the ad jacent hills. It has a good Market, and a handsome Hospital, built in 1741, for the poor and sick. The staple manufacture is knit stockings ; and it carries on a considerable trade with all parts of the world. Castle Cornet stands upon a rock bearing East by South from the Town and Harbour of St. Pierre, and commands the channel near this part of the Island, which is 600 yards wide, and fordable only at low Avater in spring tides : It Avas formerly the residence of the Governors of Guernsey, until demolished by the blowing up ofthe magazine by lightning, on the 29th of December 1672 ; when the Dowager Lady Hatton, and Lady Hatton, wife of the Governor, together Avith several other persons, were killed by the explosion. At what time this Castle was constructed, is uncertain : tradition makes Robert Courthose the founder of all the Castles in this and the neighbouring islands, though in all likelihood they were not entirely destitute of fortresses before his time ; but very little of its original form and appearance now remains, from the numerous repairs and additions which it has undergone, and especially the demolition ofthe large Tower by the dreadful ac cident in 1672. This Castle has sustained many sieges and attacks : in the reign of Edward the First, the French invaded Guernsey, and took Castle Cor net, which was obliged to surrender for want of provisions and ammunition ; but the invaders were soon repulsed, and the castle re-taken by the inhabitants. Soon after Edward the Third assumed the title of king of France, it was again taken by one Maraus, a Frenchman, and holden for three years. In 1372, the"], [703, "G U E Island is said to have been ravaged by one Evans of Wales, an adventurer, at the head of a crew of Pirates : an ancient Poem relating this invasion is still preserved in the Island, but it is silent as to the part Avhich the castle had in that transaction. This Castle was also twice attacked by the soldiers of Oliver Cromwell, and the second time sustained a long siege until their provisions were entirely exhausted, when the garrison surrendered on honourable terms. At the Revolution a regiment was quartered in this and the adjacent Islands, part of Avhich had possession of Castle Cornet; but by the contrivance of the Magistrates of St. Peter's Port, and the defection of some of the Protestant officers in that, corps, the Popish part of the garrison were disarmed. Very con siderable repairs and additions were made to it in the reign of Queen Elizabeth ; it has since been converted into Barracks, and the garrison duty is performed by troops sent from England. About 30 years ago, a strong and extensive Citadel was built on an eminence in St. Martin's Parish. Upon a survey ofthis Island by Lord Dartmouth in the reign of Charles the Second, a place was found to the North-West, and more in the Channel, for making another Port or Mole, which would have admitted large Ships of Avar, and was to have had a Citadel, but the undertaking was thought too expensive. Abouta mile North from the town of St. Peter, stands The Marsh Castle, so called from its low marshy situation ; it is of an oval figure, consisting of a Keep and two other areas, the walls being about ten feet high, moderately thick, and commanded by an emi nence on the West, St. Michael's Castle stands in that part of the Island, called The Vale, upon an eminence near the sea ; and has four Round Towers and a double ditch, inclosing about an acre of ground : its origin is uncertain ; it is, however, mentioned as early as the year 1111, inthe Manuscript presened in the Island, called la Dedicace, 'which records the consecration of their Churches: Remont Sauvage, Governor and Captain of The Castle and Par ish of Tlte Vale, being therein mentioned as attending the Consecration of The Vale Church: It is also mentioned in the popular Poem, reciting the Piratical Invasion of Evans the Welshman, in 1372; wherein it appears, that Edmund Rosse was the Governor ofthe Castle, which is styled The Powerful Castle of The Archangel ; at present it is the property of the Crown. Near the Castle of St. Michael, is The Vale Church, consecrated on St. Michael's day in 1117; it Avas distinct from the Abbey of St. Michael, although it stood very near it, and Avas the property of the Parishioners ; a Court is holden here for the Manor of"], [704, "G U E St. Michael, ofwhich the Proprietor is Seneschal ; as a building this Church is extremely singular, its Tower, as well as Spire, lessening pyramidically. On point la Val, are many remains ofthe foundation of \" The Abbey of Archangel, in the Parisii of The Vale, in the Holy Island called Guernsey The Blessed.\" The Church of St. Sampson stands somewhat less than two miles North from St. Peter's Port, near an arm of the sea : it was built at the command of An thony le Sufan, Bishop of Coutance, and by him consecrated in the year 1111, according to the manuscript la Dedicace : it still retains evident marks of great antiquity, although it has at different times been much repaired. Guern sey is chiefly remarkable for its small breed of cattle. After the death of Henry the Sixth, Sir Richard Harleston, Vice Admiral of England, coming to Guernsey with a fleet, starved the Castle into a surrender. While this Island, and Jersey, made a part of the Diocese of Coutance, our Kings frequently threat ened to annex it to some English See : King John thought of Exeter ; and Henry the Seventh had obtained a Bull from Pope Alexander the Sixth, in favour of Salisbury ; and then got a second, to transfer it to Winchester. The reason therein assigned is, the danger of the French visiting them at pleasure under the pretence of Spirituals : it is added, that, for the like reason, Calais, then in the hands ofthe English, had been exempted from its Metropolitan, the Archbishop of Tours, and annexed to Canterbury : but this Bull, now in the Register of Archbishop Langton, remained without execution : However, in 1568, the 10\u00b0 of Elizabeth , the separation Avas effected, and the Islands annexed, as they still continue, to Winchester. The Geneva Discipline remained in Guernsey, Alderney, and Sark, until the Restoration : at present the Liturgy of the Church of England, translated into French, is universally used. By a Return into the Exchequer, in pursuance of a writ dated the 1 1th of July, 27\u00b0 Hen. VIII., directed to Thomas Compton, Lieutenant ofthe Island, and James Guille, Bailiff there, it appears, that the following Spiritual promotions in the Deanry of Guernsey were given in upon Oath at the following annual values, \u2014 .

The Deanry, Avhich is about \u00a3200. per annum, is in the gift ofthe Governor, as are all the Benefices, which are very small. The Churches are strong, well built, and neat. The Convention of the Estates here, as in Jersey, consists ofthe Governor, Avith the Coroners as appointed by King John, Jurats, Clergy, and Constables. The Governor has a negative voice, until the pleasure of His Majesty be known. The Law is the Custom of Normandy, with additional Constitutions by King John, and ordinances of Henry the Seventh, and other Sovereigns of England, whereby they are exempted from Suits in, or Writs from, Westminster Hall: and that no Commissioners, except under the Broad Seal, shall have power to act there, and those only with the concur rence ofthe Bailiff and Jurats as to the Laws and Customs ofthe Island. The privilege of a free trade, in time of tear, was extended to all these Islands by the joint concurrence of the neighbouring Princes, and confirmed by a Bull of Pope Sixtus the Fourth, which is recited at length in an inspeximus of Henry the Eighth : But the Islanders themselves, by the depredations of their Priva teers, have rendered the privilege of no effect. Guernsey gives the title of Baron to the Ancient and Noble Family of Finch, Earl of Aylesford. See, Jersey, Island. GUILSTON HOUSE, v. NEWBURN. GULAN, v. GOLYN. GULBERWICK, in the Mainland, and in the Shire of Orkney and Shet land : an ancient Parish, constituting part ofthe Union of Lerwick. It is situate to the Southward of Lerwick. This Parish is about 5 miles in length, and 2 miles in breadth, and is principally inhabited by Fishermen. It is very vol. i. 4 N"], [706, "GUT mountainous, and covered with heath ; the few patches of arable ground lying near the sea. GUMSCLEUGH, v. TRAQUAIR. GUNISTER, ISLE, one ofthe Shetland Isles ; and constituting part ofthe Parish of North-Maven. It is situate to the Southward, and is appropriated to the pasturage of cattle, and sheep. GUNNA, ISLAND, one of the Hebrides, and in the District of Mull, and Shire of Argyle. It lies in the Sound between Tir-Y, and Coll, and consti tutes part of the Parish of Tir-Y. This Island is about a mile in length, and half a mile in breadth, and affords great quantities of sea- weed upon its shores. GUTHRIE, in the Shire of Forfar : formerly a Collegiate Church, the Stipend of Avhich, in 1811, was 23 bolls 3 pecks of meal, and 14 bolls 3 firlots 3 pecks of bear, and \u00a357.. 4.. 2. Sterling in money: the manse is modern, and after a good plan : the glebe consists of about 5 acres : Patron, John Guthrie, Esq. : The Church is an ancient building. It is in the Presbytery of Aber- Brothock, and Synod of Angus and Mearns. The Resident Population ofthis Parish, in 1801, was 501, and, in 1811, was 556. It is 8 m. N. W. from Aber- Brothock. This Parish is divided into two parts, by the intervening of other Parishes ; the Southern part, called Kirk-Buddo, being about 6 miles distant from the Northern one ; it contains about 2700 acres, of which 1820 are arable, and Avell cultivated. The Salary of the Parochial School, exclusive of Kirk dues and School-fees, is the minimum, and two bolls of meal instead ofland : but the Southern part of the Parish is too distant to derive any advantage from the School. The Northern part is supplied with coals from Aber-Brothock ; and the Southern part procures peat from a moss, part of which is in this Parish. The Church was made Collegiate by Sir David Guthrie, of that Ilk, who was Lord High Treasurer in the reign of King James the Third; for a Provost, and three Prebendaries, the number of which was afterwards increased by Sir Alexander Guthrie, of that Ilk, his son and heir, who was slain at the battle of Floddon, in the year 1513. Henry Guthrie, Bishop of Dunkeld, is said to have been descended from a younger son of this ancient Family. Bishop Henry Guthrie wrote Memoirs, or a History of his own Times, from the beginning of the Civil Wars to the death of King* Charles the First, which has gone through several editions. John Guthrie, of Guthrie, Bishop of Moray, and a Privy"], [707, "GUY Counsellor for Scotland in the reign of Charles the First, was a man of great abilities and distinguished resolution. He was the only one of the Scotch Bishops, who did not renounce Episcopacy, or fly his country. He wrote a Diary MS. The Castle of Guthrie, Avhich is supposed to have been built by Sir Alex ander Guthrie, is a strong edifice : it is still entire, and is a memorial of the ancient grandeur of that Family. There is now an excellent modern House, close by the Castle on the East, and nearly on the South march of the Barony, which is the Residence of John Guthrie, Esq., of that Ilk. GUYND, v. CARMYL1E.
