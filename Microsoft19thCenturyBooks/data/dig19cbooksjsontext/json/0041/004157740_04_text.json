The Domesday Hundred of Ruesset, or Reweset, was done away with in the time of Henry I., but nearly replaced by the Hundred of Ford. The great feature of this change was that Alberbury ceased to be, and Ford became, the Caput of the Hundred. \"What with this and later changes, the modern Hundred of Ford is found to be coextensive with the Domesday Hundred of Ruesset, except in the following particulars. \u2014 Dinthill, Great and Little Hanwood, Preston-Montford, Wood cote, and Half of Onslow were in Ruesset Hundred, but are now in the Liberties of Shrewsbury. Bausley, originally a Ruesset Manor, has been annexed to Montgomeryshire. On the other hand, Ford Hundred has gained the township of Gatten, which, as origi nally a member of Worthen, must have been in the Domesday Hun dred of Witentrei. Gatten, as subsequently connected with Stitt and Ratlinghope, must have been for a time in Purslow Hundred ; but when Haughmond Abbey was dissolved, all older associations were forgotten, and Gatten was, very anomalously, annexed to Ford Hundred. Besides Gatten, two other townships of the original Manor of Worthen have to be noticed. These are Heath (Upper and Nether) and Habberley Office ; and both have been annexed to Ford Hundred, under what circumstances, or when, I know not. The Presentments of Ford Hundred at the Assizes of 1203 relate only to recent murders, the outlawry of the Murderers, and the value of their Chattels. At the Assizes of 1221, the Jurors reported of the remarriage of a Widow, and the Advowson of a Church, both which were in the King's gift. These topics will recur elsewhere. At the Inquest of 1255, Roger fitz Erm is the only Juror of this Hundred whose name (as printed) I am unable to associate with any definite locality. Thomas Hort (or Hord, as I think the name should be written) was a defaulter in respect of due attendance. 1 a VII."], [16, "2 TABLE OF THE DOMESDAY Manors situated in Ruesset, but whose Domesday- Name.

The Bailiff of the Hundred appears at this time to have held his Office by payment of 6| merks (\u00a34. 6s. 8d.) per annum to tbe ex istent Sheriff.1 At the Assizes of 1256 the Hundred was represented by its Bailiff (Thomas de Lecton) and 12 Jurors. Among the latter was Roger fitz Iwe, and among the Defaulters was Griffin fitz Eynon, whose estates in the Hundred I have been unable to identify. At the Assizes of 1272 Roger de Legh was Chief Bailiff of Ford Hundred. Among the Jurors was Roger fitz Mayow, and among the Defaulters was Cadugan ap Howel, but where these persons had any freehold I cannot say. The Inquisition of Ford Hundred, taken at Shrewsbury on Nov. 27, 1274, states the existent ferm of the said Hundred to be only 5 merks (\u00a33. 6s. 8d.). With the exception of this Ferm, the rights of the Crown are spoken of as having been unduly asserted or wan tonly and venally exercised by provincial Officers. The Hundred- Court had indicted Philip and Richard, sons of Thomas Hord ; but John Baril (Undersheriff) had released them for a fine or bribe of 100s. John Filcot and William de Trompiton, former Beadles of the Hundred, had been used, in cases where Inquests had been sum moned by Royal mandate, to amerce non-attendant Vills, though the said Inquests had been sufficiently taken by other Vills forming a quorum. John de Tron, John de Herefordshire, and John de Staffordshire, Sub-beadles of the Hundred, had enforced other un just levies and exactions, specifically on the Vill of Longden, and on a Tenant of Robert Corbet.3 At the Assizes of 1292, Richard de Pontesbury appeared as Chief Bailiff of Ford Hundred, and was put in misericordid for repeated trespasses. Alan Sprengeshose, Philip Hord, Roger de Bassechyrch, and John Fylecok, are named as his predecessors in office. Among the twelve Jurors there are three whom I cannot associate with any specific locality in the Hundred. These are Roger le Milde, Roger de Marscote, and Thurstan de Knapton. 1 Rot. Hundred.

Alretone is described in that Record as follows. \u2014 \"The Earl himself holds Alretone. Roger (holds it) of him. King Edward held it (in Saxon times) . Here are xx hides, geld able. There is (arable) land (enough) for xl ox-teams. That land, except ii hides, was waste (when it came to the existing owner). In demesne there is one Ox-team ; and v Villains, with one Free man, have in ox-teams; and certain Welshmen, here tilling the ground if abor antes) , pay rents of 16s. The woods are two leagues (leuuedes) in extent. There is waste land here forxxxi ox-teams.\"1 \" In this Manor five Knights of Roger (the EarPs Tenant) have six and a half ox-teams in demesne ; and n villains, vi boors, n Welshmen, and one Radman, with in Boors2 and vi neat-herds, have, among them all, in ox-teams. In King Edward's time, the Manor used to pay 8s. (per annum). Now it pays altogether \u00a34.\"z This entry occurs in a series of twelve Manors which Domesday enumerates consecutively, as having been Demesne-Manors of Ed ward the Confessor. The List seems to have been drawn up on a further general principle, viz. that these twelve Manors belonged in some sort to the Palatine demesne of the Norman Earl. The details however show a departure from that principle, for the Earl had granted Alretone and three other entire Manors out of the twelve to his vassals. The respective Hundreds of these twelve Manors are not declared in Domesday, except where the Manor happened to be the Caput of a Hundred. This was not the case with Alretone. We have therefore to ascertain the Hundred in which Alretone stood by indirect evidence. This is soon done. \u2014 Alretone follows Minsterley and precedes Alberbury in Domesday Book. Knowing that the Domesday Hundred of Ruesset is, in all its prominent and ascertained features, represented by the subse- Undertenants of the Radman ; a remark worth making, because it is the text of Domesday that best determines the rela tive conditions of these husbandmen. 1 That is, I presume, for thirty-one teams over and above the forty teams which the arable (or cleared) land would employ. 3 Domesday, so. 253, b, 1. 2 The three Boors, then, were clearly 1 b VII."], [20, "6 CAUS, FORMERLY ALRETONE. quent Hundred of Ford ; finding also that Minsterley is now in Ford Hundred, we conclude it to have been in Ruesset. Alber bury (also in Ford Hundred now) we know to have been in Ruesset Hundred from the direct evidence of Domesday. If then Minsterley and Alberbury were in Ruesset Hundred, it follows that Alretone (the intermediate Manor) was also in Ruesset Hundred, and must now be looked for in the modern Hundred of Ford. But Ford Hundred has no such Manor as Alretone. Alretone is, in name, therefore lost; and we have, in its stead, and equal to it in all conditions of magnitude, situation, and subsequent importance, the Manor of Caus. Looking, too, at the Map, we find that Caus stands precisely where Domesday would incline us to search for Alretone; \u2014 in other words a line drawn from Min sterley to Alberbury will pass very near the domain of Caus. In short, Alretone, as it stands in Domesday , can only be represented by the Caus of the next century, and the Caus of the next century has no fitting antecedent in Domesday except Alretone. From an identification of places we pass to an identification of persons. The question is, who was that Roger, who, with five knights and other vassals under him, held the whole of the Domes day Manor of Alretone under the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury ? Clearly it was the same Roger who held the above-mentioned Manors of Minsterley and Alberbury, also under the Earl : clearly too that Roger was no other than Roger fitz Corbet, whose Ba ronial descendants, after the forfeiture of the Norman Earls, held the three Manors of Minsterley, Alberbury, and Caus immediately of the Crown. When we thus determine Roger fitz Corbet to have been Domesday Lord of Alretone postea Caus, every difficulty, whether about persons or places, subsides into perfect harmony. This careful settling of premises, tedious as it may seem, is never thrown away in antiquarian investigations. It often aids the judg ment or justifies the imagination in filling up some unchronicled period with a probability or a fact. This is its effect in the present instance. I am entitled, I think, to assume that, soon after Domesday, Roger fitz Corbet built a Castle at Alretone, and called it Caux. This was associating the place with the recollections of his own childhood, or at least with the antecedents of his House ; for he himself, or his father, came to Shropshire from the Pays de Caux in Normandy.4 The permanent fixture of a Norman name on an English locality is so very rare that I must needs mention 4 Blakeway' s Sheriffs of Shropshire, p. 38."], [21, "7 CAUS CASTLE. another instance, in many respects very similar to this of Caus. It was where the Norman Earl fixed his own name of Montgom ery on a Border Castle of his building.5 With regard to the name Alretone, and its synonym Auretone, a very singular, but, as I believe, a mere, coincidence wiU be apt to mislead the Shropshire Antiquary. Confining himself to observations drawn from his own province, he will see that a place caUed Auretone in Domesday has vanished, and ha3 never been known since Domesday under any other name than Richard's Castle.6 He also sees the Alretone of Domesday con verted into Caus Castle, and he naturaUy considers whether the name Auretone or Alretone does not involve some etymological aUusion to a Castle, existent o__projected. I beUeve that such an idea cannot be supported. Taking the whole range of Domesday, the name Alretone, or 'its synonyms, occurs about twenty times, and, so far as I have been able to trace the modern representatives of these Domesday places, I find that the connection between this name and a Castle is not only not constant but quite excep tional. In fact I beUeve that the connection is confined to the two instances of Caus and Richard's Castle. Escaping from a false theory, we find the etymology of A Iretone simple enough. Aire is the possessive case of the Saxon word Air, \u2014 an alder-tree, \u2014 sometimes writtten \u00c6h and Aler in the nominative. From this root come an infinity of names, such as AUer ton, Alderton, Alrewas, Alrewich, Alderley, EUerton, etc. To return to our main subject ; our history has at length brought us to the first of those Border Castles which, for two centuries after Domesday , served its continuous purposes of aggression or defence. From the Ruins of Caus Castle we obtain no evidence as to its date, and but a shadowy idea of the arrangement of its parts. The ma sonry which remains, massive though it be, is nothing but the rubble or filling-in of walls, whose facings have long since been removed. We trace the site of a massive Keep and the situation of an enor mous Well, \u2014 two prime necessities, the last perhaps less obvious than the first ; but in cases of sudden irruption of the Welsh, the inhabit ants of the district \u2014 men, women and children, were wont to seek refuge in these Castles. There are reasons for thinking that the very cattle were not excluded. Imagine a fortress, thus crowded, and in a state of siege, and what word of terror can have equalled that which sometimes announced the Castle- Well to be dry ? The site of Caus Castle seems to have been well selected for its object. The inherent strength of the position, the large building area, the wide command of prospect, especially of that important 5 Two other possible cases of such a change I have before alluded to (Vol. I. p. 129, note 5). Malpas, in Cheshire, is perhaps a fifth. The Welsh, I should ob serve, called the Town of Montgomery Tre-Valdwin. This was from Baldwin de Boilers (who lived in the time of Henry I. and was Lord of Montgomery), not, as Mr. Blakeway suggests (Hist. Shrewsbury, Vol. I. p. 41), from any Bald win of the family of Hodnet. 6 Supra, Vol. V. p. 225-6."], [22, "8 CAUS CASTLE. pass which we may call the Valley of The Rea, \u2014 these are features which tell of dangers and designs too manifold for the page of his tory, and too complex for the tongue of tradition. Exposed to all the turmoil of a hostile frontier, here dwelt the eldest of the two English sons of Corbet the Norman. On the right hand were the mountain fastnesses of Powis-land, on three other sides Roger fitz Corbet's position was immediately or remotely backed by the Strong holds and the Manors of his own English Vassals, or of his Brother the Lord of Longden. Further off in front, looking over Minster ley aud Worthen and across the Valley of the Rea, the eye rested on the Forest of the Stiperstones, once a Chase of Saxon Kings, but appropriated, with all its rights as a Royal Forest, by the Barons of Cans. To trace the descent of this Barony shall now be my object, and if I do so with unusual caution and minuteness, making the most of every available document, it is for this reason, viz. because the documents hitherto brought to bear upon the subject have been fewer than they might have been, and have been used to establish conclusions which further search shows to be fallacious. Roger fitz Corbet, for an account of whose parentage and brethren I am content to refer elsewhere,7 was probably a young man at the time of Domesday , seeing that he was living at least thirty-five years after the date of that Survey. A Legend, not indeed very authoritative, has named his Father, Corbet, as one of the Lords who was consulted by William the Conqueror as to the de fence of the Welsh Marches.8 If so, Corbet was probably living in 1080-1, when King William's personal attention was first directed towards Wales, and consequently Roger fitz Corbet cannot have been more than five years in possession at the time oi Domesday. However, I hold it to be much more likely that the Norman Earl of Shrews bury organized the frontier defences of Shropshire, than the King of England. That the Earl was ably seconded by Corbet and by Ralph de Mortimer, is more than probable. Ordericus gives the names of certain faithful and very valiant men whom Earl Roger employed in the government of his province. Corbat and his sons, Roger and Rodbert, are named by the Historian, I presume, in the order of seniority. Corbet's English possessions had been ap parently divided before Domesday between these two sons. The far more extensive fief of Roger is another proof of his seniority. A Charter of Earl Roger to Shrewsbury Abbey, which must have 7 Sheriffs of Shropshire, pp. 38, 39. | 3 LelanSs Collectanea, I. 230."], [23, "9 BARONY OF CORBET. passed between 1083 and 1086, and so before Domesday, is attested by Roger Corbeth.9 Again, in the very year of the Domesday re turn, Roger Corbet attests the Earl's Foundation-Charter of Ouat ford Church.10 After Domesday we have Roger, son of Corbet, attesting another Deed of the Earl's,11 and the Earl's general Char ter to Shrewsbury Abbey, passing between 1086 and 1094, is wit nessed both by Roger Chorbet and Robert Chorbet. Earl Roger is said to have died on July 27, 1094 ; but probably 1093 was the actual year of his decease. We are told, in a very credible manner, that \" when the Earl was dead, and when his body was being consigned to the grave in the Church of St. Peter (Shrewsbury Abbey), Roger fitz Corbeth gave to the Monks the Church of Wentnor (printed Nutenora), with the tithe of the same Vill and the tithe of Yockleton (printed Jochehulla) .\"13 Earl Hugh, succeeding in 1093-4, and slain in 1098, seems to have been at tended in most of his public acts by Roger fitz Corbet. One Char ter of that Earl, attested by Roger Corbet, has already been ques tioned as spurious.13 It is not the less suspicious, in that it assures the tithes of Lokelthulla (Yockleton) to Shrewsbury Abbey, as if the Earl himself had given them. A less suspicious Charter of Earl Hugh, also tested by Roger Corbet, records how the Monks had, by gift of the said Roger, \"the Church of Wontenoure and two parts of the tithes of the demesne of Ihokethul.\"14 A third, and undoubtedly genuine, Charter of Earl Hugh has the attestations of \" Roger Corbeth and Rotbert his brother.\"15 The next that we hear of Roger Corbet is his adherence, in 1102, to the treason of Earl Robert de Belesme, his defence of Brug Castle, and his ultimate surrender thereof to Henry I. Whether he suf fered in estate for his rebellion, more than he by his timely discretion, is a question, \u2014 a question which can only be settled by summing up those manorial details on which 1 have as yet hardly entered. Roger Corbet and his brother Robert appear in company and concert with the Viceroy Belmeis, both before and after the con secration of the latter to the See of London (July 26, 1208) . King Henry I.'s Confirmation to Shrewsbury Abbey passed undoubtedly in May 1121. The two Corbets attested it with all formality. Ego Rogerius filius Corbet subscripsi.

This Charter also recites Roger Corbet's grants of the Church and tithes of Wantenouura and the tithe of Joclehulle. Between this time (1121) and 1136 Roger Corbet gave to the Abbey of St. Peter the Vill of Wineslega (Winsley). His Charter is preserved, and is tested in a manner quite consistent with its presumed antiquity, viz. by Robert Corbet, Reinald de Hene wode (Han wood), Osegot de Winesleg, William Furmage, Woret, Eduinus Stabularius, Beccho Faber, Ordricus Sacrimarius.16 I have already adverted to a statement that in 1134 Caus Castle, being in the hands of Pagan fitz John (then Sheriff of Shropshire), was taken and burnt by the Welsh.17 1 cannot imagine any cotem porary forfeiture or escheat of the House of Corbet to tally with this stoiy. The unscrupulous mode in which Pagan fitz John is said to have exercised his provincial power is all that I can suggest in explanation of his being thus seized of the Castle of a less powerful Baron. King Stephen's Charter, confirming, in 1136, Roger Corbet's grant of Wenelega to Shrewsbury Abbey, embodies a valuable piece of genealogical evidence, when it adds that Roger Corbet's act was with the concession of his sons William and Evrard.18 We conclude that William and Evrard were the two eldest sons of Roger Corbet, but that at the time of their concession the eventual inheritance was expected to be in Evrard, probably because William was unmarried or childless. Between 1136 and 1155 we have an indication that William Corbet was dead, and that Ebrard's prospective heir was his son, or his younger brother Simon. The fact of Ebrard's suc cession, and the doubt about Simon's relationship to Ebrard, arise in this way. \u2014 Henry II. , confirming to Shrewsbury Abbey in 1155, recites the following grants. \u2014 De dono Rogeri Corbeth ecclesiam de Wantenourd, et decimas ejusdem villce, et decimas de Jocheshulld, et Wineslegam. De dono Ebrardi et Symonis filii ejus unum ferndellum in WantenoverP But I think that Henry III.'s confirmation to Shrewsbury Abbey, though much later, embodies a truer reading of this passage. Instead of the words Be dono Ebrardi et Symonis filii ejus, etc., it has the words De dono Ebrardi et Simonis filiorum ejus, etc.20 I conclude that when Ebrard Corbet, between the years 1136 and 1155, granted aferdendel in Wentnor to Shrewsbury Abbey, he expected to be succeeded by his brother Simon.

's Monasticon, III. p. 519, a. 19 * M Salop Chartulary, Nos. 36, 37."], [25, "11 BARONY OF CORBET. sistency with that idea is the fact that when, in the same interval, Everard Corbeth granted Edestan to Haughmond Abbey he had the consent of Simon Corbeth.31 The non-statement of their rela tionship leaves it more probable that they were brothers, than that they were father and son. The next step in this genealogy brings us to a second \u2014 Roger Corbet and his younger brother Simon. These two were, I suppose, sons of Simon and grandsons of Roger Corbet (I.) . Un questionably Roger Corbet (II.) was Baron of Caus at the time of Henry II.'s accession to the throne. In the summer of 1155 we have seen him in attendance on that King during the siege of Brug.22 It was probably in the autumn of the same year that Roger Corbeth, being at Court at Winchester, attests a Charter of Henry II. to Shrewsbury Abbey.23 In 1159 a Donum was assessed in Shropshire to which Wilbam fitz Alan, then Sheriff, contributed 100 merks, while 38 merks was chargeable on the other Knights of the County. Roger Corbet's proportion of these 38 merks was 10 merks, which sum he was excused by Writ-Royal. In 1162 Roger Corbet was similarly excused a debt of 35s., that being his pro portion of the Danegeld then levied in Shropshire. Under the year 1165 the Chronicles inform us of great disturb ances in Wales, and one of them gives particulars of three distinct but abortive expeditions, undertaken by Henry II. in person, against North Wales.24 The Pipe-Rolls give incidental evidence that the year was by no means a peaceful one on the Border. The Sheriff of Worcestershire's account contains the following items. He had paid J19. Is. 8d. for 509 measures (summis) of corn, sent to Shrewsbury ; also, \u00a317. 9s. 6d. for stores carried from Worcester to the army ; also, \u00a314. 11s. 8d. in livery of the soldiers (servien lum) of Montgomery ; also, \u00a348. to William fitz Adeline (the King's Steward), towards livery of the King's knights at Shrewsbury; and lastly, _\u00a314. 11s. 8d. to the soldiers (servientibus) of Chaus. Caus Castle was therefore at this period garrisoned by the Crown ; and I think it probable that this was in consequence of the pre vious decease of Roger Corbet, and the minority of his heir. The said heir was his nephew, Robert, the son of his brother Simon. Robert Corbet's first appearance is in the year 1176, when 21 Harleian MSS. 3868, so. 11. 22 Vol. I. p. 250. mas the ChanceUor, Reginald, Earl of Cornwall, WUUam, Earl of Bristol, and Roger, Earl of Hereford. 23 Salop Chartulary, No. 43.

The fine was paid, by even instalments, in 1176 and 1177. On January 24, 1190, King Richard I., being at Westminster, expedited a Charter to Robert Corbet relating to the Stiperstones Forest, of which it would seem that Corbet had been deprived. By this Charter the King \" restored and confirmed to Robert Cor- bet the whole Forest of Tenefrestanes with its appurtenances, to hold to the same Robert and his heirs, as that which pertained to the Honour of his Barony. Wherefore the said Robert and his heirs were to have and to hold the aforesaid Forest, well, and peaceably, and honourably, as Roger, the paternal uncle (patruus) of the said Robert, had held it in the time of King Henry, the Grantor's father. The Charter was expedited by the hand of William, Bishop of Ely, the King's Chancellor, and was attested by H. Bishop of Durham, R. Bishop of London, H. Bishop of Coventry, Henry (read Herbert) Archdeacon of Canterbury, J. Archdeacon of Chichester, William fitz Aldeline, Bertram de Ver don, William Pipard, R. de Witfeld, Michael Belet, William fitz Alan, Hugh Pantulf, John de Strange, Vivian de Roshall, and He lias de Etingeham.25 King Richard was at this time preparing for the Crusade ; and it has been stated on the authority of an ancient Roll, that Robert, son of Robert Corbet of Caus, was with the King at the siege of Acre.26 The account, which I quote, further represents this second Robert Corbet as succeeding to the Barony of Caus.26 This is a complex error. There was only one Robert Corbet of Caus, and his \u00e6ra was from 1176 to 1222. He had, it is true, a younger son Robert, but that son cannot have been old enough to have shared in the siege of Acre in the summer of 1191 ; for his elder brother, Thomas, lived till 1274. Nor yet can we entertain the 25 Transcript, communicated by Mr. George Morris of Shrewsbury. the first John fitz Alan, if born, was a mere infant. The Arms assigned to him are those of Albini, Earl of Arundel (ex cept that Albini's Licjn was armed and langued azure, instead of Gules, the lat ter being in fact an heraldic impossibUity) . But John fitz Alan can have had no pre tension to the Albini Arms tiU at least twenty-four years after the Siege of Acre, and probably never at aU ; for he was dead before the coheirship of Albini was recognized or had arisen. 26 Sheriffs of Shropshire, pp. 40, 36.

A Lord Marcher was little likely to be come a Crusader, and I have given evidence already to show that in November 1192 (that is, long before King Richard's return) Robert Corbet of Caus was no further from home than at Buildwas Abbey in Shropshire. The Pipe-Roll of 1193 corroborates this testimony; for in that year the Sheriff of Shropshire had paid Robert Corbet twenty merks wherewith to support himself iu the King's service. In the next year (1194) the Scutage for King Richard's redemp tion was levied in Shropshire. Robert Corbet was charged, and had paid \u00a34., for his quota iu that County. He was further charged \u00a31. for scutage of a knight's-fee in some County unspecified. This he had not paid, and it seems doubtful whether it was ever liquidated. As I have entered on the subject of scutages, I will proceed to give account of all that were assessed on the Barony of Robert Corbet. He was charged \u00a35. on his Shropshire fees to each of the two Scutages of Normandy, as assessed in 1195 and 1197 ; but \u00a31 . was left in arrear in each case, and not paid till 1201. It was probably for a Fee not iu Shropshire, though the Record does not mark the distinction. To the first scutage of King John assessed in 1199, at the rate of two merks per fee, Robert Corbet paid eight merks on his Shropshire fees, but left a fifth fee subject to a charge of two merks. To the second scutage of King John, assessed at two merks per fee in 1201, Robert Corbet paid ten merks at once. To the third scutage, similarly assessed in 1202, he paid nine merks down, and owed one merk. To the fourth scutage, assessed in 1203, he paid ten merks on five fees. To the fifth scutage, that of 1204, he was not assessed at all. In 1205 he was assessed ten merks to King John's sixth scutage. Of the seventh scutage, that of 1206, he was quit under a Writ Royal. To the scutage of Poitou, as sessed in 1214 at the rate of \u00a32. per fee, Robert Corbet paid \u00a310. In October 1217 Robert Corbet had letters directed to the Sheriff of Shropshire, entitling him to levy his own scutage.26 Nevertheless in the Pipe-Roll of 1218 he stands assessed ten merks on five fees to the first scutage of Henry III. To the scutage of Biham, assessed in 1221 at the rate of 10s. per fee, he paid \u00a31. Is. 7d. down, and owed \u00a31. 8s. 5c.. On the whole, we may safely assume that Robert Corbet's Barony was reputed, as far as scutages and military services were concerned,"], [28, "14 CAUS CASTLE. to be a Barony of five Knights'-fees. A Feodary which belongs to the year 1211 registers this fact in the following terms, \u2014 Robertus Corbet, Baro, tenet in capite, et debet servicium v militum?1 But with regard to one of these five fees we have seen a probability that it was not always acknowledged to be liable to scutage, and that it was not in Shropshire. At the cost of a lengthy digression I must give some account of this fee, for its history involves a point in the genealogy of Corbet. \u2014 The Middlesex Domesday gives an account of Daltega, a Manor of three hides in Helethorne Hundred, held by one Alnod, under Earl Roger de Montgomery.23 The place aUuded to is Dawley, in the Parish of Hayes, the Hundred of Elthorne, and the County of Middlesex. On the forfeiture of Earl Roger's famUy, Dawley was annexed to the Honour of WaUingford, which Honour, from the faUure of heirs, was in 1165 an Escheat, and in the hands of Henry II. At that date we find WUliam Corbet enroUed as Tenant of a Knight's-fee in the said Honour -f3 and I cannot doubt that the fee in question was Dawley. Whether WiUiam Corbet thus mentioned was a brother of the second Roger Corbet of Caus, I cannot say. It is only clear that Robert Corbet of Caus was the heir of both Roger and WUliam. In October 1198 we 'find Robert Corbet suing WUUam de Cramfield (_. e. Cranford) for 36 acres in Dalling, which Corbet claimed as appurtenant to the Barony which he held of the King in capite. This Plea is entered under the heading Villata de Oxebrug', showing that Dawley, near Uxbridge, was the place aUuded to. All I shaU say further of this suit is that it was still pending in October 1199, and that WUUam fitz Rannulf, who appears as Robert Corbet's Attorney throughout, was his Feoffee at Dawley.30 A RoU of the year 1201, recording a fine of five merks proffered by WiUiam fitz Rannulf to King John, adds that the said WUUam \" holds a knight's-fee which Robert Corbet holds of the Honour of WaUngford.\"31 A List of the King's Tenants in the Honour of .WaUingford, drawn up in John's reign, registers Robert Corbet as holding one knight's fee in DaUeg'he ; 32 WUliam fitz Rannulf was stUl Tenant thereof, though his name is not mentioned. In 1235-6 we find, under Middlesex, that the Auxilium, levied on marriage of the King's Sister, was assessed at 2 merks on MatUda de Albo Monasterio as Tenant of a knight's-fee in the Honour of Walingeford ; and a nearly cotemporary Record caUs the Lady, MatUda de Blancmustr', and places her fee in Daldeye.33 In 1253 the Honour of Wallingford, or a great part thereof, was of the appanage of Richard, Earl of Cornwall, better known as King of the Romans. The Earl was re quiring that the services due on Dalling should be discharged by Wilham de Albo- Monasterio ; but the latter, in Trinity Term of that year, sued Thomas Corbet, to acquit him, as against the Earl ; that is, the Tenant asserted the Mesne-Lord to be immediately liable to the Earl. Corbet did not appear. His Sureties, Richard lc Mey of Stretton (Stoney Stretton), and Osbert de Yokylton, were judged by the Court to be insufficient, and better Sureties were ordered to be found for the Defendant's appear ance on November 2nd.34 In March 1316 we find Gilbert de Barentyne entered as Lord of Dalley, in Mid- 27 Testa de Nevill, p. 55. 28 Domesday, so. 129, a, 1. 29 \u00a3iie\u00bb- Afyer, I. 186. 30 i?oi.

I now return to say what remains of Robert Corbet of Caus. \u2014 In 1195 we find Richard fitz Robert giving the King 3\u00a3 merks, that he may have right (pro habendo recto) against Robert Corbet concerning 7 merks. In 1196 the Sheriff of Shropshire pays Robert Corbet 10 merks. It was a present from King Richard \" to support Corbet in the King's service in the parts of Wales.\" In 1198 the Sheriff again pays Robert Corbet 10 merks towards the fortifications of Caus Castle (ad firmandum castrum suum de Chaus). On April 10, 1200, King John, then at Worcester, expedited a Charter, whereby Robert Corbet and his heirs were entitled to hold a weekly market on Wednesdays at Caos.36 A Letter of King John's, dated August 10, 1204, informs Wenunwin de Kevelloc (Prince of Powis) that the King has appointed Hugh Pantulf and Robert Corbet to ensure a safe-conduct to Wenunwin, if he comes to a Court shortly to be held at Woodstock.37 There was in this arrangement a special propriety, which we as certain from other Records. Wenunwin's wife was Robert Corbet's daughter, and Hugh Pantulf was probably the Lady's maternal relative. William fitz Alan, Robert Corbet, and Hugh Pantulf were witnesses to a convention dated at Shrewsbury on October 7, 1208, between King John and Wenhunwin. The object of this treaty was to secure the fidelity of the Welsh Prince by a number of hos tages. One of the said hostages is called Eyneon, son of Hedewin Flam.38 There is extant on the Patent-Rolls a letter of Robert Corbet to King John. It probably was written in January 1209. Bidding the King greeting and fealty, Corbet certifies his High ness that he undertakes that Hemon, son of Hedenawein, shall well and faithfully serve his Lord Wenhunwin and the King; also, that Howel, who was apparently to be exchanged as a hostage for Hemon, was the said Hemon's legitimate son ; and that for greater security Corbet had another of Hemon's sons in keeping at Caus. Corbet therefore entreats that Hemon may be given up to him, and that the King will send a written order for such delivery to Peter fitz Herbert, and will so act in the matter as that Corbet should not have to trouble the King again on Hemon's account.39 35 Parliamentary Writs, IV. 327. 36 Cart.

Robert, his Huntsman, and Robert, his son, had taken a stag near Stratton (Church Stretton). Up came Codigan, a servant of Robert Corbet, and to him the hunters gave a haunch (quissam) and a side (costam), to take to Ruitheton, whither it would seem Robert Corbet Senior was going. The other haunch the hunters had given to Codiwellan (probably ano ther of Corbet's servants), when Ralph, Under-Forester to Walter de Muneton, came upon the party. Young Robert Corbet fled, carrying with him the head and fore-quarter (fur cum) of the veni son. The Forester, Ralph, arrested the Huntsman, Robert, and seized two of his hounds, as well as the horns and a side of the stag, all which he delivered up to Hugh fitz Robert (then Chief- Forester of Shropshire). The said Hugh, under writ of H. de Nevill (Justice of the Forest), transferred the whole to the custody of certain Keepers or Sureties till such time as Pleas of the Forest should be held. It now appeared that these Keepers produced neither the Huntsman, the dogs, nor the venison before the Justices. They were Robert Corbet (senior, I presume), Roger Purcell, Ro bert de Hanewode, Hugh de Mersse, Robert de Hope, Ralph de Le (perhaps Ree), Wido de Arundell, Roger Sprenghose, Wido de Mersse, Robert de Langeford, Robert fitz Maddoc, Reiner de Acton, and Richard de Witon. The Justices seem to have de ferred to an excuse of these Sureties, viz. that they all, except Robert Corbet, had fined 60 merks before the trial, that they might be quit of this Suretyship. As to Robert Corbet, senior, he pleaded that the King had excused him this suit (loquelam) , and he called the King to warranty. So, because he was one of the King's Barons, and because he called the King to warranty, the Justices gave him a day (Tuesday in four weeks after Easter) to appear before the King, and bring Robert, his Huntsman, with him. As to Roger (read Robert), his son, who fled with the head and fore-quarter of the stag, Robert Corbet said that he was with the Earl of Chester, but where, he knew not. He promised however to send him word to come home (ad Curiam), and, if he so came, he (Corbet, senior) would forthwith undertake to produce him for trial (in posterum ipsum in manu capiet habendi recto) .40 On May 22, 1209, a King's messenger is despatched from South ampton to Robert Corbet.1*1 On June 25, 1209, we have an indi cation that Robert was in attendance on the King's Court at 411 Forest Rolls, Salop, No. II. m. 1. | 41 Rot.

Tbe King entrusted him with 20 merks, a present which he was to convey to Woenwnoen Walensis, as the Prince of Powis is called.*2 On November 13, 1213, King John, being at Wood stock, orders the Sheriff of Shropshire to respite a debt of 100s., due from Robert Corbet.43 The money, it seems, was a pr\u00e6stitum or loan previously made by the King during some Welsh expedi tion. On August 18, 1214, King John, being at Angouleme, deputes John le Strange and Robert Corbet as the Royal Com missioners to swear to a truce, which the King had recently negotiated with Lewellyn, Wenunwen, Maelgon, Madoc ap Griffin, and other Welshmen.44, We have sure proof of Robert Corbet's continued allegiance to King John in the fact of his obtaining Letters of Scutage from Henry III. in October 1217. His eldest son, Thomas, had however taken a different course, and the Castle of the loyal father had been seized by the Crown as a precaution against the malpractices of the son. However a Patent of Henry III., dated November 13, 1217, informs the Earl of Chester that Thomas Corbet had returned to his fealty, and had done homage to the King. Wherefore the Earl was to restore to Robert Cor bet his Castle of Caos, and all other lands whereof he had been disseized by reason of his son's rebellion. On July 22, 1219, Robert Corbet, Vivian de Rossall, and Warner de Wililey are appointed Justices to inquire concerning Forest-Assarts in Shropshire. On August 2, 1220, Margaret Corbet names Nicholas Walsh as her Attorney in a plea of land which she' had against Lewellyn.45 This Margaret I take to have been Robert Corbet's daughter, now the widow of Wenhunwen, Prince of Powis. On October 17, 1222, Robert Corbet was dead; Thomas, his son and heir, had fined \u00a3100. for his Relief, and had done homage to the King. The Sheriff of Shropshire was certified accordingly.46 Before I proceed with any account of Thomas Corbet, I must say something of a series of Charters which Robert Corbet expedited to the Monasteries of Buildwas and Shrewsbury. \u2014 1 . The earliest of these is his grant of Wentnor Mill to Buildwas. It is expressed to be with the counsel and assent of his wife, and of his heir. The Mill and Suit thereof, a Vivary, messuage, and gar den are conveyed in fee ; and a rent of 12d. is reserved to the Grantor. The Charter is attested by William fitz Alan; Hugh Pantulfe ; William fitz Rannulf (of whom we were lately speaking) ; \"2 Mot. Mis\u0153, p. 116. 43 \u2022 ** Rot. Fin. p. 504. Patent, p. 120.

There cannot be a doubt that the year 1198 is proximately the date of this Charter.48 2. Robert Corbet granted all Ritton in frank almoign to Buildwas. The territorial details of the grant belong to a future Chapter of our history. The witnesses were, \u2014 Thomas, the Grantor's son, William Corbet ; William fitz Odo ; Henry and Garin, Chaplains ; Guido de Arundel ; Roger Purcel; Henry Hager; and Robert de Hanewood.49 The year 1203 may be named as the proximate date of this Deed. 3. Next in this series comes a Charter whereby Robert Corbet, for himself and his heirs, quit-claims to Shrewsbury Abbey the Ad vowson of Wentnor, which Roger Corbet, his predecessor, had given to the Abbey, as the Charter of King Henry did testify. He con firms also two-thirds of the tithes, great and small, of his demesne of Jokethull, which tithes the Abbey had possessed from ancient times.

Robert Corbet's grant of Hulemore to Buildwas Abbey in volves some territorial particulars which I need not state here. It was a grant in frank almoign, for the love of God, for the health of the Grantor's soul and of all his progeny, and was made with the counsel of his wife and his heir. It was attested by Thomas Corbet (the heir in question); Baldwyn de Hodenet; William Burnel; Wydo de Harundele ; Roger de Hastim; Thomas Hager; John de Hondreslowe; Roger Burnel; Simon de Witton; Richard de Linleg; and Robert de Hanewde.50 This Deed probably passed between 1210 and 1220. 5.

His Son Thomas's in speximus and confirmation thereof, which probably passed imme diately on his succession, is attested by seven witnesses, six of whom had attested his father's charter. The seventh was Richard Corbet.53 Thomas Corbet was probably not far short of forty years of age when he succeeded his father. His presumed assent in 1198 to his Father's grant of Wentnor Mill implies nothing as to his age, though I think he was then about fourteen. A Writ of King John, dated October 15, 1207, indicates that Thomas Corbet had been serving in Poitou, in lieu of James de Newmarch, out of whose chattels Corbet was entitled to a sum of 20 merks.53 On September 16, 1212, Thomas Corbet appears in the retinue of King John at Geddington (Northamptonshire), and has a present of one merk from the King.54 On May 9, 1213, he participated iu a Donum, made at Canterbury, to the Knights attendant on the King. His share was 3 merks, as were the shares of Baldwin de Hodenet and William Pantulf.55 His subsequent defection from King John, his reconcdiation to Henry III., and his succession as son and heir of Robert Corbet in October 1222, have been already stated. Thomas Corbet ought to have paid \u00a350. of his relief at Easter 1223, but a Writ-Close of March 10, abates the payment by \u00a320., which the King presented to Cor bet in aid of the fortifications at his Castle of Caors.56 I will now give account of the various scutages and aids assessed on Thomas Corbet's Barony during his tenure thereof. In 1224 he had acquittance by Writ-Royal of the scutages of Montgomery and Bedford. In 1225 he owed the King \u00a31. for the balance of the scutage of Byham, left unpaid by his Father, and \u00a380. the balance of his own Relief. In 1229 he was assessed 10 merks on 5 fees for the scutage of Keri, but had a Writ of acquittance. In 1230 he was excused the scutage of Brittany, but in 1231 was assessed \u00a310. on five fees, to that of Poitou. He was excused the scutage of Elvin in 1232. In 1235-6 he was assessed at the rate of 2 merks per fee, on nine fees, to the Aid in marriage of the King's Sister. He paid the charge by the hand of Richard his Clerk.57 It would seem therefore that the fees on which he owed military service were fewer 54 \u2022 55 Rot. Mis\u0153, 14 John, mm. 4, 12. 56 Claus.

He was ac quitted of the scutage of Gannok in 1246. In 1254 he was assessed \u00a310. on 5 fees to the Aid for knighting Prince Edward, but was acquitted of the scutage of Wales in 1260. I return to give other particulars of the career of Thomas Corbet. A Writ-Close, dated at Montgomery, on October 1, 1224, shows his love of the Chase. The Chief Forester of Shropshire is to allow him to pursue any three boars through the Forests of Shropshire, which he might happen to unkennel in his own Forest.59 Another Writ-Close of May 19, 1226, orders Godescall de MagheUns (then Custos of Montgomery) to acquit Thomas Corbet of all obligation to do suit to the Hundred of Montgomery, if it appeared on Inqui sition that Robert Corbet, his father, had been quit of such suit in the reigns of Henry IL, Richard I., and John.60 On August 27, 1226, Lewellyn, Prince of Wales, met King Henry III. at Shrews bury, and undertook to satisfy Hugh de Mortimer, Thomas Corbet, Fulk fitz Warin, and other Barons Marchers, in respect of certain lands of theirs which he had seized. Lewellyn had appointed Sun day, October 25, to meet the said Barons at Oswestry, and King Henry III., by a Writ of September 2, names the Bishops of Here ford and Worcester, with Walter de Clifford, John de Monemue, John fitz Alan, John le Strange, and William de Cantilupe to at tend the meeting and report the result.61 At the very time when King Henry conferred with Lewellyn at Shrewsbury, he sat in the Curia Regis, presiding over the business of an ordinary Assize, as well as regulating other matters. Among the latter, the Sheriff of Shropshire was ordered to proceed person ally to the Forest of Stenufretames (Stiperstones), and there make Inquest as to whether the Forest of Stenufretames, and the Haye, and Gatesden, and Murthereleg, and Godwynescot, and the Park of Elrenor, were appurtenances of the Barony which Thomas Corbet 58 In or about 1240 we have (Testa de Nevill, pp. 45, 48) two distinct Feodaries of Thomas Corbet's Shropshire Barony.

The other list presents a total of 8f fees, but excludes both Acton Burnel and Welbatch, which are given as two half fees of the Honour of Pulverbatch. Acton BurneU was cer tainly, and Welbatch probably, a Corbet fee, so that on the whole the actual feoff ments in Corbet's Barony amounted to at least 9i fees. \u00bb Claus.l. 623. \u2022\u00bb \u2022 61 Claus.

The Jury which assembled on this occasion consisted of 25 persons, all probably of knightly degree, and including John le Strange, John fitz Alan, and William Pantulf. Their report, it is sufficient to observe, was fol lowed merely by an order for fuller inquiry.62 In October, 1227, Thomas de Muleton and his Fellow- Justices sat at Shrewsbury. The list of amercements and other charges authorized on this occasion contains the following consecutive en tries : \u2014 Heredes Roberti Corbet 3 sol. de catallis. Emma Corbet 2s. 6d. de catallis. Thomas Corbet Is. 4d. pro eodem. It would seem that Thomas Corbet and his Father had been remiss in ac counting to the Crown for the chattels of certain felons within their jurisdiction. The question whether Emma Corbet was Robert Cor bet's widow, I cannot determine on this or any other evidence. A Letter of Henry III. to Lewellyn, Prince of Aberfraw and Lord of Snowdon, bears date February 2, 1232. A year's truce, commencing November 30, 1231, was current; but Lewellyn had complained of the rupture thereof by Tliomas Corbet. The King promises full inquiry and amends, but intimates that only two of the persons, complained of as accomplices of Thomas Corbet, belonged to that Baron's jurisdiction. The others were apparently the King's own tenants, and the King promises special amends for the wrongs done by one Richard Suwerd.63 A Patent of June, 1233, shows King Henry dismissing from the custody of Philip de Colevile a hostage of Thomas Corbet's, viz. Reginald Corbet. The Pipe-Roll of the same year shows that any mistrust of Corbet's fidelity had been exchanged for confidence. The Sheriff of Shropshire, by the King's order, presents Thomas Corbet with a sum of 10 merks. Between the years 1234 and 1239, R. (Ralph de Maidstone), Bishop of Hereford, inspects and confirms the Charters of Sir Robert Corbet and his son Thomas, giving the tenth of the lead from Shelve Mine to Shrewsbury Abbey.

Abbot of Hagh mon, Robert de Gyros, and Robert de Wuteton.64 About the same time, I find Sir Thomas Corbet, followed by his brother Robert, in the testing-clause of a Haughmond Charter. On January 10, 1236, King Henry III. confirmed by Charter, to his faithful and beloved Thomas Corbet, the restoration and confir- 62 Assizes, 10 Hen. III., m. 4 dorso. 63 F\u0153dera, I. 202.

A Writ-Close of March 8, 1238, shows that the truce between King Henry and Lewellyn would ex pire on July 25 following, and that the King was much exasperated at hearing that Lewellyn had caused David bis son to receive the homage of the Magnates of North Wales and Powys. The King summons a Council to meet him at Oxford on Tuesday after the Quinzaine of Easter, and to advise on these matters. Among those summoned are John fitz Alan, William de Warren of Whitechurch, William fitz Warin, Thomas Corbet, Ralph de Mortimer, Walter de Clifford, and Fulk fitz Warin.66 The Pipe-Roll of the same year shows Thomas Corbet amerced 10 merks for some disseizin .- and in 1240 he is amerced 5 merks for forest-trespass. In 1242 he gives the King a fine of one palfrey, that he may have judgment in some cause. In 1243 he is amerced 20 merks for trespass. King Henry III., by a Writ dated January 2, 1246, orders In quest to be made as to certain of Thomas Corbet's Manors, \u2014 whether they were out of the limits of the King's Forest ; also, whether Corbet's Men, of the Welsh tongue, had been used to pay toll at Montgomery and Shrewsbury. A Jury of thirteen replied to these inquiries, that Worthin, Forton, Caus, Minsterley, Yoke thull, and Wentnor were extra forestam, except a part of Corbet's fee in Worthin, which was infra forestam. Also they said that Corbet's Tenants de lingua Walensi, after they became his tenants, had given toll at Montgomery and Shrewsbury. This return was not satisfactory. A second Writ, of May 7, 1246, complains that \" the Inquisition, concerning Warren to be granted to Thomas Corbet in Worthin, was insufficiently made,\" and directs a new Inquest. A second Jury of thirteen (three of them members of the former pannel) was assembled. These Jurors declared that Forton, Cauheis, Minsterley, Yokethul, and Worthin were extra metas forest\u0153, but that part of Wentnor was infra metas forestce, and that the residue of Wentnor adjoined the Forest.07 With these ex- 65 Rot.

V It is evident that the first Jury had I confused the Manors of Wentnor and"], [37, "23 BARONY OF CORBET. ceptions, the Jury knew of no other damage to the King's Forest, which could result from Corbet's proposed Charter of Free Warren. As to the question of Toll, this Jury stated that \" the men of Robert Corbet (Thomas's father) of the Welsh tongue were quit of toll at Salop and Montgomery before that the said Robert married his daughter to Wenhunwync ; but afterwards, through the strife and war which arose between them, the said men had paid toll till the present day.\"68 This Verdict seems to have determined the King to allow Thomas Corbet Free-warren in all his Manors, except Wentnor ; for a Char ter, dated at Clarendon, July 1, 1246, gives Thomas Corbet such a right in his demesnes of Caus, Worthin, Forton, Yokethill, and Minsterley.69 As to the question of Toll, a third Writ issued on July 9, 1246, to the Sheriff of Shropshire (then John le Strange). He was, in full Court of the County, and in presence of himself and the Keepers of the Pleas of the Crown, to empannel twelve Knights, who were to be related to himself neither in the way of affinity nor personal grudge ; and he was to take care to keep himself free of all suspicion in this business, as he wished to remain unharmed. The Knights were to say whether Thomas Corbet's men of the Welsh tongue, who owed fealty to the said Thomas, ought to be quit of toll in the Markets aforesaid, by ancient right, possessed by Corbet and his Ancestors, or by permission; and how long they had been so quit, and by whose permission. The twelve Knights (seven of whom had sat on one or other of the previous Juries) replied that the men of Thomas Corbet's ancestors had been so quit of toll by ancient right\u2122 A Charter of Feb. 27, 1248, entitles Thomas Corbet to hold a yearly Fair at his Manor of Kaus on the vigil, the day, and the morrow of the Translation of St. Thomas the Martyr (July 7). The appointment of Thomas Corbet (a Baron Marcher) to be Sheriff of Shropshire and Staffordshire in this same year (1248) is an extraordinary one, and Worthin, saying that of each which was true only of the other.

When we find that Thomas Corbet of Hadley was deceased in August 1247, we are satisfied that it was the Baron of Caus, whom a Patent of May 18, 1248, entrusts with the Custody of the two Counties, and to whom John le Strange is ordered to give up the Castles of Shrewsbury, Brug, and Ellesmere by a further Patent of June 22, 1248. Thomas Corbet accounted as Sheriff for the half-year ending Michaelmas 1248, the year ending Michaelmas 1249, and the half-year ending Easter 1250.71 He quitted office deeply indebted to the Crown. The Pipe-Roll of 1251 charges no less a sum than \u00a3256. 10s. 4d. as the arrears of Thomas Corbet. In 1250-1, Thomas Corbet came before the Barons of the Ex chequer and made a recognition or statement, which not only shows what great immunities were claimed by the Barons of Caus, but supplies a test whereby we may estimate the accuracy of that genea logical table which I shall give of their descent. Corbet stated that he had had five antecessors since the Conquest of England, and that none of them had rendered any relief to the King or to his antecessors for those five knights'-fees which he (Corbet) now held of the King in capite.72 If we turn to the subsequent table, it will be seen that, including Corbet the Norman, exactly five generations of this House had passed away before Thomas Corbet's accession. If, on the other hand, we assume that Thomas Corbet could not have intended to enumerate Corbet the Norman among those antecessors whose Relief was a question, it is still possible that he may have counted two of the first Roger Corbet's three sons as antecessors ; for, if two of those sons had enjoyed the Barony, the term antecessor was technically applicable to each, even though one left no issue. As to Corbet's statement about Relief, he himself was certainly the first recorded Lord of Caus who had paid the Baronial Fine of \u00a3100. In 1251, Roger de Somery and Robert de Grendon are instructed by Patent to inquire into a complaint made by Thomas Corbet against Hugh de Say and another. It concerned the rescue of some stolen booty, taken on Corbet's land,, and the slaying one of his 71 Sir Thomas Corbet stands first wit ness to a Deed (No. 385) in the Salop Chartulary, dated October 18, 1248.

A Patent of 1252 appoints Alan la Zouche, Justice of Chester, to inquire concerning certain wrongs committed against the King and his subjects, in the Marches of Salop and Staffordshire, by Thomas Corbet. In 1253, the Pipe-Roll charges Thomas Corbet with numerous arrears from the period of his Shrievalty, and also with 60 merks for an Aid of the current year, viz. for the King's transfretation into . Gascony. This Aid was very irregularly assessed, but Corbet's liability seems penal, rather than proportional to any service he might owe. At the Inquest of 1255, the Jurors of Chirbury Hundred com plained of several diminutions of the King's prerogative, effected by Thomas Corbet in respect of his Manors in that quarter. He had withdrawn certain Pleas of the said Hundred to his Court of Caus, though the Manor of Caus was not within the said Hun dred, nor owed any suit thereto. This withdrawal of Pleas of felony, bloodshed, theft, and hue and cry, from Thomas Corbet's Chirbury Fief, had for five years involved an annual loss of 8s. to the Crown.73 The Jurors of Ford Hundred presented that Sir Thomas Trebec (read Corbet) held the/ee of Caus of the King in capite, by service of 5 \\ knights in time of war, and that he did suit to both County and Hundred.74 On May 9, 1255, Justices are appointed to try an action of novel disseizin, preferred by Thomas Corbet against Griffin ap Wenunwin for a tenement in Caus. On July 5, 1255, another Patent appoints three Justices to set to rights the wrongs and strifes which subsisted between these same persons, whom we know to have been uncle and nephew. On October 26, 1255, John le Strange, junior (as was afterwards alleged by Thomas Corbet), came upon Corbet's Manors of Worthen, Brocton, Wentnor, Aston, Hanton, Bechesfeld, and Bromlawe, and took goods therefrom to the value of 700 merks.75 This matter does not concern Caus or its neighbourhood ; but I mention it here because it shows the position of two great Border families at the period. At the Assizes of 1256 a presentment was made by the full and the cumulative damages were rated at \u00a31000.

County-Court of Salop to the effect that the Vills of Cauz, Wal lop, and Feniton (Vennington) were within the County of Salop, but had never been used to make any appearance before the King's Justices. With respect to Caus this averment is fully established by the general, but of course negative, evidence of Records. The Pipe-Roll of 1259 shows Thomas Corbet chargeable with the fol lowing amercements, inflicted at the Assizes of 1256 or afterwards, viz. 20 merks for disseizin, 10 merks for many trespasses, 5 merks for many defaults, and 5 merks for non-production of some one for whom he was Surety. On July 29, 1259, Roger de Montalt and Gilbert Talbot are appointed to adjust and settle certain breaches of truce between Griffin ap Wenunwen and Thomas Corbet. On August 1, 1260, King Henry, exasperated by the lawlessness or patriotism of Lewellyn ap Griffyth, and hearing that the Welsh had stormed Builth Castle and slaughtered the English garrison, summoned the Army of Wales to muster at Shrewsbury on Sep tember 8. Among the vassals of the Crown to whom summonses were directed, the following were to appear, with horses and arms, and their complement of service due on such occasions. These were Roger de Somery, Walter de Clifford, Griffin ap Wenunwen, John Giffard, Henry de Hastings, Fulk fitz Warin, William de Braose, Roger de Mortimer, Giles de Clifford, John fitz Matthew, William Devereux, Walter de Dunstanvill, Reginald fitz Peter, John fitz Alan and Thomas Corbet. James d' Audley, Ralph Botiller, Simon Earl of Leicester, John fitz Philip, and John le Strange were to muster at Chester.76 This magnificent prelude ended in a truce, terminable on the 24th of June, 1262. Meantime I find Thomas Corbet encom passed with litigation, the details of which I shall reserve for more appropriate localities. I should bere notice however that in Octo ber 1260, Corbet names Robert le Blundel or William Hager as his Attorneys in his suit of trespass against John le Strange, junior. A Patent of March 30, 1261, gives Thomas Corbet an annual salary of 50 merks out of the Royal Treasury. On July 22, 1262, King Henry III., being then at Amiens, had received from Philip Basset (Justiciar of England) a report (it was a false one) of the death of Lewellyn ap Griffith. The King wrote at once to Basset, apprehensive that David, younger brother to Lewellyn, would set up a title to the sceptre of North Wales, though Owen, the elder brother of the three, was still living. It 76 F\u0153dera, I. 398, 420."], [41, "27 BARONY OF CORBET. is obvious that the King intended to allow no claim to the Princi pality, but to seize it for himself. If the report turned out to be true, Basset was to summon the King's army to Shrewsbury, and to forward letters (enclosed), which the King had providently written to Roger de Mortimer, Reginald fitz Peter, John le Strange (senior), John fitz Alan, Thomas Corbet, Griffin ap Wenunwen, Fulk fitz Warin, Ralph le Botyller, and James d' Audley.77 King Henry relanded in England on December 20, 1262, and found Lewellyn, not only living, but in active rebellion. The Spring of 1263 is noticeable for Prince Edward's campaign on the Border. His partial success against Lewellyn was unattended by any great results. The intrigues of Montfort and his party served to withdraw the Prince from Wales to London, and a want of una nimity among the Baron's Marchers, whom he left behind, was probably the foundation of some of the misfortunes which were now awaiting the Royal cause. At this critical juncture, viz. in Trinity Term 1263, I find Thomas Corbet, for instance, intent on a private quarrel. He was suing John le Strange, senior, in the Courts of Westminster, for hunting and taking beasts in his (Cor bet's) Warren of Pecton. Le Strange had already failed to appear to the charge on several occasions, and the case was adjourned. A Patent of June 1263 gives protection from all suits, etc., to Thomas Corbet and many of his retainers ; such protection to extend to November 1st, or for so much of the interval as the Welsh war should last. The persons named in this Patent are Peter Corbet (eldest son, I presume, of Thomas), Robert Corbet (of Wattles borough), Robert Blunde, Roger de Merse, Stephen de Boulers, William Hager, William de Horton, John de Hanewod, Roger Gudmund, Robert Pycot, William Bagot, Robert de Wytton, Ro bert Burnel, Hugh Hacher (Hager), Richard de Hope, Adam de Brerlawe, Roger fitz Baldwin, Alan Corbet, and John de Cotes. A small detail of Border history is curiously supplied in the attes tation of a grant by Robert Pigot, son of William Pygot, to Alber bury Priory. It is attested by Robert Corbet, as yet not a knight, Roger de Merse, Roger fitz Matthew Clerk, Thomas Hord, and others, and is dated (substantively) on February 2, 1264, Henry son of King John, reigning, and Llewelin sonof Griffin, then being with Griffin son of Wenhunwen, with no small army, to devastate the March and especially (to destroy) Roger de Mortimer.18 So then the Prince of Powis was already detached from the EngHsh alliance. '<\" F\u0153dera, I. 398, 420. ] :s Hist. Shreivsbury, 1. 125, note 4. 4t"], [42, "28 CAUS CASTLE. But I must return to Thomas Corbet. There is no evidence that he ever swerved from his loyalty. Yet in the interval between the battle of Lewes (May 14, 1264) and the battle of Evesham (August 4, 1265), I do not find his name once mentioned in those Pseudo patents whereby Montfort endeavoured to get rid of Roger de Mor timer, Hamo le Strange, James d'Audley, and the more zealous Loyalists of the Marches.79 The cause of Corbet's apparent inac tivity can only be conjectured. The infirmities or the caution of old-age may have prevented his co-operation with the more active members of a party, whose chief, Roger de Mortimer, had hardly reached the prime of manhood;80 or perhaps there was that in Thomas Corbet's temper and character which would have isolated him from any party, even if that party had not included his personal enemies, the Stranges. We certainly know that many of Thomas Corbet's Tenants espoused the cause of Montfort. A Patent of King Henry III., dated at Kenilworth, on Septem ber 20, 1266, certifies that \" our faithful and beloved Thomas Cor bet at our instance has restored to our faithful and beloved Robert Corbet certain lands in Addeston which he (Thomas) had seized on the ground of the late disturbances, and has remitted his rancour against the said Robert.\" Among Pleas classified as cor am Rege in February, 1267, we have the following : \u2014 \" Thomas Corbet presents himself against Odo de Hodnet, Robert Corbet, Robert Pycot, Roger de Mersche, Thomas Hord, John de Arundel, and Richard Pech, as to why, under occa sion of the late disturbance of the realm, they seized his (Thomas's) goods at Caus, Jokelhull, Munsterle, Worthin, Schelve, and Aston.\" The Defendants (who were Thomas Corbet's own Tenants) did not appear, and had already made several similar defaults; but the Sheriff sent word that they were now at St. Edmundbury, coram Rege, with horses and arms. This was however proved to be false, and they were summoned for a day in three weeks of Easter.81 I do not find the result of this suit, but only several adjournments thereof. In Hilary Term, 1268, the King, at the instance of Hamo le Strange, sent word to the Justices then sitting, that \" he had par doned the Defendants for all their trespasses and would preserve 79 Supra, Vol. I. p. 284. 80 Supra, Vol. IV. p. 221. bury (Rot.

In Easter and Trinity Terms, 1268, Thomas Corbet was still prosecuting the Suit. Another of these protracted suits of Thomas Corbet's, originating in February, 1267, was against Peter Knotte, who had seized Cor bet's goods and beaten his men. Knotte, it appears, was a Chap lain, and Corbet's suit against him merged in a suit against the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, who in Trinity Term, 1268, was still neglecting his alleged obligation to further the ends of justice against the defaulting Clerk. A third suit of the same date was prosecuted by Thomas Corbet against Hameline de Bouley, a Devonshire man, who had plundered Corbet's goods at Selverton and Exeter. In this Suit the Bishop of Exeter was implicated. A fourth prosecution by Corbet was that of Ranulf Payn, a Clerk, who had plundered Corbet's goods at Shrewsbury, Moles, and Hor ton during the civil war. This suit, like that against Peter Knotte, involved the Bishop of Lichfield, and was pending in Michaelmas Term, 1267. We have seen Thomas Corbet at issue with his Vassals, his kins men, and his Compatriots of the Marches. We next find him in volved in a lawsuit with his own son. In the last week of August, 1267, before the King at Salop, Peter Corbet withdrew the suit of novel disseizin which he had against Thomas Corbet for a tenement in Caus and Acton. Peter now quit-claimed the premises to Thomas for a sum of 10 merks.82 On September, 12, 1267, Henry III., still at Shrewsbury, expe dited a Charter to the Abbey there. Among the witnesses was Thomas Corbet.83 On September 20, 1267, as was afterwards al leged, Walter, son of Philip de Mungomery, David de Sullan, Robert de Say, and Griffin Seys, plundered Thomas Corbet's goods at Wentnor. They were apparently set on by Adam de Mongo mery, and were of the party or faction (de societate) of Hamo le Strange. Corbet's prosecution of these persons I will give in due course. At Westminster, in October, 1267, Thomas Corbet was suing Adam Cox, Alan Gamell, Hugh Colle, Baldwin le Bulgere, Thomas le Messeure, Roger Pride, Henry Charite, Alan Tanghelard, John le 82 Placita, 51 Hen. III., m. 3 dorso. | M Salop Chartulary, No. 51."], [44, "30 CAUS CASTLE. Vileyn, and Ivo de Salop (all well-known burgesses of Shrewsbury), for the following trespasses : \u2014 Adam Cox had assaulted Madoc fitz Wymark, Corbet's Villain, and had taken from him a ring of Cor bet's. Alan Gamell and the others had, during the civil war, seized Corbet's goods at Shrewsbury, Moles (Meole), and Horton. More over John le Vileyn and Ivo de Salop, being at the time Bailiffs of Shrewsbury, had restored sundry goods of Corbet's to certain ene mies of the King, whom Corbet had pursued and found with the plunder in their hands. Corbet had apparently attached the goods and left them in the hands of Sureties or Trustees, from whom the Bailiffs had taken them, for the aforesaid purpose of handing them over to the Freebooters. In Hilary Term, 1268, I find Corbet asking leave of the Court to withdraw this prosecution. The Pipe-Roll of 1269 quotes a King's Writ excusing \u00a333. 9s. 4d. of the debts due from Thomas Corbet to the Crown. He still owed \u00a36. By Charter dated February 24, 1270, Thomas Corbet, styling himself \" Son of Robert Corbet,\" and \" Lord of Caures,\" gives, as if it were an original grant, the tenth of the lead produced in Schelve- Mine to Shrewsbury Abbey. The Charter was expedited in the Monks' Infirmary, and was attested by Brian de Bromtone, John Lingayne, Vivian de Roshall, John de Lee and Robert Blundel, Knights, also by John de Prestecpte, Adam le Bole, John de Arun dell, and William Hager, Clerk.84 At the Forest Assizes of November 1271, it was presented that \" Peter, son of Thomas Corbet, having roused a stag in his Father's Forest, had pursued it in the King's Forest.\" A Patent of February 10, 1272, presents Thomas Corbet with a sum of 40 merks, in return for good services and losses incurred. The money was to be provided out of the first issues of the Eyre of the King's Justices in Herefordshire. At Shrewsbury Assizes, in October 1272, Thomas Corbet prose cuted Walter son of Philip de Mongomery, and others, who, as aforesaid, had plundered his goods at Wentnor in September 1267. The Defendants pleaded that the King, by a Charter of March 8, 1268, had pardoned his faithful and beloved Hamo le Strange and all of his party (de familid sud) all trespasses, etc., which they had committed in contravention of the Statutes of Oxford, and in the time of civil war, down to the date of the said Charter. Also it was shown that the Defendants were de societate Hamonis Extranei, i. e. 84 Salop Chartulary, No. 289."], [45, "31 BARONY OF CORBET. of the following of the said Hamo. To this, Corbet very aptly re joined that on September 20, 1267, there was no war, and that the King's pardon only extended to the time of civil war (perturbacionis) . The parties were ordered to attend and receive judgment coram Rege in the Quinzaine of Hilary 1273,85 \u2014 a period, be it observed, which King Henry did not live to see. Thomas Corbet was now also approaching his end. In 1272 he seems to^have completed his foundation of the Chapel of St. Mar garet at Caus. His death probably took place in September or October 1274. On the 23rd of the latter month an Inquest, held at Yockleton, found that the Knights'-fees which constituted his Barony, were 8| in number, and that he owed thereon the service of 5 knights'-fees in time of war. His whole income was put at \u00a3101. 11s. 9d. per annum. In Caus itself he had had 4 caru cates in demesne. Twenty-eight burgages there paid a rent of Is. each. The garden was worth 6s. 8d. and the Dove-cot 5s. per annum. Peter his Son and heir would hold his estates of the King, as of the Escheat of a sometime Earl of Shrewsbury (Robert de Belesme).86 The wife of Thomas Corbet was Isabel, sister and, in her issue, rightful coheir of Reginald de VaUetort, of Trematon, Cornwall. His children by her were Peter, his successor, Alice, wife of that Robert Baron Stafford who died in 1282, and Emma, wife of that Brian de Brompton who died about 1287. Thomas Corbet's Will was proved at Hereford in 1275 by the aforesaid Sir Peter Corbet and Sir Bryan de Brompton.87 I have been careful to relate many minute particulars in the life of this remarkable, if not great, man, because that life covered a great portion of the \u00e6ra with which my history has to deal. Thomas Corbet's early childhood was probably coeval with the last few years of Henry II.'s reign. His Christian name, not a common one at the period, was perhaps suggested by a great character and catastrophe which then filled the minds of men. I mean the murder, or reputed martyrdom, of Thomas a Becket. As a boy and amid scenes of petty warfare on the Border, Thomas Corbet will have listened to spirit stirring tales of far distant lands, when all Christendom exulted in the Saracenic exploits of King Richard, or wept at the news of his captivity. The youth and manhood of Thomas Corbet were conver sant with the recklessness, treason, and terror which disfigured the 85 Assizes, 56 Hen. III., m. 8 dorso. 86 Inquisitions, 2 Edw. I., No. 42. ' w Sheriff's of Shropshire, pp. 40,41."], [46, "32 CAUS CASTLE. reign of John. His maturity and his old-age outmeasured the fifty six years during which the third Henry revelled in selfish imbe cility, precipitated an anarchy, or exulted in a restoration which reflected less credit on himself than on the meanest Royalist who adhered to his cause. On November 2, 1274, King Edward I. accepted the homage of\u2014 Peter Corbet, as heir of Thomas, lately deceased. The Escheator citra-Trent was ordered to take security from Brian de Brompton and the other Executors of Thomas Corbet's Will, as regarded his debts, and then to allow them to administer.88 The Pipe-Roll of 1274-5 leaves a blank space where the sum charged against Peter Corbet for his Relief ought to appear * but I learn from another source that he paid the sum usually charged on a Barony, viz. \u00a3100. From the same source I gather that the sum of 100 merks paid by Peter Corbet (II.) in 1300 was thus reduced, in reference to Edward I.'s Carta Magna de LibertatibusP But to return, \u2014 Peter Corbet, son and heir of Thomas, is thus mentioned in the Chirbury Hundred-Roll of November 1274. \u2014 \" Sir Peter Chorbet holds the Barony of Chaws of the King by service of five-knights. Lewellyn, Prince of Wales, in the time of the late war, demolished his Castle of Wythegruc, and occupied, and now detains from the said Peter, a third part of his Barony, to wit the whole land be tween Kelemet and Severn, to the damage of the said Peter, whereby the said Peter cannot fully discharge the service of hisBarony.\"90 This complaint did not relate to any part of the domain of Caus, but I mention it here to show the state of the Border at the time of Peter Corbet's succession. The Ford Hundred-Roll of the same date contains many particulars about Caus Barony and estate. The ser vice due thereon was that of five knights, when the King, in time of war, entered Wales ; and Peter Corbet's Predecessors were enfeoffed by Earl Roger for that service. However, the actual fees of the Barony were now stated as nine and a half. \u2014 The late Sir Thomas Corbet had arrogated rights of haut justice, such as having a gallows and imprisoning and releasing at his plea sure both felons and honest men. He would not allow the King's Coroners to enter the Liberty of Kawes. He had obtained rights of Warren from Henry IIL, but whether he had overstrained them 83 Rot. Finium, 2 Edw. I., in. 3. 89 Madox's Baronia Anglica, p. 129. 50 Rot. Hundred. II. 90."], [47, "33 BARONY OF CORBET. the Jury knew not. He had maintained afi'ee haye near Kawes, and the free haye of Lochton (now Loton Park) ; how long or by what authority the Jurors were ignorant.91 I next hear of Peter Corbet as summoned with Fulk fitz Warin, Reginald fitz Peter, and a host of Chieftains, to be at Worcester on July 1, 1277, prepared for King Edward's invasion Of Wales.92 Here upon Peter Corbet acknowledged the service of 5 fees to be due for the Barony of Kaus, and proposed to perform it by two Knights (himself and Sir Robert Corbet), and by six Servientes, viz. Thomas de Radeburgh, Roger de Eyton, Adam Haghe (Hager), Richard de Hop, Robert de Fraunketon, and William de Boules.93 f For a full list of Peter Corbet's summonses, military, and Par liamentary, I refer elsewhere.94 He served in the campaign which closed the career of Lewellyn in December 1282. In 1287-8 he was often enlisted against the fickle and unfortunate Reste ap Mere dyth. He was excepted from the summons for Gascony in 1294, but included in that of 1295. In 1297 he was summoned both for foreign service and, later in the year, for service in Scotland. His last military summons was despatched from Berwick-upon-Tweed on Dec. 30, 1299, and was returnable at Carlisle on June 24, 1300. Meantime, a curious document informs us that Peter Corbet, like his Ancestors, was a lover of the Chace, and that wolves, so far from having been extirpated in England by King Edgar, as the story goes, were existent in the time of Edward I. A Patent of the latter King, dated May 4, 1281, informs all Bailiffs and Officers of the Forest that the King has commissioned Peter Corbet to destroy these beasts wherever they could be found in the Counties of Salop, Stafford, Gloucester, Worcester, and Hereford, using men, dogs, and other devices for that purpose ; and the said Bailiffs, etc., are desired to assist.95 The Feodary of 1284 states Peter Corbet's tenure of the Barony of Caus to be by service of five knights'-fees. For Some other par ticulars in the life of Peter Corbet I refer elsewhere^95 leaving to a note a solution of the doubt which has been thrown upon his alleged position as sometime Warden of the Host in the Army of Wales.96 In the Autumn of 1292 we find Peter Corbet impleaded under 96 A Writ of March 25, 1282, orders Peter Corbet to place himself and his forces under the command of Roger de Mortimer in the War against the Welsh. n Rot.

I shall here notice only those Suits which concerned his interests in Ford Hundred. \u2014 He was questioned for the exercise of sundry franchises in Min sterley. He allowed that he claimed infrangenthef and weyf there, and that he held two annual courts there, wherein all pleas were heard, which were ordinarily heard at a Sheriff's Tourn. This he justified by immemorial usage. The case was adjourned to Lich field, but I do not find that the King's Attorney pressed it further.97 He was questioned for withdrawing the Suit of Trevenaunt (Tref nant), Haregreve (Hargrave), Wenneton ( Winnington) , Wyclefeld (Whitfield, near Woolaston), Baghret, Perendon, Bronrotpoll, Wor thin, and thirteen other Vills, from the County of Salop and the King's Hundreds of Ford and Chirbury.97 Peter Corbet took several verbal and technical objections to the Writ and Form of procedure in this Suit, and particularly pointed out that the Hundred, from which each Vill had been withdrawn, ought to have been specified in every case, whereas the Writ made indistinctive mention of two Hundreds. The King's Attorney defended the Writ and form of procedure, and endeavoured to simplify the matter by stating that, whereas all the above Vills were in that jurisdiction of Corbet known as his Englecheria, he had withdrawn them into his Juris diction of Walcheria. The Attorney further pleaded that it was not necessary to specify the Hundred in each instance, as \" all the Vills owed Suit to one of two Hundreds.\" The Court quashed the prosecution, thinking the mode of procedure, by Writ of Quo Wa ranto, to have been inappropriate. Another prosecution of Peter Corbet was for holding Pleas of the Now, as Mortimer died in October fol lowing, the period when Peter Corbet acted as his Warden of the Host is ap parent. by a presentment of the Ford Jurors at the previous Assizes. They had aUeged that the VUls of Trevenant, Haregreve, Wonneton, Wytfeld, Varegrek, half Pern don, Bromrotepol, and Berleye had done suit to the Sheriff's- Tourn, tUl forty years since, when Griffin Wenhunwyn appro priated them to his Walcheria ; that Peter Corbet held them all, except Bromrotepol and Berleye, which Howel Picot held. The latter appeared and acknowledged that he owed the Suit in question, but Corbet's averment that the Manors were not in Shropshire, produced the Crown prosecution which foUowed. Mr. Blakeway, finding that at the As sizes of 1292 Peter Corbet's conduct in this Office was questioned, could not re concUe the seeming anachronism. He does not seem to have been aware that the Assizes of 1292 dealt with matters of twenty years' standing, no Pleas of the Crown having been heard at Shrewsbury since the Assizes of 1272. 97 Quo Waranto, pp. 677, 681.

As to Woneton (Winnington), Trevenaunt, Wytfeld, Waghort (before called Bagh ret and Vagheret), Heregreve, and the other half of Perendon, which was not of the fee of Botereus, \u2014he said that these were in Wal cheria, and not in Shropshire. The King's Attorney persisted that the said Vills were in Shropshire and in Ford Hundred; and a Jury, which tried the issue, confirmed the Attorney. The con quence was, that the Crown recovered its Franchises in these Vills, and they were reopened to the Sheriff, Coroners, and other King's Officers of Shropshire. Corbet had to compound for arrears of damage to the Crown-revenue by a Fine of 100s. As to Caws, Fenton, and Walhope, Corbet acknowledged them to be in Shrop shire, but said that, by immemorial usage of his Ancestors, no She riff, Coroner, or other Officer of the Crown, could enter these Vills. For them he claimed all the franchises now in question. They owed no suit to County or Hundred, nor were they bound to appear before the King's Justiciars, Sheriffs, Coroners, or other Officers, to make any presentment, or to do aught else pertaining to the Crown. The King's Attorney made the usual stand for the prerogative of the Crown, viz. that Caus, etc., were in Shropshire ; that the King was King of England, Shropshire included ; and that it was these very franchises which went to constitute the integral essence of Sovereignty ; moreover, that Corbet could show no Charter of any King, divesting the Crown of these franchises, and conferring them on himself, or his Ancestors.99 The cause was adjourned to Lich field, but not, that I can find, renewed there. But at Lichfield, in January 1293, Peter Corbet was sued, under another Writ of Quo Waranto, for exercising Free- Warren in Hemme, Trevenaunt (Trefnant), Haregreve, Weneton (Winning ton), Wytfeld, Vaghriet, Perndon, Bronrotpol, Berle, Munstrelegh, and other places. In eight of the places named, he denied that he exercised such right. Haregreve and Minsterley he seems to have held to be members of Caus or Worthen, and pleaded Henry III.'s Charter to his Father, which, by the way, made specific mention of a family stiU resident near Middletown HiU. 98 It is singular that, though the ViU of Borle, or Berleye, has quite disap peared, the name is preserved in that of 99 Placita de Quo Waranto, p. 686."], [50, "36 CAUS CASTLE. Minsterley as distinct from either Worthen or Caus. This same Writ^ I should perhaps here observe, questioned Peter Corbet for his exercise of free chace in the Boses of Letton (perhaps Leighton), Bretten (The Breidden), and Le Haye.1 To this he replied that the two first Boses were in Walcheria, and he was not bound to plead in the present Court on such a question ; and, as to the bosc of La Haye, that was a free chace, appurtenant to the Manor of Cauz, by immemorial usage. To this the King's Attorney rejoined that the Boses of Letton and Bretyng had been in Englecheria in King Richard's time, till Corbet's ancestors afforested the said boses, and usurped them iuto their Walcheria, to the loss of .the King's An cestors. Corbet rejoined that the said boses were in Walcheria in King Richard's time, and appealed to a Jury on that issue.2 At an adjourned hearing of the whole case (regarding Free Warren and Free Chace) Corbet at first appeared not, and the Court ordered his said Franchises to be suspended, and seized in manu Regis, till he should make an answer. This he appears to have done forthwith, and to such purpose as to obtain a dismissal sine die? An Inquest held December 21, 1299, on the death of Hawyse, widow of Reginald, fifth recorded Baron VaUetort, is worth notice. The Jurors found that \" Peter Corbet, aged 30 years and more\" (he must have been at least 52), \" and Henry de la Pomeray, aged 32, were heirs of the said Reginald.\" The facts, as far as Corbet was concerned, seem to have been as follows.\u2014 His Mother, Isabel, was a sister of Reginald, third Baron VaUetort, who had died in 1246 without issue. The said Reginald had been succeeded in turn by his brother Ralph, his nephew Reginald, and his brother Roger, who had none of them left any now surviving issue ; but Roger de VaUetort (Peter Corbet's maternal Uncle) had alienated all the VaUetort estates, except Herburton, and this was now in the Es cheator's hands, \" because Peter Corbet and Henry de la Pomeray had not prosecuted their claim thereto.\"4 A Writ of August 10, 1300, announces the death of Peter Corbet himself. An Inquest, held at Caus on August 28th, found the fol lowing facts as to the Manors of Binweston and Yokethull, viz. that Thomas, eldest son of the deceased, had married Johanna, daughter of Alan Plukenet, and died without issue; whereupon, that is, on November 11, 1295, Peter Corbet had, without license from the 1 Le Hay, \u2014 whose situation and name are still preserved in Haywood and the Forest of Hayes, west of Caus Castle. 2 Quo Waranto, p. 718. 3 Ibidem, p. 720. 4 Inquisitions, 27 Edw.

Again, on May 3, 1298, the said Peter had, without license, given Yokethull, in marriage, to his son Peter and Beatrice his wife, and the heirs of their bodies; but afterwards, and when 40 days had elapsed, Peter (the son) assenting, Peter (the father) had reseized Yokethull, and had died in possession thereof. The said Peter, Junior, was now said by the Jurors to be heir of his father, and aged 30 years and more.5 It has been said elsewhere that Alice, wife of Peter Corbet (I.), was the Mother of his three sons.6 This is probably a mistake. The Mother of Thomas, his eldest son, was named Joan. She was an heiress, and brought him a moiety of the issues of the Hundred of Bisselegh in Gloucestershire. Her son, Thomas, must have been born in or before 1266, he being of full age in 1287.7 Peter, the second son of Peter Corbet (I.), was, as we have seen, born in or before 1270, and was probably another son of Joan. But John the third son of Peter Corbet (I.), may well have been his son by a second wife, for he was not born till March 25, 1298, as we shall see in the sequel. Peter Corbet II. succeeded his father in 1300, and was sum moned to the Parliament of Lincoln, which met January 20, 1301. There, as Dominus de Cauz, he joined in the famous Letter of the Barons to Pope Boniface VIII., asserting King Edward's right to the Crown of Scotland.8 For a List of his other Summonses, Par liamentary and Military, I may refer elsewhere.8 In May 1303 a Fine was levied by precept of the King, between Peter Corbet and Beatrix his wife (Plaintiffs), and Hugh Bergam, Chaplain (Deforciant), of the Manors of Caus, Minsterley, Yoke thull, Worthyn, Wentnor, Schelve, Bynweston, Forton, Hemme, Overe Gorthor, Nethere Gorthor, and Baghaltref, whereof was Plea of Convention. Corbet acknowledged himself to have given the whole to the Deforciant, who in return concedes the Manors to Peter and Beatrix, and the heirs of Peter by Beatrix, \u2014 to hold of the King for ever. After the deaths of Peter and Beatrix, and in default of such heirs, the Manors were settled on the right heirs of Peter. Five years afterwards, the Devonshire Estates of Peter Corbet, at Hurburton and Brixham, were similarly settled, except that the remainder was to the right heirs, not of himself, but of his wifq Beatrix.

Pursuant thereto, an Inquest was held at Shrewsbury on the 29th of the same month. The Jury found that the deceased had died seized of nothing held in capite, his tenure of all the Manors named in the Fine of 1303 having been conjointly with Beatrix, his wife, who survived him. The Jury further set forth the tenure of these Manors as being a tenure-in-capite, per baroniam, and by service of five knights' fees. They valued the whole at 200 merks. The next heir of Peter Corbet (II.) was his brother John, a son of Peter Corbet (I.), which John was twenty-four years of age on March 25, 1322.10 John Corbet, the last Baron of Caus (if such a title can be as signed to one who never enjoyed his paternal estates and was never summoned to Parliament), died while yet his sister-in-law was seized of his Barony. His legitimacy has been questioned,11 with out, as I believe, the slightest foundation. He was living after the accession of Edward III. (1327), and was still prosecuting a claim on the VaUetort estates, of which he was the coheir in right of his Grandmother, the wife of Thomas Corbet. Those estates, which Peter Corbet (II.) had already claimed, were never recovered. They had been settled by the last Baron VaUetort in a way which was intended to exclude his collateral heirs, Corbet and Pomeray, that is, on Richard, King of Almagne and Earl of Cornwall, and the heirs of his body. It is true that the heirs of the Royal Earl failed in 1300, and that the next remainder was to the right heirs of Roger, last Baron VaUetort ; but the King had interest in the matter, as being heir to the general estates of the Earls of Corn wall, and the exertions of Corbet and Pomeray availed nothing against the Crown. Thus was John Corbet, the last rightful Baron of Caus, reduced to a position of comparative beggary, by the legal artifices of his own kindred on the one hand, and by barefaced injustice on the other.12 He died without issue before 1347.

Baroness of Caus, lived till 1347. A doubt has been expressed as to whether she was by birth a Fitz Alan or a Beauchamp.13 I am enabled to state positively that she was sister of that John, Baron Beauchamp of Hache, who died in 1336, and that her eventual heir was her great-nephew, viz. that John, Baron Beau champ of Hache, who died without issue in 1360. After Peter Corbet's death, Beatrix de Beauchamp remarried with Sir John de Leybourne, whom accordingly we find presenting to Caus Chapel in December 1346. Sir John de Leybourne survived his wife, and enjoyed, till his death (on Oct. 6, 1348), certain Devon shire estates which she had been enabled to settle upon him in 1330. Beatrix, herself, died August 28, 1347, seized in tail of the whole Shropshire Manor of the Corbets, both demesnes and feuds. At her death, the right heirs of Corbet of Caus were the great grandchildren of her first husband's aunts, viz. of Alice and Emma, daughters of Thomas Corbet. Alice, the eldest, had married Robert, Baron Stafford ; their son, Nicholas, had been succeeded by his son and heir, Edmund ; and Edmund was now represented by his sou and heir, Ralph, Lord Stafford. The esnecy, or elder moiety, of the Barony of Caus was now there fore annexed to the Barony of Stafford. The other moiety was subdivided ; for Emma, youngest daughter of Thomas Corbet, and wife of Brian de Brompton, was now represented by the families of two coheiresses, her great-grandchildren, viz. Margaret, wife of Robert de Harley, and Elizabeth, wife of Edmund de Cornwall. A Table already given will explain this.14 Suffice it to say that one fourth part of the Barony of Corbet is now in the heirs of Harley, and another fourth part in the heirs of Cornwall of Kinlet. In 1350, Ralph de Stafford paid 50 merks as his relief for a moiety of the Barony of Caus, which moiety consisted of the Cas tle and whole Manor of Caus, half the Manor of Worthyn and of three Mills there, the whole Manors of Minsterley and of Nether gorthere, and half the Manor of Bynweston. his father, Peter Corbet (I.). (Sheriffs, p. 65). There was also a John Corbet, who by grant of Peter Corbet (II.) and his wife, Beatrix, had a grant of Binweston for the life of Beatrix. I greatly doubt whether this John of Binweston was iden tical with John, son of Peter (I.). Un fortunately it does not appear what was the status of Binweston on Beatrix Cor- bet's death in 1347 (Inquis. 21 Edw. III., No. 55) ; but there was a Sir John Corbet of Binweston Uving in 1356, and then proposing to settle that Manor (which was his only estate) on his son John, and on Joan, his son's wife, and their issue.

Having now done with the Seigneury of Caus and the elder line of its possessors, I should say something of at least one Under tenant and Cadet of the elder House. We are told that the \u2014 Corbets of Leigh and Sundorne are descended from John, the last male Corbet of the elder line.15 No testimony or opinion can however shake the obvious fact that this John died without lawful issue. I am not suggesting the probability that there was any illegitimate descent in the matter, for I do not think that the Corbets of Leigh were descended from John Corbet at all. The Pedigree in the Visitation names Roger as the first Corbet of Leigh, and makes him to have been a younger son of Robert Corbet of Caus, who died in 1222. This also is false, as chronology and the following facts will show. \u2014 \" Peter Corbet (II.),\" so we are told, \"granted to his beloved nephew, Roger Corbet, all the chief custody of the bailiwick of all his Forest ; and this Forestership descended to the Corbets of Lee : hence it is certain that they descended from this Roger, who, it is probable, was the son of John.\"15 Now, I quite think that the Corbets of Leigh were descended from this Roger, but I confidently deny that Roger was the son of John. John Corbet was born March 25, 1298, and it is impos sible that he can have had any son eligible to the office of Forester in or before 1322, the last year of Peter Corbet's life. The word nephew, then (probably nepos in the original grant by Peter Corbet), I take to have been loosely used, and to mean nothing more than cousin. Such a use of the word is not a solecism.16 We will now see what Roger Corbet was, besides being Forester of Caus. In 1318, Roger Corbet of Caus was a Knight of the Shire, returned for Salop to the Parliament which met at York in October of that year. (Evidently then he was an older man than John Cor bet, his alleged father.) Roger Corbet of Caus was similarly re turned to the Parliament which assembled at Westminster on Feb. 23, 1324. He attended and obtained, on March 18, his Writ de expensis for so attending. Pursuant to a Writ of May 9, 1324, Roger Corbet of Legh juxta Caus, Knight, was returned by the Sheriff of Shropshire as summoned to attend the great Council of 15 Sheriffs of Shropshire, pp. 42, 65.\u2014 Some remains of the fortified mansion anciently caUed Lee Castle are still discern ible on a rocky knoU above Leigh Hah. Leigh, I should state, was not a mem ber of Caus, but of Worthen. It Ues about a mUe S.S.E. of the latter place. 16 Vide Ducange, sub roce Nepos. (i VII."], [56, "42 CAUS CASTLE. Westminster, on May 30. On August 27, 1325, Roger Corbet of Leghe was put in commission as a Conservator of the peace in the County of Salop. Again, as Roger Corbet of Caus, he was returned as a Knight of the Shire to the Parliament which met at Westmin ster on Nov. 18, 1325.17 In all these entries one person is described as of Leigh or of Caus, to distinguish him from his two cotemporaries, Roger Corbet of Morton, and Roger Corbet of Hadley or Tasley. This Roger was assuredly ancestor of the Corbets of Leigh ; but the question now arises, how he was himself related to the Barons of Caus. On this point I can only offer, a conjecture. The Visita tion says he was son of Robert Corbet, who died in 1222. That is impossible ; but the said Robert had one or more brothers, and se veral younger sons. One of the latter, also called Robert, was living at least as late as 1256 ;18 and from him perhaps was Roger Corbet of Leigh descended. A more immediate ancestor of Roger Corbet of Leigh was probably that Sir Roger Corbet whom we shall pre sently see to have been living in 1272, and then to have taken pre cedence of Sir Robert Corbet of Wattlesborough. Summarily, it may be safely stated of all the families of Corbets, which have branched off from the House of Caus, that none of them can be descended from any later Baron than he who died in 1222, and that therefore to decide their exact affinity to the Parent Stock must be the work rather of a Magician than an Antiquary. CAUS CHAPEL. Caus itself was parochially subject to Westbury, as were several of its members, hereafter to be particularized. As early apparently as 46 Hen. III. (1261-2), \" Thomas Corbet, Lord of Caus,\" enter tained the design of founding a Chapel of Caus. He then under takes that \" the Church of Westbury shall lose nothing by a Chantry of two Chaplains, whom, with consent of the Bishop of Here ford, he had placed in the Chapel of St. Margaret of Caus, which Chapel was situate in the Parish of Westbury.\" 17 Parliamentary Writs, IV. p. 717. There is a List of earlier and unappro priated summonses or writs, addressed to a Boger Corbet of Shropshire, from 1309 to 1317, and other summonses between 1321 and 1326, are similarly and indis tinctively addressed. It is probable that most of these relate to Roger Corbet of Hadley, who was a Tenant in capite ; but one or two may belong to Roger Corbet of Leigh. Dugdale (Baronage, p. 516, b.) teUs us of a Boger Corbet, summoned as a Baron in 1 Edw. III. (1327-8). It is difficult to say who this was. 18 Supra, Vol. III. p. 19."], [57, "43 MEMBERS OF CAUS. In 56 Henry III. (1271-2) Thomas Corbet seems to have completed this Foundation. He then gives \"to the Chapel of St. Margaret in the Vill of Caurs, for the sustenance thereof, and of two Chaplains, a messuage and 120 acres of demesne in the Vill of Caurs, and one meadow called Caldesfares medewe, and common pasture for 16 oxen, 6 cows, 100 ewe-sheep, 2 horses, and 50 hogs (quit of pannage), and housebote and haybote. Wit nesses, Sir Brian de Brompton, Sir Roger Corbett, Sir Robert Corbett, etc. The further history of this Chapel exists only in the names of one or two Incumbents. \u2014 Philip de Pontesbury, styling himself \" Rector of the Chapel of Caurs-Castle,\" was cited on Dec. 8, 1277, to appear before the Bishop and show what right of ingress he had in the said Chapel. On Dec. 3, 1346,\u2014 John de Ercalewe, Priest, was instituted to this Chapel on the presentation of Sir John de Leyborne, Knight, Lord of Caus.19 On June 8, 1491,\u2014 Master Thomas Morton, Archdeacon of Salop, was collated as Rector of this Chapel, the Bishop exercising the right of patronage, jure devoluto.30 The Townships or Members of Caus must have been very nu merous, if we may judge by the large area (20 hides) of the Domes day Manor. But it is probable that a great proportion of this hidage was in Walcheria, and was annexed to vills which lay about the Breidden Hill and the Long Mountain. It is a very difficult matter even to identify the vills which constituted the Walcheria of any given Manor of the Borders. So I must leave the Walcheria of Caus almost unnoticed ; for even if I could define its boundaries, I could add no account of its vills, for the very essence of a Wal cheria excluded it from all but accidental mention in English Records. The following places in the Parish of Westbury were, I think, manorially members of Caus, viz. Vennington, Forest, Wallop, Westley, Lake, Hurst, and Hem. Of some of these I have made incidental mention already, and can only add the following par ticulars about two of them. \u2014 - Wallop. \u2014 In 1256, when the County Court declared that Wal lop, like Caus, owed no Suit to the Assizes,31 Reginald de Hanvvood, 19 He was second husband of Beatrix, I 20 Blakeway's MSS. widow of Peter Corbet (II.) of Caus. 21 Supra, pp. 26, 27 21 Supra, pp. 26, 27."], [58, "44 CAUS CASTLE. whom we shall hear of again, held the vill under Corbet. In 1267, there was a Hugh de Wallop, who, at the Assizes of that year, sued Thomas Corben (Corbet) for disseizing him of a tenement in Kene ton. The Justiciars could not interfere, for it was proved that no Writ-Royal concerning a tenement in Kemton could run, because Kemton was in Sir Thomas Corbet's Liberty and without the boundaries of the County. Again, at these Assizes, Richard de Walop sued Thomas Corbet for disseizing him of a tenement in Walop, viz. a messuage and a noke. Corbet replied that Walop was extra metas Comitatds, and that this complaint had previously been heard and quashed at the Eyre of the Abbot of Peterborough and his fellow-justices, whose Roll (the Assize-Roll of 1256) Corbet called to warranty. Vennington. \u2014 When in 1256 Feniton was declared to owe no suit to the County Assizes, it was held, under Corbet, by Roger Burnel and Robert Lowys, of whom we shall hear more under Whitton. Thus the only notices which we have about these members of Caus are of that exact kind which explains the scarcity of such allusions. The Crown had in short no jurisdiction in Caus or its members. The following places in the Parish of Alberbury were, I think, members of Caus, viz. Hargrave, Bulthey, Winnington, Whitfield, and Trefnant. I have no further particulars to relate about either, tjjan those already given. In the same district, about the Breidden, were -Bromrochpol, Bromrochpol secunda, Perendon, and the place so variously written as Waghort, Vagheret, Baghret, Boghaltre, or Bagheltref. None of these am I able to identify with existing vills, unless the last be identical with Bulthey. It seems however that all the western part of Alberbury Parish was within the land of Gordowr.23 There is an award by Richard, Bishop of Hereford, dated July 26, 1289, which well illustrates the topography of this much-changed district. It is a decision concerning the tithes of fourteen vills in the parts of Gordowr (Hereford Diocese), which tithes were claimed by Brother Peter de Corcellis, Corrector or Prior of the Religious House of the Grandimontane Order at Alberbury on the one part, and by John (son of the Lotrd Griffin late Lord of La Pole), Rector of the Church of La Posefand Griffin fitz Eden weth, Vicar of the same Church, on the other part. The Vills enu merated are, Balislee (Bausley), Bragynton (Bragginton), Berlee, 2- The British word Gorthir signifies Upper country."], [59, "45 MINSTERLEY. Bromrochpol, Bromrochpol secunda, Wonyntone (Winnington), Wichfeld, Perendon, Haregrene (Hargrave), Trifhant (Trefnant), Trif-Bereved, Hochelprene, Krigion (Criggion), and Orleton.23 The six identified vills will adumbrate the district which contained the eight others ; but I have nothing to say about any of these Vills except Perendon, which, as we have seen, was divided between Corbet and Botreaux. An interesting piece of history attaches to this Vill, which shall be given under Marsh. Meantime it is sufficient to state that, whereas Botreaux's moiety of Perendon was certainly not a member of Caus, it may be doubted whether Cor bet's moiety did not originally belong to some other Manor. Cotes, a member of Caus which I cannot now trace, was held in 1255 by Richard de Cotes, whose non-attendance at the Ford Hun dred-Court was reported in the Inquest of that year.2* John de Cotes is one of those Corbet Tenants who were protected by a Patent of June, 1263, as already stated. In November, 1274, Madoc de Cotes was holding one virgate in the estate of Thomas Corbet, deceased, by service of 5s. annual rent. Having now concluded my account of Caus, the caput of Roger fitz Corbet's Barony, I will proceed first with the Manors which his Successors held in demesne, and afterwards with those which he or they conferred upon their Retainers. \u2014 jHtnsterlep- Domesday describes this Manor as follows. \u2014 \" The Earl himself holds Menistrelie, and Roger (fitz Corbet, I presume) holds it of him. King Edward held it (in Saxon times). Here are vi hides, geldable. In demesne there are ii ox-teams, and there might be two more (employed) here. Here are viii Villains and mi Boors, with viii teams. Here are mi Neat-herds. There are two leagues (leuuedes) of wood. In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 60s. (per annum), now it is worth 5_\\ more.\"1 23 Register, Swinfield, so. 61 a.

It is not from Domesday alone, nor from one passage only of Domesday, that I infer Minsterley to have been a much more im portant place in Saxon times than it has been since. The very name of Minsterley indicates that it was the site of one of those Saxon and Collegiate Churches which I have so often mentioned as the centres of Parishes whose extent we can hardly overrate. Minster ley, I take it, was the Mother-Church of at least Westbury and Habberley, but the Collegiate Church has from time immemorial, that is from before Domesday, been at Westbury ; and Minsterley has been the Chapel. Again Minsterley, as a Manor, probably in cluded Habberley, both in Saxon times and at Domesday. In Hab berley is a place still called Marstley ; and I infer from a curious passage in Domesday, that the Saxon King- Lords of Minsterley had a Park at Marstley. \u2014 It is recorded among the ancient customs of Shrewsbury, that when the King visited the Town \" the Sheriff used to send thirty-six footmen as his body-guard (ad stabilitionem) , for so long as he remained there. But for the Park of Marsetelie (the Sheriff) used customarily to find thirty-six men, for eight days,\"2 that is, I presume, the Sheriff provided the King's body-guard when he went to hunt at Marstley, and in the adjacent Royal Forest of The Stiperstoues. Speaking for the present of Minsterley as distinct from its member, Habberley, I find constantly recurring evidences that the Corbets held it almost uniformly in demesne. Its proximity to Caus, and its site, between Caus Castle and the Stiperstones Forest, will make such an arrangement intelligible enough. So close in deed became the association between Caus and Minsterley that neither the Feodary of 1255, nor that of 1284, takes any notice of Minsterley as a distinct Manor. Mindful of this, I have already given under Caus nearly every quotation which treats of Minsterley in connection with Caus. From the Extent, taken in October 1274, I find that Thomas Corbet, deceased, had held 2 carucates at Minsterley, in demesne, while Robert le Ponde and Robert de la Lake were enfeoffed in small parcels there. In the final partition of the Corbet estates, Caus and Minsterley went wholly to one coheir, the Baron Stafford. That which remains to be said distinctively of Minsterley is neces sarily little.\u2014 At the Assizes of 1203 Robert Corbet surrendered 60 acres in Minsterleg to two females, Sibil and Petronil, who had 2 Domesday, so. 252, a, 1."], [61, "47 HABBERLEY. sued him for the same under writ of mort d'ancestre? In Hilary Term 1243 the Abbot of Buildwas was suing Thomas Corbet at Westminster for a right of road (de placito chemini) in Munstreleg. The case was adjourned to Easter Term, and in Trinity Term was settled by a Fine, wherein it appears that the right of road sought, was through a meadow of Corbet's to a meadow of the Abbot's, which lay beyond. The Abbot (Nicholas) renounced his claim, where upon Corbet gave him ingress and egress in every or any direction to the said meadow, it being understood that both parties were to adhere to all the articles of a previous and much more elaborate fine, which, as it had nothing to do with Minsterley, I shall set forth elsewhere. The Feodary of 1316 registers Peter Corbet as Lord of Munster legh.4 Minsterley Chapel. \u2014 This Chapel, as I have said, probably suc ceeded a Saxon and Collegiate Church, which at' some unrecorded period was transferred to Westbury, and on which Minsterley re mained, and still remains, dependent. The early Registers of Here ford seldom notice such Chapels ; and there is utter silence about Minsterley in the Valor of Henry VIII. and in all previous Records. Not till the year 1694 is the Chapelry mentioned in the Diocesan Registers. HABBERLEY. Of this presumed member of Minsterley an early feoffment seems to have been made by one of the Barons of Caus. The Feoffee was some Progenitor of that family of Arundel which I have already shown to have held Tetneshull and Merebrook under the same Barons, and half Cantlop under the Pichfords.6 I have some fur ther particulars to record of this family as connected with Hab berley. As early as 1180 a number of the Vassals of Corbet of Caus ap pear as having been amerced pro falso judicio facto Fulkoni filio Warini. I suppose that Fulk fitz Warin, himself a Corbet Tenant, had been unjustly dealt with in some local Court, and by his Compeers, and had appealed to the Curia Regis. Ten merks, the highest penalty inflicted, was the penalty of Adam de Arundel. In November 1221 we have William de Arundel standing as 5 Supra, Vol. IV. pp. 351-355 ; Vol. VI. p. 287. 3 Assizes, 5 John, m. 4 dorso. 4 Parliamentary Writs, IV. 399."], [62, "48 MINSTERLEY. Surety for Gerin Burnell and William Corbet. He was, I think, of this family, and possibly may have been the very William de Arun del, who, in a former Volume, has occurred as the husband of Sibil de Broc, heiress of Chetton.6 If so, this William de Arundel pro bably died without issue ; and Adam de Arundel (who occurs in or about 1240 as holding half a fee in Habberley under Thomas Cor bet)7 was his collateral heir. The Feodary drawn up on Thomas Corbet's death in 1274 gives John de Arundel as his Tenant, by service of one knight's-fee. The mode in which Habberley passed from the Arundels to the Corbets of Wattlesborough and Morton, has already been shown, and how Matilda, Robert Corbet's widow, died seized thereof in 1309.8 It is obvious, I think, that this Ma tUda was heiress of the Arundels, but I am far from being able to assign her place in the pedigree of that family.9 Her son and heir, Thomas Corbet, was, according to the Inquest on his Father's death, born on December 25, 1281, according to that on his Mother's death, on May 25, 1284. The earlier Inquest and date is in such cases most to be relied on. On December 13, 1309, the said Thomas Corbet, and Robert his son, are stated by Inquest to have acquired from Sir John le Strange of Ercalwe, the Manor of Habberleye, to hold to Thomas and Robert and the heirs of Robert, under Sir Peter Corbet of Cawes, by service of one knight's-fee.10 This was obviously a settlement, made through the medium of John le Strange as feoffee in-trust. Thomas Corbet died before May 7, 1310, leaving his said son, Robert, his heir; but he having been born on December 25, 1304, had still a long minority before him. Hence, I suppose, it came to pass that in the Nomina Villarum of 1316, the Seigneural Lord of Habberley, Peter Corbet, was enrolled as Lord of the Vill,11 he having it, at that time, in custodia cum herede. Of Undertenants in Habberley I offer a few loose notes. A family named Coudray had an interest here. Ernald de Coudray was, at the Assizes of 1256, alleged by his heirs to have given in gress to Henry Robyn and his wife Edith in half a virgate in Nethercote. Peter de Coudray, son of Ernald, was similarly alleged 6 Supra, Vol. I. p. 176. 7 Testa de Nevill, pp. 45, 48, 50. 8 Supra, Vol. IV. pp. 354-5. 9 It is observable that in September 1272 the Jurors of Condover Hundred reported Matilda de Arundel as a De faulter in respect of due attendance at the Assizes. This was long before the male line of Arundel was extinct, and be fore Matilda married Robert Corbet. She must at the time have been the Widow of some previous husband. 10 Inquisitions, 3 Edw.

Again, Ernald Atestope, while guardian of Matilda and Edith, daughters and heirs of Peter Coudray, was similarly alleged to have demised three acres in Nethercote to the same Richard Lune, who had transferred them to Robert Lune. Robert Lune and Henry Robyn were now impleaded as having had wrongful ingress in all the premises. The Plaintiffs were Matilda Coudray and her niece Emma, daughter of Edith Coudray. Their suits seem to have failed in every instance.12 Early, as I think, in the fourteenth century, \"William, son of Sir Roger, Parson of Habberleye, gives to William fitz Madoc of Pontesford, for a sum of money, that messuage and nokate within the Vill of Habberleye, which the Grantor had by gift of John de Arundel, former Lord of Habberleye.

This district was in Saxon times probably within the Parish of Minsterley, but when Westbury became the central Church of that Parish, Habberley, if founded so early, was a Chapel subject to Westbury. Whenever founded, its original subjection is undoubted; for neither does the Taxation of 1291 recognize Habberley as a parish church, nor does the Inquisition of 1341 recognize Habberley as a distinct Parish. In the Valor of 1534-5, however, its inde pendence is clearly marked. The preferment of Roger Jenks', then Rector of Haburley, in the Deanery of Pontesbury, was valued at \u00a34. Os. 2d. per annum, in glebe and tithes, less 6d. payable to the Archdeacon for synodals.14* EARLY INCUMBENTS. These were not nominated by the Co- Rectors of Westbury, but by the Lords of the Manor.

Edric the Saxon Lord of Yockleton, Wattlesborough, Loton, and Hanwood (all in Ruesset Hundred), was probably Edric Sylvaticus. Of him I have already spoken.3 Yockleton, anciently written Yocklehull, was almost uniformly held in demesne by the Corbets of Caus. Under Caus, therefore, I have inserted the chief particulars of its history, and especially of that grant of the tithes of Yocklehull which the first Roger Corbet made to Shrewsbury Abbey. That grant had Episcopal as well as Royal confirmation. Bishop Betun's Charter, already stated to have passed about 1138,4 ensures to the Abbey the tithes of the demesne of Thokethul ; and a Confirmation, supposed to be that of Bishop Gilbert Foliot (1148-1164), concedes both the great and small tithes of Jokethull to the Abbey.5 In 1255 the Jurors of Ford Hundred made no mention of Yock leton as a distinct Manor, but they reported how the Vill of Yokel cul had ofttimes deprived the King's Bailiff of things taken by him in security for a Crown debt, or for some other attachment. The names of these assertors of a local immunity were John Sire, Wil liam Provost of Yokelcul, Robert Lucas, William fitz Osbert, and Roger Fur et.6 At the Assizes of 1267, Thomas Corbet, William Bont, and Daniel Russel were sued by Roger Gothmund and Agnes his wife for disseizing them of a messuage and virgate in Yoketille, and a messuage and quarter-virgate in Horton. The disseizin in Horton was proved, but not that in Yoketille.7 A Patent of 1270 shows Roger Gothemund with a new Writ against Thomas Corbet for disseizin in Yokethul. A Survey of Corbet estates, taken in October 1274, states that Thomas Corbet, deceased, had held 4 carucates in demesne at Yo kelehul, while Roger Burnel had held 1\\ virgates and Roger Coly had held half a virgate there, under the said Baron.8 At the Assizes of 1292, Humphrey de Beauchamp and Alice his wife were sued by William fitz John of Stretton for disseizing him of a right of common in Stretton juxta Yokethul, which right he alleged to appertain to his free tenement in Yokethul. The Defen dants and the Jury agreed that the said common was in Neweton, and not in Stretton;9 thus taking a distinction, I think, between 3 Supra, Vol. III. pp. 48-50. 4 Supra, Vol. i.p. 35. 7 Assizes, 51 Hen.

Newton, a member of Westbury, and Stoney- Stretton, a member of Yockleton. I have related, under Caus, how Peter Corbet (I.) in 1298 gave Yokelhull as a marriage-gift to his son Peter, and his son's wife Beatrice, and the heirs of their bodies. He soon resumed the estate, with consent of his son, and died seized thereof. When, therefore, we find Peter Corbet (II.) resettling Yockleton in 1303, and entered in the Nomina Villarum of 1316 as Lord of the Vill of Yokelton, we know that it came to him in the regular course of inheritance. His widow Beatrix of course held the Manor for her life, under the said settlement of 1303. In the partition of 1347, between the Coheirs of Corbet, Yockelton, and Stretton went to Robert, son of Robert de Harley and Margaret de Brompton. Parochially both Yockleton and Stoney Stretton belonged to Westbury. The corn-tithes, however, of Yockleton continued with Shrewsbury Abbey till its Dissolution. The Valor of 1534 shows them to have been then fermed for \u00a31. 3s. 4d. per annum.

Nicholas surren dered the land ; his Surety being Robert de Esmerillum, of whom we shall hear more under Woolaston. In Michaelmas Term 1230, and Easter Term 1231, a Grand Assize was pending at Westminster, between Thomas Corbet (of Caus) and Robert fitz John, concerning a virgate in Stratton, of which Robert asserted his father to have been seized in the time of Henry II. , while Corbet arrogated a right of holding it in demesne. The result appears in a Fine of November 23, 1236, whereby Robert fitz John first renounces all claim to the premises, and then Corbet enfeoffs Robert fitz John therein, at a rent of 8s. Perhaps this Robert fitz John was iden tical with Robert de Esmerillum. In 1255 we have a list of Stretton freeholders presented by the Jurors of Ford Hundred, for repeatedly withholding, or rescuing, things taken in pledge by the Crown Officers for Crown debts. The names of the Difforciants were 16 in number. Among them were William Russel and his son Daniel, Richard le Mey, William Bagot, Simon Burnel, William Blunt, William Grene, and Roger Cely (read Coly).18 '\" Rot. Hundred.

His name will recur to us under Woolaston. \u0153estfmrp* This Manor is classified in Domesday among those which Roger fitz Corbet held of the Norman Earl. \u2014 \"The same Roger holds Wesberie. Ernui held it (in Saxon times), and was free. Here are ii hides, geldable. In demesne is one ox-team ; and (there are) one Serf, two Priests, and v Villains, with in teams. It was worth (in Saxon times) 20s. (per annum); now it is worth 25s.\"1 The mention of two Priests indicates the existence of a Collegiate Church here. This, as I have suggested, had been transferred from Minsterley. Ernui, the Saxon, had enjoyed four Manors in Ruesset Hundred. He was living at Domesday, aud still holding three of those Manors under Roger fitz Corbet or his brother. Westbury was the excep tion. At Domesday Roger fitz Corbet held it in demesne ; but be fore the end of the next century, an Ancestor of the Hodnets, here ditary Seneschals of Montgomery Castle, was Corbet's Feoffee at Westbury. \u2014 Sir Odo de Hodnet, the first of these Seneschals of whom I have sure notice, has already been shown to have attested a Deed of Robert Corbet of Caus in or about the year 1198.3 The same Deed is attested by William fitz Odo, whom I know to have been a Clerk, and a younger son of Odo de Hodnet. The Haughmond Chartulary contains a nearly cotemporary Deed attested by Odo de Westbury, William fitz Picot, William fitz Hodo, Henry Hager, Roger Porcel, and William de Aqua.3 These were all Tenants of the Barons of Caus, and Odo de Westbury was of course identical with Odo de Hodnet. In Easter Term, 1200, Sir Odo de Hodenet appears as one of twelve Shropshire Knights who were to try the cause of Grand Assize mentioned under Nordley Regis.4 It was probably in the year 1201 that the third Fulk fitz Warin, disappointed in certain claims on King John, organized a rebellion 3 Tit. Modlicote. 4 Supra, Vol. III. p. 157. 1 Domesday, so. 255, b, 2. 2 Supra, p. 18."], [68, "54 WESTBURY. or conspiracy, for which he and his adherents were outlawed. The Fitz Warms and Hodnets were associated as Lord and Vassal,5 and as Fellow Vassals of Corbet of Caus. An expression in the Fitz Warin Chronicle suggests that they were relations by blood. Cer tain it is that Odo de Hodnet's eldest son, Baldwin, joined Fulk fitz Warin and shared both his outlawry and exile. Stephen de Hod net, another of the Outlaws, was perhaps a younger brother of Bald win's. This Outlawry lasted till November 1203. Meanwhile, that is in 1201, the very year on which I suppose Fulk fitz Warin to have rebelled, Odo de Hodnet seems to have died. His eldest son, Baldwin, was of course, as an attainted person, disqualified to succeed. It would appear that \u2014 Walter de Hodnet, the second son of Odo, obtained Livery of Hodnet, or of whatever the Hodnets held in capite as Seneschals of Montgomery. I strongly suspect that Robert Corbet of Caus, Seigneural Lord of Westbury, was not so ready as King John to admit the claims of the second son, or to ignore the claims of the exiled Baldwin. It is but a line on a plea-roll which suggests this idea. \u2014 On November 25, 1201, Walter fitz Odo had a plea of land, pending against Robert Corbet, and Corbet essoigning himself, the cause was adjourned.6 Within two years of this time, and whde Baldwin de Hodnet was still an Outlaw, Walter fitz Odo, his Bro ther, died without issue. Forthwith \u2014 William fitz Odo, the Clerk, and probably the next unattainted Brother, put in his claim. The Shropshire Pipe-Roll for the year ending Michaelmas 1203 contains the following Oblatum proffered to King John. \u2014 Willelmus filius Odonis de Hodenet debet 20 marcas pro habendd terrd qu\u00e6 suit Walteri fratris sui die quo obiit, cujus h\u00e6res est, et pro relevio suo. This Fine, so obvious in its meaning, was never liquidated, and the reason is apparent. On September 12, 1203, a Patent of King John promises safe-conduct to Fulk fitz Warin and Baldwin de Hodnet, if they will come to the King.7 An other Patent dated at Caen, November 15, 1203, pardons Fulk fitz Warin and his adherents, and revokes their outlawry. The list of the Inlagati contains the names of Baldwin de Hodenet and Ste phen de Hodnet.8 Moreover Baldwin de Hodnet had letters of the King, bearing date at Bonville on the same 13th of November, and ordering that he should \"have seizin of the land which was his 5 Hodnet held Welbatch and Moston, under Fitz Warin (supra, Vol. VI. pp. 119, 120). 6 Placita, Roll 3 John (No. 17), m. 27. 7 Rot.

Father's, as entirely as his Father had it on the day when Baldwin left the King's service.\"9 Baldwin de Hodnet, thus restored to his tenures in capite, was doubtless repossessed of Westbury by Robert Corbet of Caus, one of whose subsequent Charters has the said Baldwin's attestation.10 In the year 1204 Baldwin de Hodnet married Cecily, daughter and sole heir of Alan de Hadley, and Widow of Roger Corbet of Tasley. He thus became enriched by this Lady's dower in Tasley, and having by her a son, Odo, he also became Tenant for life of her own much richer inheritance. These things have already been stated,11 and I may proceed with other facts in the life of Baldwin de Hodnet. In 1210 he accompanied King John to Ireland. He was with the King at Pembroke on June 6, at Dublin on June 28, at the siege of Carrickfergus on July 20, and at Dublin again on August 21.12 In or about the year 1211 we have it recorded how Baldwin de Hodenet was Tenant -in-capite (in right of his wife) of the Staffordshire Manor of Bromley Regis.13 In 1215, Baldwin de Hodnet had shown new signs of disaffection to King John ; for a Patent of June 2nd bids him come to the King, and promises to pardon his fault and reward his services. The invitation was not accepted ; for further Writs, of November 19, 1215, and March 28, 1216, show that his forfeited lands in Staffordshire were in the hands of Geoffrey de Can vill, by will of King John.14 On November 3, 1217, he had returned to the allegiance of young King Henry ; and a Writ to the Sheriff of Gloucestershire orders that he should have such seizin of his lands as he had when he left the service of King John.10 What lands Baldwin de Hodnet may have had in Gloucestershire I have not been able to discover. On the 11th of July, 1223, King Henry being at Worcester, orders the Sheriff of Shropshire to give Baldwin de Hodenet full seizin of the Castle of Kinardeslegh ; and, if anything had been taken thence since its seizure into the King's hands, Baldwin was to have it back again.16 A similar precept, dated at Montgomery, on October 9th following, relates more es pecially to the land of Kinardesle, which is described as Baldwin de Hodenet's.17 The history of the Border Castle here named is some what obscure, but may be postponed for future consideration.

It appears from a Writ of March 24, 1224, that the King had fully ascertained that his faithful and beloved Baldwin de Hodenet was entitled to the Seneschalcy of the Honour of Montgomery. Godeschall de Ma ghelines (Custos of that Honour) was to give him full seizin of the said Seneschalcy.18 Another Writ of June 16, 1224, shows that Baldwin de Hodenet had in hand, or was to receive, as Seneschal, all the issues of the said Honour. He is ordered to hand them over to Hubert Hose and the aforesaid Godeschall, to be expended on the works of Montgomery Castle. The same Hubert, Godeschall, and Baldwin are also ordered to allow the knights and free-tenants of the Honour to take a reasonable quantity of timber out of the Woods of Muntgomery, wherewith to strengthen their fortalices in that district.19 A Writ dated at Montgomery on October 1, 1224, excuses Baldwin de Hodenet one-half of an amercement of 40s., which had been set upon him by the Justices recently in eyre at Shrewsbury. Other Writs, dated at Hereford on October 4, 1224, show that the King had left Baldwin de Hodnet not only as Seneschal, but as a Custos of the Honour of Montgomery. In that capacity he is ordered to be ready with his account of receipts and disbursements, whenever summoned by the King.30 But another Summons was awaiting Baldwin de Hodnet. On January 21, 1225, he was dead, and all his lands were ordered to be seized by the Sheriff of Shropshire and to be given up to the custody of that Godeschall de Maghelines who was so lately his Colleague in pro vincial trusts.21 A furthur Writ of the King, dated February 12, 1225, orders the said Godescal to retain whatever the deceased held of the Honour of Montgomery, but to give up to Fulk fitz Warin (as Seigneural lord) those lands at Welbatch and Moston which Baldwin had held under him.22 Odo de Hodnet (IL), Baldwin's eldest son by Cecilia de Hadley, was a minor at his father's death. It may help us to estimate the circumstances under which the testing-clauses of ancient charters were drawn up, if I state that, in a grant to Haughmond Abbey, Baldwin de Hodnet's attestation was followed by that of Odo his son.23 On October 5, 1225, William de Hodnet (Uncle, I doubt not, of the Minor) gave the King 40 merks for custody of the land and heir of Baldwin de Hodnet, so far as he was a Tenant-in-capite in the Honour of Montgomery.

The Feodaries of 1240 duly register Odo de Hodenet as holding one knight's-fee in Westbury, of the Barony of Thomas Corbet.25 By a Fine of November 22, 1248, Thomas Corbeth (Tenant) surrenders for 2 merks to Odo de Hodenet (Plaintiff) two acres in Westbyr', whereof had been suit of mort d'ancestre. In Easter Term, 1250, Odo de Hodnet was again Plaintiff against Thomas Corbet in a Plea of customs and services. On the Ford Hundred-Roll of 1255, Odo de Hodenet is regis tered as holding two hides, geldable, in Welbur' of the Fee of Caus. He did Suit to both County and Hundred.26 At the Assizes of 1256, a plea, pending between Thomas Corbet and Odo de Hodenet, is mentioned ; but the former is Plaintiff, and his object is to compel the Defendant to appear and hear sentence in their previous suit about customs and service?1 In August, 1257, and May, 1258, Odo de Hodnet has two Writs of novel dis seizin against Thomas Corbet and others, for disseizing him of his free tenement in Westbir'. Robert Waleran was the Justice ap pointed, in the later Writ, to determine the Suit ; aud in Michael mas Term, 1260, Corbet was suing Hodnet at Westminster to come forward and hear Waleran's decision. Hodnet appeared not, and the Court ordered the Sheriff to compel his appearance in Hilary Term, by distraint. In Trinity Term, 1263, Roger de Merse (a Tenant of Corbet's) is suing Odo de Hodenet for the Manor of Westbyr'.28 A Patent of September 21, 1265 (the month after the battle of Evesham), shows Odo de Hodnet as a Royalist. He and Philip le Bret are Commissioners to confiscate generally the estates of those who had opposed the Crown in the late civil wars. The people of Staffordshire and Shropshire were to aid the Commissioners, and the Estates were to be forthwith valued. This Patent issued from Winchester, where a Council of Magnates had voted the King seizin of all such estates. At the Assizes of October, 1272, Sir Odo de Hodenet sat as a Juror on several causes of Grand Assize. In one, he himself, as Tenant of the Manor of Westbyr', got a Verdict of twelve Knights 24 Rot.

The Inquest on Thomas Corbet's death in 1274, registers Odo de Hodeneth as Tenant of a knight's-fee in the Barony of the deceased, and as owing Suit every three weeks to the Court of Caus.30 I shall have more to say of Odo de Hodnet under the Manor whence his family took its name. He died probably at the age of sixty-seven. The Writ of Diem clausit announcing his death bears date Feb. 10, 1284. An Inquest, held on the 15th, declares him to have held Westbury under Peter Corbet for one knight's-fee, and values the Manor at \u00a35. 10s. 8d. per annum. Wdliam, son and heir of the deceased, was of full age,31 and had livery of his tenures in-capite that same year.32 At the Assizes of 1292, the Jurors of Ford Hundred made an extraordinary, and, as it seems to me, vexatious presentment, viz. that Richard de Hodenet held a messuage, a carucate of land, and a Mill in Heysord juxta Westbury, of the King's Serjeantry of Hod net. In vain the Tenant protested that he held the premises under \u2014 William de Hodnet, and had acquired them by Fine with the said William's father, Odo, in 9 Edw. I. (1280-1) . He had to fine 1 merk to have possession of his estate till the next Parliament.33 Sir William de Hodnet, Knight, was a Juror on the Great Forest Perambulation of 1300. It is well known that Matilda, daughter and sole heiress of Sir William de Hodnet, married William de Ludlow. A Fine levied on July 1, 1301, is but a settlement of several Hodnet Estates on William de Hodnet for Use, with remainder to his daughter and her heirs. In technical language, \" William de Hode net (Plaintiff in a Plea of Convention) acknowledges his gift to William de Lodelewe and Matilda his wife (Deforciants) of the Manors of Westbury, Welbeche, Moston, and Esheley, also of 5 acres of land, 8 acres of pasture, and 70 acres of bosc in Wylbeleye- Corbet and Wolureton. In return, the Grantees concede the pre mises to Hodnet for life, to hold at a rent of one rose, payable to themselves and to the heirs of Matilda, and by discharge of all ser vices clue to the Lords of the Fees.

He was living on November 7, 1302, and was then put on a Commission to collect an Aid in Shropshire.34 In March, 1316, the return called Nomina Villarum, while it makes William de Ludlow to be Lord of Westbury, has William de Hod net as Lord of Hodnet.35 The accuracy of this may be doubted ; for the Inquest held at Shrewsbury on November 11, 1316, on the death of \u2014 William de Ludlow, states that he and his wife Matilda had held conjointly the Manor of Hodenet by feoffment of one William, formerly Lord of Hodnet. They had also conjointly held the Manor of Westbury by feoffment of William de Hodnet. It was held (of Peter Corbet) for a knight's-fee, and was valued at \u00a321. 19s. per annum. Laurence de Ludlow, son of the deceased, was ap parently in his 16th year.36 The Inquest taken July 12, 1347, on the death of his mother Matilda, makes Laurence de Ludlow to have been 42 years of age on December 25, 1346, which is probably four years short of the truth.37 Laurence de Ludlow, it seems, had, about the year 1338, con veyed Stokesay and other estates and effects derived from his father to certain Feoffees-in-trust. On September 27, 1346, he was out lawed at the suit of John Wyard, for assaulting the said John, vi et armis; but, owing to the above settlement, the Sheriff could find no thing of the outlaw's estates or chattels to extend and seize. But on his mother's death the case was altered. Whatever came to Lau rence de Ludlow from her, was seized by John Delves, then Sheriff, pursuant to a Mandate of February 18, 1348, and Ludlow himself was arrested. The estates, now valued for the Crown, include _\u00a316. 12s., assized rents in Westbury ; \u2014 40s., the value of a caru cate of land in Welbatch ; and certain rents in the latter vill?3 Laurence de Ludlow probably obtained a reversal of his outlawry, and seizin of his estates. He died October 14, 1353. The Inquest, ordered on October 18, and held on October 31 following, states that Hawise, his wife, survived him, and that John de Ludlow, his son and heir, was thirty-three years of age on May 6, 1353.39 \u2014 Of Undertenants in this Manor I have no certain notices.

WESTBURY CHURCH. This Church, existent before Domesday, and even then Collegiate, was, I have supposed, originally transferred from Minsterley.41 The two Priests of Domesday were types of the two Prebendaries or Rectors who appear in all later Records as sharing the emoluments of this Church. In 1290, two days of Bishop Swinfield's Visitation (May 2nd and 3rd) were passed at Westbury -juxta-Caus. On the first of these days the Bishop and his Suite were entertained at the expense of the Bishop. Kid and Roe-deer were (in character with the district) adjuncts of their feast. Hay, corn, and litter, for the horses of the party, were supplied gratis by John de Lucham (or Ludham) one of the Prebendaries. On May 3, the Bishop and his household were entertained by the \" free hospitality \" of Sir William de Hodenet.42 The Taxation of 1291 names the Church of Westbury as having two Rectors. It was in the Deanery of Pontesbury, and was valued at \u00a320. per annum?3 On May 10, 1310, we have a curious entry in Bishop Swinfield's Register, viz. the formal admission by the Bishop, of Sir William de Castle Holegod, Priest, to be Sacristan, or, as we should now say, Sexton, of Westbury. The Patron of the Prebendal Stalls, Sir William de Ludlow, had presented this Sacristan ; and the Bishop, instituting him, addressed customary letters to the Parochial Priest of Westbury, who was ordered to induct.44 In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth, quoting the Church-Taxation of \u00a320., rated this Parish at 20 merks (\u00a313. 6s. 8d.) to the current Levy. The Glebe land, worth 40s. per annum, the hay-tithes worth 40s., the oblations and small tithes worth 40s. were reckoned in the Taxation, but were not computable in reckoning the Ninth. Also a great part of the Parish lay untilled, the Tenants being poor.45 40 Supra, p. 51. 41 Supra, p. 46. 43 Pope Nich. Taxation, p. 167, b. 44 Regist. Swinfield, so. 168, b. 45 Inquis.

It is difficult to fix the respective Portions of the earlier Rectors, but probability favours the following arrangement. \u2014 Sir Henry Corbett being deceased on April 24, 1288, \u2014 John de Ludham, Priest, was instituted to a Prebendal Portion here.

In 1320 the Bishop (Adam de Orleton) orders the Dean of Pontes bury to notify to the Patron of Westbury47 that the Portions there are void, the Bishop having found on his Visitation that the Por tioners were not in Orders. On February 9th, 1321, the Bishop informs Richard de Ludlow that he can no longer be allowed to hold his Portion ; but if he will go to Rome, the Bishop will ask the Pope to enable him to hold another benefice. The next who occurs is \u2014 Sir Thomas Dobyn, supposed to have been admitted in the time (1317-1327) of Bishop Adam, \"whose Registers were forcibly abstracted and destroyed.\" On March 30, 1348, Dobyn's Portion48 has been presented to \u2014 Henry Tatton, Clerk, \" provided his title were found good.\" Patron, \u2014 the King, as \" Custos of the lands of Laurence de Lud low, who was under forfeiture and outlawry at the suit of John Wyard for trespass.\" On April 21, the King desires that Tatton be admitted.49 On March 19, 1349, Tatton exchanges preferments with \u2014 Roger de Affecote, or Ascot, Rector of the Chapel of Alca- maston. 46 Valor Ecclesiasticus, III. 213. renee, was now in minority. 47 It appears that Sir WiUiam de Wyne was at this time Patron of Westbury.

First, in 1209, we have Richard de Witon, acting as a Surety in a Forest-plea which greatly concerned the Corbets of Caus, and which I have already set forth.2 Soon after we have Simon de Witton (perhaps Richard's Successor) following Roger Burnel as a witness of Robert Corbet's grant of Hulemore to Buildwas Abbey.3 The said Simon and Roger I take to have been joint lords of Whitton. Robert de Wudeton, who has occurred to us in 1221 under cir cumstances favourable to the idea that he was a Corbet Tenant,4 may have been Simon de Witton's successor; and if so, there were two persons named Robert de Wudeton, cotemporary in Shropshire.5 A list of Thomas Corbet's Barony, drawn up about 1240, gives Robert and Roger de Witton as holding one fee in Witton and its 9 Ledger of Salop Abbey, so. 419. 10 Valor Ecclesiasticus, III. 189. 1 Domesday, so. 255, b. -' * 3 Supra, pp. 16, 18. 4 Supra, Vol. VI. p. 124. 5 Supra, Vol. IV. pp. 261-263. 9 VII."], [80, "66 ALBERBURY. appurtenances.6 Roger de Witton's real name I take to have been Burnel, while Robert de Witton is elsewhere called Robert Lowys. Vennington, originally a member of Caus, had apparently been added to Whitton ; otherwise we should be unable to account for so high a service as a whole knight's-fee being chargeable on the latter Manor. In the Ford Hundred-Roll of 1255, Robert de Wylton and Roger Burnel (both Jurors) are said to hold n hides in Wytton of the fee of Caus. They were both liable to geld, and did suit severally to County and Hundred.7 Here the increase of half a hide on the Domesday estimate of Whitton is consistent with the assumed an nexation of Vennington. At the Assizes of 1256, Robert de Wyton and Roger Burnel were again Jurors for Ford Hundred. Their joint tenure of Vennington has been already shown, Robert de Wytton, however, being in that instance called Robert Lowys.8 In 1263 we have had Robert de Wytton and Robert Burnel con secutively named among the Retainers of Thomas Corbet of Caus.9 Possibly for Robert Burnel we should read Roger Burnel.

In the Feodary, drawn up on Thomas Corbet's death in 1274, Robert de Witdon and Roger Burnel appear as Tenants of hah0 a fee each, and the former as owing suit to the Court of Caus. At the Assizes of 1292, Simon Lowys de Wytton was a Juror for Ford Hundred.

Domesday places this Manor in the same category with Alretone (i. e.

In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 5s. ; now it is worth 20s. (per annum).\"1 I cannot suppose that the issues of Reweset Hundred are included in the above valuation, or that those issues were made over to Roger fitz Corbet. Had it been so, we should probably have seen the Barons of Caus as Lords of the Hundred of Ford in the thirteenth century, whereas the said Hundred was in the Crown. Alberbury, though a Manor of small extent and value, though shorn of its ancient dignities as an estate of the Crown and as Caput of a Hundred, and though thought unworthy to be retained even in the demesne of the Barons of Caus, \u2014 Alberbury has a history of surpassing interest to those who would study the principles and the workings of the feudal system. Corbet's first Feoffee in Alberbury seems to have been \u2014 Ralph Crassus, or the fat, who was living in the reign of Stephen. This Ralph Crassus gave the Church of Alberberie to Shrewsbury Abbey. We learn the date of his grant to have been between 1141 and 1155 ; for it is not mentioned in the Empress's Confirmation of 1141, but is clearly recited in Henry II.'s Confir mation of 1155.3 Of Ralph Crassus we hear no more. I have spoken, in a former Volume, of Warin de Metz, of his two elder sons, Roger and Fulk, and of his presumed third son, William. Ro^er, I suppose, was living in 1145, but dead without issue before the accession of Henry II. The earliest extant Pipe- Roll of that King, the Roll of 1156, shows that \u2014 Fulk fitz Warin was then the head of his house. The King had given him the Gloucestershire Manor of Aloestan (Alveston) , previously reputed to yield a blanch ferm of \u00a310. yearly to the Royal Exchequer.3 We know or may presume that Fulk fitz Warin i Domesday, so. 253, b, 1. - Salop Chartulary, No. 40. 2 Salop Chartulary, No. 36. 3 Rot.

He is found in company with, and probably was related to, the Peverels, the staunchest of Legitimatists. Before 1148 the second William Peverel of Dover had given him a Knight's-Fee in Tadlow, Cam bridgeshire ; and Henry II., soon after his succession in 1154, con firmed the gift in form following. \u2014 Henricus Rex Angli\u00e6 (Dux) Normanni\u00e6 et Aquitani\u00e6 et Comes Andegavi\u00e6 Episcopo de Ely, Baronibus, Vicecomitibus, etc. de Cantabrigg' etc. Sciatis me con cessisse Fulconi filio Warini et heredibus suis tenementa sua de Thadesley qu\u00e6 Willelmus Peverel eidem Fulconi dedit pro servicio i feodi militis.

In the same year Fulk fitz Warin was excused a sum of 125., his quota of the donum of Essex and Hert fordshire, and Is., his quota of the donum of Shropshire. In 1165 we find that Fulco fitz Warin had been newly enfeoffed in a knight's fee of the Earl of Gloucester's demesne.5 Possibly this fee was in Tadlow, Cambridgeshire, but my evidence on the point is incon clusive.6 Of Fulk fitz Warin's interests in Shropshire I can only say that, though otherwise favoured by the Crown, his claim upon Whittington seems to have been disregarded by Henry IL, but that he probably held Moston of the Barony of Pulverbatch, Alderton (near Middle) of the Barony of Fitz Alan, and Alberbury and Wel batch of the Barony of Caus. Whether he was in any way heir to Radulf Crassus of Alberbury, or whether he had only succeeded to a lapsed tenure there, I cannot say. The period of his death can be fixed to a year. \u2014 He was living at Michaelmas 1170, when the Gloucestershire Pipe-Roll assigns the Manor of Aloestan to Folcho fitz Warin: he was dead at Michaelmas 1171, when the Gloucester shire Pipe-Roll assigns the same Manor to Fulko, son of Fulko fitz Warin.

Dinan, is stated by Legends to have made a claim upon Ludlow, \u2014 a claim which, as I have before pointed out, was never allowed.7 The Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 1 177 announces that Fulk fitz Warin had been amerced 40 merks by King Henry IL, for forest-trespass. He had paid a part of the debt in 1176 to the Sheriff of Oxford shire. The ultimate balance was paid in 1178 by hand of the Sheriff of Cambridgeshire. The false judgment pronounced by some provincial Court in 1180 against Fulk fitz Warin has already been noticed, and its probable circumstances stated.8 This was the Fulk fitz Warin who disputed the right of Shrewsbury Abbey to the Advowson of Alberbury and gained his point, though not without giving a consideration. The arrangement between the disputants is the subject of two curious Deeds, both of which seem to me to have passed about 1180. \"Fulcho, son of Fulcho fitz Warin, and his heirs, give and concede to Shrewsbury Abbey a virgate and half in the vill of Tadeslawe,9 occupied by dwellers (hospitatam) , and cultivated.

In 1190, we have Fulk fitz Warin fining \u00a3100. with King Richard for his wife's share of her inheritance.12 He paid \u00a320. at once, which shows that the Fine was accepted. In this way, and in right of his wife Hawise, he probably acquired not only a moiety of Lamborn, but that mesne interest in other Wiltshire Manors, such as West bury, Buribluntesdon (Broad Blunsdon), and Stanton, which we afterwards find held by his descendants.13 In 1190, Fulk fitz Warin is assessed 10s. to a Scutage of Wales, and in respect of a knight's-fee in Warwickshire or Leicestershire; but I cannot name his estate in either County. In 1193, I find him paying a Fine of two merks in the Warwickshire Pipe-Roll. On November 6, 1194, Hawise de Dinant names her husband, Fulk fitz Warin, and (Hugh de Plugenai) names his wife, Sibil, as their Attorneys in a suit of mort d'ancestre.1* On November 9 the suit came on for hearing. It appears that they claimed lands at Caleston and Stanton (Wiltshire), against Herbert fitz Herbert and his son Peter. The Court would not entertain the suit till the King, in whose keeping the lands were, had rendered them to the right heirs.16 In this same year (1194) Fulk fitz Warin was assessed 20s. to the Scutage for the King's Redemption, and had fined ten merks to be excused transfretation (to Normandy) . This was probably in respect of his Warwickshire Fee. He had indeed weighty matters to induce his stay in England. \u2014 In 1195 he is entered on the Shropshire Pipe-Roll as owing 40 merks that he may have the Castle of Witinton as it had been adjudged to him in the Curia Regis. He never obtained it, and his Fine remained unliquidated for years.16 The cause will now appear. \u2014 12 Rot. Pipe, 2 Ric. I., WUts. quas Reginaldus filius suus habuit.

In the year ending Michaelmas 1198, Hawise de Dinan fined 30 merks that she might not be obliged to remarry (pro pace habendd ne maritetur) 11 Fulk fitz Warin (II.) was therefore dead. Hawise de Dinan, now a widow, renewed her claim upon Stan ton soon after the accession of King John. About Michaelmas 1199, she and Sibil de Plugenay (now also a widow) fine 60 merks to have trial concerning the vill of Stanton by writ of mort d'an cestre, to wit, as heirs of Joceas de Dinan their father.18 Earlier in the same year I find two tenants in Lamborn refusing to de fend an action, because they were Villains of Hawise de Dinant.19 In 1201, the Berkshire Pipe-Roll (Lamborn having been annexed to that County) gives Sibd, widow of Hugh de Plugenai, and Ha wise, mother of Fulk fitz Warin, as coparceners in Lamburn. In 1204, Hawise de Dinan and her sister Sibil are apparently claim ing, against Oliver de Dinan, estates at Bokeland and Corfton in Somersetshire, and at Hertilande in Devonshire.30 Hawise de Dinan seems to have had part at least of her dower in Alveston. A Writ of King John's, dated August 1, 1214, is in her favour, and relates to some prescriptive right in the Bosc of Alveston.21 I think that Hawise de Dinan was surviving at least as late as the year 1226 ; for that seems to be the earliest limit of a Berkshire Tenure-Roll, which describes her as still holding Lamborn, and makes mention of her father, Joceas de Dinan, and of Fulk fitz Warin, her former husband.22 Fulk fitz Warin (III.), with whom I now proceed, is said in the Fitz- Warin Chronicle to have had four brothers, viz. William, Philip, John and Alan, whereas an authentic document, already quoted, names Ralph, Richard and Warin as sons of Fulk (I.) or Fulk (II.) . Now Fulk (III.) had certainly a brother Alan, who has been seen to follow him, about 1198, in attesting a Charter of Robert Corbet of Caus,23 and we have proof that his brothers William, Phdip, and John (identical with Ivo) were no creations of the Chronicler's imagination. The inference is, that Ralph, Richard, and Warin were sons of Fulk fitz Warin (I.), and brothers of Fulk fitz Warin (II.) In the year ending Michaelmas 1200 (though his father's fine \u00bb Rot.

It is evident that the latter Fine was accepted by the King, and that this was the pro vocation which, in 1201, threw Fulk fitz Warin and his friends into rebellion. The Fitz-Warin Chronicle gives particulars of this outbreak, and of the mode in which Fitz Warin passed the period of his exile and outlawry. As a record of motives, feelings, and manners, the account has its value. As a statement of facts it is of little weight, unless where corroborated by the other evidences which I am about to quote. Fulk fitz Warin was a giant in strength and prowess, but nothing more, if we take the statements of his pane gyrist, who seems however to have been of too coarse a mind to appreciate true chivalry even if it had existed in his hero. The Gloucestershire Pipe Roll of 1201 speaks of Fulk fitz Warin's Manor of Alvestan as an Escheat, the rents thereof (\u00a31. 11s. 8d.) being due to the Crown. I have shown, under Westbury, how Fulk fitz Warin's outlawry was revoked by a Patent of November 15, 1203. Among his inlawed associates I see the names of William fitz Fulk, Philip fitz Guarin, and Ivo fitz Guarin, all perhaps his brothers ; also of Roger de Preston, Henry de Pontesbury, William Malveissin, John and Richard de Preston, Phdip de Hanewude, Hamo de Wikefeld, and Philip de Wemm, all perhaps Shropshire men, and some at least associated with the neighbourhood of Alber bury. It seems that Hawise de Dinan too had been associated in her son's forfeiture, for the Writ which orders the Justiciar of England to restore Fulk's lands, enjoins a similar reinstatement of his Mother.25 In October 1204, Fulk fitz Warin fined 200 merks and two Des triers for possession of the Castle and estate of Whittington as his right and inheritance; and King John, by a Patent of October 17, restored them to him. The Bishop of Norwich undertook to pay the money for Fitz Warin.26 About this time we see Fulk fitz Warin, followed by PhUip his brother, attesting a Deed, given under 24 Rot.

Wilderley.27 I now come to the marriage of Fulk fitz Warin, the circumstances of which are so completely misrepresented in the Fitz- Warin Chronicle, that I must give them with careful minuteness. On June 29, 1205, died Hubert Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury and Chancellor of England. He is said, in the Chronicle, to have negotiated Fulk fitz Warin's marriage, but the facts are these. \u2014 His brother Theobald Walter, -Butler of Ireland, was living in August 1205, but deceased on October 8, 1205. Theobald's widow was Matilda, daughter of Robert le Vavasour,28 to whom King John, on February 19, 1206, made a grant empowering him to take pos session of all his widowed daughter's estates, except Amunderness, and to hold them till Midlent. These estates were the Lady's dower, as widow of Theobald Walter, and her re-marriage was now granted to her Father.29 On July 22, 1207, Matilda le Vavasour was still a Widow, and in her Father's care,30 but before October 1 she had remarried to Fulk fitz Warin ; or, at all events, the said Fulk had replaced Robert le Vavasour as Grantee of her marriage and dower. Fulk and Matilda therefore had King John's precept, 27 Supra, Vol. VI. p. 259. ditary Warden of the Forests of Derby shire and Nottinghamshire. Maud de Caus was wife, first of Adam fitz Peter, Lord of Birkyn, and secondly of Ralph fitz Stephen. By her first husband she had issue John de Bu-kyn, who, on her death in 1224, succeeded to her great in heritance. I think that Roger de Birkyn above-mentioned, and * * * de Bu-kyn wife of Robert le Vavasour, were also chUdren of Maude de Caus by her first husband. 28 Maud le Vavasour was daughter of Robert, granddaughter of WUUam, and sister of John le Vavasour. I think her mother was a daughter of Adam fitz Peter, Lord of Birkyn ; for it appears that \" Ro bert le Vavasour gave his share (it was a fourth) of the VUI of Bolton with Matilda le Count, his daughter, in frank marriage to Theobald Walter, and that the said MatUda afterwards gave it to Boger de Birkyn, her Uncle.\" (SaUay Register, Dugd. MSS. D. 2.) Maud le Vavasour, thus supposed to be her Granddaughter, had two chUdren by her first husband, Theobald Walter. These were Theobald Walter (II.) and MatUda. MatUda was entrusted by King John to the guardianship of Gilbert fitz Reinfrid ; but in 1220 King Henry III. apprises Wil liam de Lancaster (GUbert fitz Reinfrid's son), that Theobald fitz Theobald was now to have charge of his Sister (Pat. 4 Hen. III., m. 5), This Writ, coupled with another of July 1221 (Claus. I. 463), shows that in 1220-1 Theobald Walter (II.) attained his majority. It is not difficult to say why Maud le Vavasour is called Matilda le Count in the above extract. The names Vavasour and Count are treated as equivalent. It is less easy to determine why the Fitz Warin Chronicle caUs the same person Maude de Caus. I, however, suggest an explanation. \u2014 The real Maud de Caus, for there was such a person Uving at the time of Maud le Vavasour's marriage, was probably her Grandmother. She was daughter and sole heir of that Robert de Chauz who figures in 1165 as a great Derbyshire Feudatory (Liber Niger, I. 225), and who was here- *\u00bb Claus.

In 1210 I find Fulk fitz Warin at issue with his Father-in-law about the Yorkshire Manor of Edinton.33 Fitz Warin proffered the King a Fine of \" the best horse in Wales\" for judgment to be hastened in the matter. In this year also he accompanied King John to Ireland, as I learn from several entries of Pr\u0153stita to Fulco f. Guarin at Carrickfergus and at Dublin. His full seizin of Whittington, as recorded in a Roll of 1211, belongs to another page of our history. In September 1212 he accompanied King John on his Northern Journey, and attested his Charters at Allerton and Durham. On April 12, 1213, the King gives him materials out of the Leicestershire Forests wherewith to build at Norborough34 (an estate of his wife's). On April 30, 1213, he was one ofthe Knights then at Winchelsea, and prepared to embark for foreign service. He had a donum on the occasion, of 20 merks.35 On June 27, 1213, he is in King John's Court at Beer Regis (Dorsetshire). In May 1214 he had letters of exemption from the scutage of Poitou, and on June 2 I find him in King John's Court at Roche aux Moins, in Anjou. On December 28, 1214, the King empowers him to take five deer in the Forests of Leicestershire.36 In 1215 I find it stated that Fulk fitz Warin was enfeoffed by Hugh Bigot, in the Berkshire Manor of Wantage. This grant was \" in reward for military services,\" says my autho rity.37 Fitz Warm's heirs afterwards held Wantage under Marshall, Earl of Pembroke.37 Matthew Paris includes Fulk fitz Warin among the malcontent Barons who met at Brackley on April 27, 1215. In due course he appears among the Barons who were excommunicated by Bull of Pope Innocent IIL, on December 16, 1215.38 About Easter 1216 31 Claus, I. 92, b. 32 Rot. Fin. pp. 405-6. 33 Rot.

However, a Writ of June 4, 1221, proves that the King had not permitted Fulk fitz Warin to strengthen Whittington Castle without exacting full se curity for his loyal behaviour.44 A second Writ of November 11, 1222, is urgent upon the Earl of Chester to see that Whittington Castle be not made stronger than was necessary as against the Welsh, or than it was before the Barons' War.45 Before March 1223, Fulk fitz Warin removed all his horses and live-stock from Whittington. Lewellyn, as had been apprehended, laid siege to the Castle, and the King allowed Fitz Warin's cattle to be depas tured in the Lyth Forest.46 Writs of July 11 and October 9, 1223, order the Sheriff to give Fulk fitz Warin full seizin of the Castle and Land of Whittington, and to replace whatever had been taken thence whilst it was in the King's hand.47 About this time we have seen Fulk fitz Warin attesting, as Fulk de Alberbury, a Char ter of his probable relation, Phdip de Burwardsley.48 His con nection with the latter famdy I need not re-discuss.

The suit was a vain one, for the heirs of William Pantulf of Wem were still holding Norborough in the reign of Edward I.62 We further gather from the above Lawsuits, that Maud le Va- vasour was deceased in 1226, otherwise her son would probably have sued her as a joint Defendant with her husband and daughter.

Earl WUUam de New burgh, his son (who died in 1184), gave it t o WUliam le Vavasour, whose son Robert gave it to his daughter MatUda. Hence, in 1221, Fulk fitz Warin (as MatUda's husband) was contesting the Advowson of Norborough with the Abbot of Leicester. Again, MatUda le Vavasour gave Nor borough to Hawyse, her daughter, who took it to WUliam Pantulf of Wem . Their daughter and heir, MatUda, marrying Ralph le Botyler, concurred with her husband, before 1276, in granting Nor borough to their son WUliam and his wife ADkaret. In that year, however, John le Vavasour claimed the Advowson of Norborough, on the ground that in 26 Hen. III. (1241-2) Hawyse fitz Warin (she was then a Widow) had quit-claimed the said Advowson in his favour. ' His opponents, Ralph and Matilda le Botyler, impleaded John le Vavasour for the pre sentation, and deduced their title as above. The writer is showing the* descent of that fourth share of Bolton which Robert le Vavasour had given, in marriage with his daughter, to Theobald Walter. He continues the story thus : \" On Theobald's death, MatUda was married to Fulco fitz Warin ; but Fulk being dead, Matilda, in her widowhood, gave her fourth part of the said viU to Roger de Byrkyn, her uncle (avunculo).\" This testimony is per se as good as, but not better than, that of the Fitz Warin Chronicle. I have, in the text, adhered to the latter, because it seems most con sistent with other independent evidences. However, if the SaUay annaUst should prove to be right, the whole history of the Fitz Warms wUl have to be reconstructed ; for it would at once appear that he who has been represented in my text as Fulk fitz Warin Tertius, was two persons, a father and son ; one the husband of Maud Vavasour, the other of Clarice d'Auber viUe. 53 It is but right to state that the fact 54 Claus.

In Easter Term 1229, I find Fulk fitz Warin not only engaged in the Lawsuit, already described, with Philip de Burwardsley, but suing Peter fitz Herbert for half the Wiltshire Manor of Staun ton.55 In this suit he apparently succeeded, for a later document assigns half a fee, held in capite in Staunton, to Fulk fitz Warin.66 On October 3, 1229, we have Fulk fitz Warin in the King's Court at Westminster.67 On April 20, 1230, he was at Portsmouth, waiting to embark with the King, and had a Patent of Protection for his property, etc., during his absence in foreign parts. On February 4, 1233, he fined 600 merks for custody of the heirs and lands of Wdliam Pantulf, then deceased.58 On May 15, 1234, the King desires Fulk and Alan fitz Garin each to supply one Knight for foreign service, and in aid of the Earl of Bretagne.59 On July 26, 1236, Fulk fitz Warin in North Wales, and WiUiam fitz Warin in South Wales, are appointed Dictators, that is, standing Arbitrators, of the truce then existing between King Henry and Lewellyn.60 In 1237, an entry on the Shropshire Pipe-Roll shows Fulk fitz Warin as responsible for a claim of the Crown on the Barony of Wem, viz. 16 merks for the King's year and waste of the land of Roger de Culshis (an outlaw). Fitz Warin's Sureties were his neighbours, viz. Richard Corbet and Adam de Arundel.61 On 1V1 arch 8, 1238, Fulk fitz Warin was one of the great chiefs summoned to Oxford to consult with the King as to the threatening attitude assumed by Lewellyn, who had caused his son David to re ceive the homage of the Magnates of North Wales and Powys.61 In or about 1240, a Feodary of Thomas Corbet's Barony gives Fulk fitz Warin as holding one knight's-fee thereof in Aldeburi?2 It appears that while Fulk fitz Warin had had custody of Pan tulf's Barony, he had enfeoffed Ralph de Hodnet in the escheated land of Roger de Culshis (or de Cuneshasel, as he is in this instance called). In 1243-4 Matilda (Pantulf ) and her husband, Ralph le Botyler, questioning the legality of this, sued Ralph de Hodnet for the land. The latter called Fulk fitz Warin to warranty. I mention this here because Ralph de Hodnet occurs in other affairs 55 Placita, Pasch. Tm. 13 Hen.

The Nuncio obeyed the order. On July 5, 1245, Fulk fitz Warin stands first witness to a Charter of Henry III.'s at Windsor.66 On Nov. 6, 1245, the King, by a Patent dated at Lilleshall, orders Fulk fitz Warin, John le Strange, and Henry de Audley to put an end to a quarrel, about land in Dendover, between Griffin ap Madoc, Griffin ap Wenhunwen, and Roger de Montalt. From this period to the period at which I have reason to suppose that Fulk fitz Warin died, is about twelve years. It is curious that the Fitz Warin Chronicle, growing more accurate at its close, states him to have been blind the last seven years of his life. I can find him in no public employment during this supposed period, and yet I think that I can show him to have been living for a great part thereof. On November 22, 1248, a Fine was levied between Thomas Corbet (Plaintiff) and Fulk fitz Warin (Deforciant), concerning the customs and service required by Corbet on a Knight' s-fee held by Fitz Warin in Alberbury. Corbet required that Fitz Warin should do him the homage and service of one knight, and do suit every three weeks at the Court of Caus, and find one knight or two servientes for ward of Caus Castle at his (Fitz Warin' s) cost, for 40 days, whenever there was war between the English King and represents Fulk fitz Warin as surviving Lewellyn ap Jorweth many years, and the latter we know died in 1240. 64 Originalia, I. 5. 65 M. Paris, I. 659. Mr. Wright, in his Introduction to the Fitz Warin Chro nicle, supposes this Fulk fitz Warin to have been Fulk, junior.

IIL, m. 3. 63 The Fitz Warin Chronicle, in one place (p. 61), bears an appearance of having been composed in the lifetime of Walter de Lacy, i.e. before 1241, and yet it speaks fuUy of the death of Fulk fitz Warin, which we might thus conclude to have taken place before that of Walter de Lacy. However, it is plain that the Chronicle is not the work of one time or hand, for the writer of the latter part (pp. 177-183)"], [93, "79 ALBERBURY. the Welsh. Fitz Warin now acknowledged all these obligations, and Corbet in return remitted all damages which he affirmed him self to have suffered by the withholding of these services, down to the date of this concord. I suppose that a Fine of five merks pro licentid concordandi, charged against Fulk fitz Warin in the Pipe-Roll of 1\u00a350 and unliquidated in 1252, was an incident of the above Concord. In October 1250, Fulco fitz Warin and Clarice, his wife, fine one merk for a Writ in a Kentish Lawsuit.67 Here we have un doubtedly the Clarice de Auberville of the Fitz AYarin Legend, and some proof that the Fulk fitz Warin of 1201 was still living. In another year the last fact is still apparent. The Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 1251 records an amercement of one merk against Fulk fitz Warin, for not producing one for whom he was bound (quia non habuit) ; but the Chancellor's Antigraph of the said Roll records this same amercement against Fulk fitz Warin, junior. The Pipe- Roll again records an amercement of 20 merks against Fulk fitz Warin for venison trespass (pro trangressione venacionis). Here we have un questionably, not the man of more than 70 years of age, blind if alive, but his son, aged perhaps about 40. A Record of the next year places, I think, the practical succession of \u2014 Fulk fitz Warin (IV.) beyond a doubt, though perhaps his Father was still alive. In August 1252, Fulco, son of Fulco fitz Warin, fines one merk to have a Writ relevant to some Wiltshire Lawsuit.68 Surely too the Fulk fitz Warin, who in September 1253 has a Patent of Protection, so long as he should be in the King's service in Gascony, was Fulk fitz Warin (IV.) . The Ford Hundred- Roll of 1255 shows that, if Fulk fitz Warin (III.) w-ere living, he was not in possession of Alberbury. It says that \" Fulk fitz Warin holds two hides, geldable, in Albeburi, of the fee of Caus, and does suit to County and Hundred.\" It also says (in another place) that \" the Grandemontensian Brethren hold two virgates (part, I presume, of the above two hides) in Alberburi by \u25a0rift of Fulk fitz Warin, senior, and of the Fee of Caus.\"69 I shall show hereafter that it was Fulk fitz Warin (III.), whether blind, imbecile, or dead in 1255, who founded and endowed the Grand montensian Priory of Alberbury. As to Alberbury being now two hides whereas it was only one in Domesday, that is an unusual change. Possibly Bausley, which stood as an independent Manor 67 \u2022 <* Rot. Fin., II. 89, 138. I 69 Rot. hundred. II. 66."], [94, "80 ALBERBURY. of one hide in Domesday, was on the present occasion reckoned as an appurtenance of Alberbury. I have alluded under Caus to a Patent of July 5, 1255, which appointed Henry de Mara, Geoflrey de Langley, and William de Wilton, as Justices to set to rights injuries and strifes which sub sisted between Thomas Corbet and Griffin ap Wenhunwin. A meet ing of course took place on this subject ; and, by a strange chance, another Record tells us of something, very material to our present discussion, which probably took place at that meeting. We have indeed all but an absolute proof that at the time of that meeting Fulk fitz Warin (III.) was still alive, but that Fulk fitz Warin (IV.) represented him absolutely, as Corbet's Vassal. The Record to which I allude is an entry on the Salop Assize-Roll of January 1256.70 It runs as follows. \u2014 \" An Assize comes on, to make recognition whether Thomas Cor bet hath disseized Fulk fitz Warin, junior, of his free tenement in Albebyr, viz. of about 120 acres.\" \" Thomas says that the land is of his Fief, and that the Plaintiff, before many Magnates and Lieges of the King, rendered back his homage and the said land to the Defendant, and positively declared that he never would hold either that or any other land of the De fendant. For this reason the Defendant put himself in seizin of the said land, as it was lawful for him to do, the moment that Fulk abandoned it (wayviavit) to him.\" \"Fulk says (in reply) that he never rendered back land nor homage, and asks judgment on this special point, \u2014 whether, even if it were true that under anger and excitement he had verbally ren dered back his homage, yet had not subsequently changed his state, but had continuously remained in seizin, \u2014 whether it was competent to the Defendant to disseize him on the ground of a mere word. As to his never having, spontaneously, and of goodwill, surrendered the land, he puts himself on an Assize \" (i. e. appeals to a Jury) . \"The Jury declares that a certain day of reconciliation (dies amoris) was fixed upon between Thomas Corbet and Griffin ap Wen nonwyn, touching several matters of contention ; \u2014 that many Mag nates met together on the occasion, and that Fulk, the present Plaintiff, was of the number; \u2014 that Fulk and Thomas Corbet quarrelled together (corrixati sunt) \u2022\u2014 that Corbet called Fulk, Fulk' s father, a Traitor (Proditorem) ; \u2014 that Fulk announced (man davit) to Corbet, that, seeing he charged his father with such a 70 Assizes, 40 Hen.

The Feudal System, with its exigencies as to homage and personal fealty, is before us. The sound equity of the Curia Regis, already inclining to soften rather than enforce the asperities of that system, is apparent. We have Thomas Corbet in his usual character, \u2014 quarrelsome, crafty and vindictive ; \u2014 the foe of his own relations and his own vassals. We have a Strange, pleased doubtless to bear a defiant message to the enemy of his family. We have Fulk fitz Warin (III.), too aged and too infirm to manage his own affairs, but reproached, nevertheless, with his past irregularities. Lastly, we have his son, as plain-spoken, as reckless, and withal as successful as the father. it seems that Thomas Corbet was not satisfied with the judgment in favour of Fitz Warin. He took the ordinary means to upset it. In such cases, if an Appellant questioned the plain verdict of a Jury, his course was to get a Writ of Attaint against that Jury. If, on the other hand, he thought that a false judgment had resulted 71 On foho 66-b of the Sloane MS, 1301, we have a Deed quoted, and perhaps misquoted, whereby \"Fulk fitz Warin, Lord of Wytington,\" is stated to have given \"a Release of aU actions to Sir Thomas Corbett, on Sunday after the Epiphany, 40 Henry III.\" This date is equivalent to Sunday, January 9, 1256 ; \u2014 just five days before the Justices-in-Eyre commenced their sittings in Shrewsbury. ment, the accuracy of which I altogether doubt. It is impossible to reconcUe it with the facts stated at the Trial. More over the Transcriber notes that the Seal thereof was Two Ravens. The inference is that it was a Deed of Thomas Cor bett, not of Fulk fitz Warin. Possibly, however, it was the Counterpart of some Indenture which involved an act of each party ; and so was interchangeably sealed. I wUl not attempt to explain a docu- U VII."], [96, "82 ALBERBURY. from an insufficient examination of the Jury, and that other points might be raised, his course was to obtain a Writ of Certification. In the present instance Corbet appropriately took the latter course. The process of Certificatio was to resummon the Jury to another Court, where they gave evidence as to what passed at the former Trial, and where also it was necessary that the successful Litigant should be in attendance to hear the proceedings. Thus in Hdary Term 1259, Thomas Corbet appeared (by his Attorney) at West minster, versus Fulk fitz Warin ; \u2014 \" to the end that the latter should come into Court and hear Certification of an Assize of novel disseizin, taken before Simon de Wauton and his fellows, between the said Fulk (Plaintiff) and the said Thomas, concerning a tene ment in Alberbur'.\" Fulk however appeared not, and the cause was adjourned to Easter Term following.72 Not till Easter Term 1260 do I find further notice of this Appeal. Then the difficulty was the non-attendance of the Jurors, or some of them. Their names are given. The Sheriff had been ordered to compel by distraint the appearance of Odo de Hodnet, William de Leighton, Stephen de Buterlegh, and Peter de Muneton ; also of Reginald Bardulf, William de Hulkinton, Henry de Wodenton, William de Weston and Thomas de Legh, notwithstanding their residence in the Honour of Montgomery and Chirbury. Stephen de Buterlegh and William de Leighton now appeared at West minster. It was stated, in respect of some of the persons named, that they were not on the Jury in question, and that Peter de Moneton was dead. William de Hulkinton, Henry de Wodenton and William de Weston were reported by the Sheriff to have found Manucaptors (for their future appearance, I suppose). The Court ordered the Sheriff to ascertain who the other Jurors were.78 In the troubled period which was now approaching I find no re currence of this matter. On August 1, 1260, Fulk fitz Warin is included in the great military summons against Lewellyn, return able at Shrewsbury, cum equis et armis, on Sept. 8 following. Fulk fitz Warin (III.) was probably now dead, or his son would have been still called Junior, as at the commencement of the above lawsuit. It is remarkable that Fulk fitz Warin (III.) left two sons named Fulk, one, that Fulk (IV.) of whom I have been speaking, and one who was afterwards called Fulk fitz Warin of Alberbury, for reasons which will appear presently. In 1262 these \u00ab Placita, HU. Tm. 43 Hen. IIL, m. I 19. Simon de Wauton, John Abbot of I Peterborough, etc., were the Justices-in- I Eyre at Shrewsbury in 1256. ?3 Plac. apud West., 44 Hen.

At the Forest Assizes of February 1262, Sir Fulk fitz Warin Senior was reported as having taken a brocket-deer (brokettum cervi\u2122) on Sept. 25, 1257. The term senior is, I pre sume, relevant to the year of the Assize, not to that of the trespass. I have cited under Caus a letter of Henry III.'s, dated July 22, 1262, which seems to recognise Fulk fitz Warin's importance on the Marches.75 A Patent of January 1263, accords him the usual protection while acting for the King in the parts of Wales. Whether in consequence of his feuds with the Baron of Caus, or out of mere fraternal affection, it is clear that about this time he conveyed Alberbury (except the Advowson of the Church and Abbey, and except the Walcheria pertaining to the Manor) to his younger brother, thenceforth called Fulk fitz Warin of Alberbury, or distinguished from the elder line in some other way. The con ditions of this transfer were subjects of after litigation and will recur again to our notice. On May 14, 1264, Fulk fitz Warin (IV.) fell on the Royalist side in that great misfortune of Lewes, not as be came a Fitz Warin, in the thickest of the fight, but drowned in the adjacent river.76 He left behind him a widow, Constance, and a son \u2014 Fulk fitz Warin (V.), who seems not to have attained his ma jority till 1273, when Livery was allowed him of his Berkshire estates.77 I should state that in October 1272, Fulk fitz Warin (V.) was in custody of Hamo le Strange, and Robert le Strange his bro ther; but Thomas Corbet had for some time been suing those per sons for this wardship, on the ground that Fitz Warin held under the Plaintiff per servicium militare. The Sheriff was ordered to compel the appearance of the two Defendants who had already made frequent defaults ; but the result does not appear.78 The Feodary drawn up on Thomas Corbet's death in 1274, gives Fulk fitz Warin as Tenant of one Knight's-fee in the Barony of the deceased. I shall here cease to make the elder line of Fitz Warin the prominent sub ject of my remarks. Bausley and AAThittington will be more appro priate localities for a continuation of their history. As we are now speaking of Alberbury, we must trace the career of its possessor, viz. \u2014 74 The brocket was a two-year-old deer. 7\u00bb Supra, p. 27. 77 Originalia, I. 19. 78 Assizes, 56 Hen.

He too was a Royalist, and it is a Pseudo-Patent of December 20, 1264, which commands Fulk fitz Warin, Junior, to surrender Whittington Castle (late Fulk fitz Warin's) to Peter de Montfort. Of course no such surrender was made, and a Patent of January 12, 1266, gives toFulk fitz Warin, Junior, for his meritorious services, custody of a carucate of land in Staunton (Wiltshire), which had belonged to Fulk fitz Warin deceased, and which the Patentee was to retain till the heir of the said deceased should attain his lawful age. It was subsequently found that this carucate had already been assigned as part of the dower of Constance, Widow of Fulk fitz Warin, Senior, so a Patent of April 16, 1266, promises to Fulk fitz Warin, Junior, wardships or escheats, to the annual value of \u00a310., in lieu thereof. In Michaelmas Term following I find the said Constance suing the Tenant of Staunton (Berkshire) for dower ; and on January 20, 1267, she sues Fulk de Leyham for one-third of the Manor of Auberbyr'. The suit does not recur, nor have I any reason to show why Fulk fitz Warin, evidently the Defendant, was called de Leyham. Sir Fulk fitz Warin, who sat as foreman of the Jury in the Inquest of Ford Hundred, taken November 27, 1274, was evidently of Alberbury. He complained that Thomas Corbet (he was now dead) had caused his cattle to be attached, viz. 9 oxen, 1 mare (jumentum), 8 she-goats, and 21 swine, and that William Hager, Corbet's Clerk, still detained the same, in defiance of a man date of the King's.79 Again, Sir Fulk fitz Warin was one of four knights who about March 1276 sat on the Inquest after the death of John le Strange. One William de Alberbury was also a Juror on this occasion. On June 16, 1284, King Edward I., at the instance of Bogo de Knovill, then at Court, granted a Charter of Free-Warren to Fulk fitz Warin of Alberbury ; \u2014 also license for a weekly market to be held there on Fridays, and for two annual fairs of three days each, viz. June 15, 16, and 17, and September 28, 29, and 30. A Deed of Richard, Earl of Arundel, which passed at Shrawar dine Castle, apparently on March 25, 1292, is here noticeable for some of the names contained in its testing clause.81 These are Peter Corbet, Fulk fitz Warin, Robert Corbet, and Fulk Glas, all knights. The second witness is clearly Fulk fitz Warin (V.) of Whittington 79 Rot. Hundred. II. 96. i 80 Rot. Chart. 12 Edw.

At the Assizes of October 1292 these two had a Law suit which quite explains their relative positions. \u2014 \" Fulk fitz Warin of Alberburi is summoned to answer Fulk fitz Warin of Wytinton, who seeks to make him keep to a Convention, formerly made be tween Fulk the Plaintiff's Father (whose heir the Plaintiff is) and Fulk fitz Warin of Alberburi (the present Defendant).\" This con vention (as the Plaintiff stated) concerned the Manor of Alberburi, except the Advowson of the Abbey and Church, and except the Walcheria pertaining to the Manor ; and the Plaintiff's grievance was that, whereas Fulk fitz Warin of Whittington delivered the said Manor to the Defendant, to hold till Fulk of Whittington should give him 10 librates of land in Anglecheria; \u2014 and whereas such quantity of land had repeatedly been offered to the Defendant in Wanetynge, Berkshire; \u2014 yet the Defendant had refused and still was refusing to abide by the Convention. In proof hereof the Plaintiff produced the said Convention, which ran as follows: \u2014 Ego Fulco filius Warini, Junior, recepi de Domino Fulcone fratre meo manerium de Alberburi exceptis (etc. etc., as described in the above Plea).83 To all this Fulk fitz Warin of Alberburi now replied that Fulk fitz Warin, his brother, and the Plaintiff's father, had given him (the Defendant) the Manor of Alberburi simply and unconditionally ; and of the truth of this he vouched a Charter. The cause was ad journed to Lichfield, and I trace it no further. It is clear to me that Fulk fitz Warin (IV.) had at different times given a conditional and an unconditional grant of Alberbury to his brother, and that a counterpart only of the former had reached his son and heir. That Fulk Glas retained Alberbury is apparent. At these very Assizes, and described as Fulco de Alberbur', he chose the Jury for Ford Hundred, and he has occurred to us, similarly designated, in the attestation of a Habberley Deed of this period. Before the year 1311 Fulk Glas (I.) had been succeeded by his son \u2014 Fulk Glas (II.) . On February 9 of that year a Fine was levied whereby Master John de Cherleton (evidently a Feoffee in trust) settles the Manor of Alberbury on Fulk, son of Fulk Glaas, and Agnes his wife, and the heirs of their bodies, with remainder to the right heirs of Fulk.83 It was Fulco Glas (II.) who in 1316 was returned as Lord of 82 Assizes, 20 Edw.

The Church was still Collegiate when Ralph Crassus, in the time of Stephen, gave it to Shrewsbury Abbey, and when that Abbey, in the time of Henry IL, surrendered it to the second Fulk fitz Warin. Alberbury is said, on the best authority, to have been sometime an Escheat, and in the hands of Robert Corbet of Caus. This was probably from 1201 to 1203, the period of the outlawry of Fulk fitz Warin (III.). If so, it was then that Robert Corbet conferred two Prebends in this Church on William and Hugh Corbet. Of how many, if of any more, Prebends, the College consisted, I cannot say. The Fitz Warins were doubtless the rightful Patrons of all. When on June 25, 1227, King Henry III., giving a general Confirmation to Shrewsbury Abbey, includes the Church of Alberbury,86 the expres sion must be taken as a mere matter of routine, a literal but no longer truthful repetition of what had been contained in the confir mation of Henry II.

On April 13, 1262, Thomas Corbet (of Caus) quit-claimed to the Friars of Alberbury any right or claim which he had, or might have, to the Advowson of those two Prebends in Alberbury Church, to which Robert Corbet, his Father, had pre sented when the land of Alberbury was his Escheat.87 The Friars evidently procured an appropriation of this Church, and thus the Prebends were suppressed, and a Vicarage only remained. Of this Vicarage the said Friars were of course Patrons. In case of a pre sentation dated May 1284, the Vicarage is stated to be worth 15 merks, but Bishop Swinfield, on instituting the Presentee, reserved to himself a power of augmenting that stipend out of the Rectorial Funds. I have spoken on a former page of a decision between the Prior of Alberbury and the Incumbents of Welsh- Pool relative to the tithes of Bausley and thirteen other Vills in the district of Gor dowr.88 The dispute had originally been, not so much about tithes and parochial boundaries, as about the limits of the Dioceses of Hereford and St. Asaph. I suppose that during the Border wars of Henry III.'s time, the two Lewellyns had so far been successful as to have encroached upon, or at least made debatable, a large tract of Country, East of the Severn. Anian IL, Bishop of St. Asaph (1268-1293), seems to have taken advantage of this state of things, by arrogating to his own Diocese portions of the Parishes of Alberbury, Worthen, and Chirbury. The controversy had begun while Cantilupe was Bishop of Hereford (1275-82). At that Pre late's decease it was before the Papal Court, and had since been re ferred back to competent judges on the spot. A Jury of Welsh and English had at length been assembled to decide the boundary of the two Dioceses of Anian (II.) and Richard Swinfield, now Bishop of Hereford. The award was in favour of Hereford. The Perambulation took place on Nov. 23, 1288, when the true and ancient boundary of the Dioceses was determined to be the filum, or midstream, of the Severn, from the ford called Rhydwymma, where the river divided the lands of Sir Reginald de Montgomery from those of Peter Corbet, to the ford of Shrawarden. On the morrow Swinfield came to Chir bury, and on the 25th (St. Catherine's day) he entered on horseback the ford of Rhydwymma, to the middle of the river, and thus took possession of all places and Vills within the bank assigned to him, 8?

The Clergy of the different Parishes tendered their obedience, and thus ended a dis pute which had lasted for ten years. The settlement, notwithstand ing a subsequent effort of Bishop Anian, to disturb it, governs the question of boundary between these two Dioceses at this very day.89 In May 1289 Swinfield settled a dispute between the Prior of Alberbury and Gregory de Clun, the Vicar of the Church. The Vicar had served the Church, with its Chapels, and that of Wool aston, four years, for an emolument of ten merks, and had been engaged in a continuous dispute with his Patrons. Swinfield now decided that the costs of visitations, repairs of chancels, books, vest ments, and vessels, as well as all extraordinary charges, should be borne equally by the Vicar and the Friars. The vicar was to pro vide suitable lights for the Church, to collect the Peter-pence of the Parish, and pay them to the Archdeacon, with 12c.. for Synodals. He was also to pay 6s. 8d. yearly to the Prior, in token of subjection, and for the boon of peace (pro bono pads)?0 The Bishop awarded to the Vicar the hay-tithes of Woolaston, the offerings of the Altar, and all small tithes, except those of wool and lamb. The latter, with all Mortuaries and Heriots, were to remain to the Priory.91 On May 4, 1290, Bishop Swinfield, in course of his Visitation, consecrated the Parish Church of Alberbury. Here it is evident that a distinction is marked between the Parochial and Conventual Churches, and that the former, for some reason or other, had to be reconsecrated. The Bishop and his Suite were entertained that day by the Prior of Alberbury. On May 5 (Friday) hay and corn for the thirty-six horses of the Bishop's Suite were provided by the Prior, but the other expenses of the day were charged against the Bishop by his Secretary. The purchase of Salmon, fresh-water fish, and eels, is appropriate not only to the cm-rent fast-day, but to a locality so near the Severn.92 The Church of Alberbury, I should observe, like that of Chirbury, consecrated three days later, was dedicated to St. Michael. The Warrior-Saint was perhaps selected under some association with the history of a district which had now for two centuries been the nursery and the grave of ever-warring Chieftains. 89 For most of these detaUs I am in debted to the Abstract appended to Swin field's Household-RoU, by its accurate and learned Editor (pp. lxxviu. <_. lxxix.). 90 Abstract (ut supra), pp. cxcu. cxciu. 91 MS. at Loton Park. 92 Swinfield's Household RoU, p. 81."], [105, "89 THE CHURCH. The Ecclesiastical Taxation of 1291 values the Church of Alber bury, in Pontesbury Deanery, at \u00a325. per annum. This was the Rectorial Income. The \"Vicar's Portion\" in the same Church was put at \u00a36. 13s. 4d. per annum?3 The Assize-Roll of 1292 gives an instance of the respect which the English Borderers paid to Churches, as Sanctuaries even for enemies. A Murderer, a Welshman, had (probably ten years before) taken Sanctuary in Alberbury Church. He had remained there five weeks, till \" in time of war\" he was released by his compatriots. The names of him and his rescuers were not known to the Ford Jurors who made this presentment. Sentence of outlawry was nevertheless recorded.95 The Rector of Diddlebury had a further Portion of \u00a31. 6s. 8d. here.91 This I take it was an onus laid on the Church of Alberbury by the Dignitaries of Hereford, when they allowed the Appropriation of Alberbury. Diddlebury was their own Church. In 1341 the assessment of Alberbury Parish to the Ninth accu rately quotes the Church Taxation as being \u00a333. This sum the Assessors reduced to a parochial tax of \u00a310. 4s. Their reasons for so great a reduction seem to have been these. \u2014 (1.) The greater portion of the Parish was in the parts of Wales. (2.) The Prior of New-Abbey, as Rector of the said Church, held three carucates of land, worth 50s. per annum, as his glebe. (3.) A certain portion of the said Parish, worth 20s. per annum, pertained to the Church of Andelbury (the pension of \u00a31. 6s. 8d. to Diddlebury is meant). (4.) Three virgates of land, in two Vills of the said Parish, were untilled, through the poverty of the Occupants.96 The Valor of 1534-5 gives the preferment of John Poole, Vicar of Alberbury, as \u00a35. in glebe and tithes, less Is. for Archdeacon's Synodals, and 13s. 4d. for Bishop's Procurations. The same Record values the Chapel of Alberbury, of which the Master and Fellows of All Souls' College, Oxford, were Proprietaries, at \u00a35. per annum, in tithes of corn and hay, paid by diverse persons.\"97 By this, I pre sume, is meant an endowed Chapel within the precinct of the long previously suppressed Priory.

Walter Pryde was presented to this Vicarage by Patent of December 6, 1337, the King being Patron, as having in hand the Temporalities of the Abbey of Grammont and of New Abbey.98 In 1340, Pryde proposing to exchange preferments with \u2014 Richard le Spenser, Parson of the Chapel of Eton Constantine, the latter is presented to Alberbury by a Patent of June 8th, the King being Patron as before,99 but it is not probable that Spenser was instituted, for a Patent of August 28, 1341, sanctions Pryde's exchange of Alberbury for the preferment of \u2014 Thomas le Wolf, late Parson of Habberley.1 A Patent of April 12, 1347, nominates \u2014 John de Ireland, of Aston, Chaplain, to this Vicarage.2 An other of September 15, 1349, nominates \u2014 David de Wyke, Chaplain,3 and another of January 23, 1350, nominates \u2014 Richard de Burghton, Chaplain.4 Meanwhile, on August 8, 1349, the Bishop of Hereford had admitted \u2014 Sir Thomas de Cherynton, Priest, at the presentation of the Prior and Convent of the New Abbey. Again, on September 17, 1349, the Bishop had instituted \u2014 Richard de Burghton on a like presentation, in which it seems that the King afterwards acquiesced. The truth is, that there was a protracted contest between the Crown and the Priory about the right of presentation. By a letter, dated July 30, 1356, the King informs the Bishop of Hereford that the Crown had recovered the said right against the Prior of the New Abbey, by reason of the war with France. The dispute was not about the Presentee, but about the right to present, for the King only reiterates the previous nomi nations of Richard de Burton to the Vicarage.

On November 3, 1371 \u2014 Richard Breed was nominated Vicar by the King, as having the Temporalities of the New Monastery in his hands; but this must have been cancelled, for on October 12, 1372, the King con firms Thomas de Monford's title.

SUfcetfmrp This foundation has had various names, such as New Monastery , White Monastery, and New Place. It has also, and with little propriety, been called the White Abbey, the Black Abbey? and the New Abbey. It was never an Abbey in any sense whatever. As many mistakes have been made about its Founder and the date of its Foundation as about its name. A misconstruction of Leland ascribes the Foundation to Guarine, Sheriff of Shropshire? which would imply a date previous to Domesday. Tanner says it was founded in the time of Henry I., and Dugdale, in ascribing the foundation to Guarine de Metz, would seem to have paved the way for that error. The Editors of the New Monasticon, rightly ascribing the foundation to Fulk, the son of Guarine (or Fulk fitz Warin), wrongly conclude from this that Henry II.'s reign was the date thereof.7 it makes Guarine to have been founder of Alberbury Abbey. It does not howeyer represent him as Sheriff, but only as An cestor of the Fitz Warins. Of course Warin, de Metz is the person alluded to by the Chronicler, and the title of Sheriff is a mistake of the Monasticon Editors. 5 White, from the colour of the budd ing, which was of stone (see Hist.

The French Chronicle of Fitzwarin adumbrates the truth in the following passage, descriptive of the conduct of Fulk fitz Warin the former Outlaw,\u2014 him whom we know to have been in reality the third Fulk fitz Warin of his line.\u2014\" Fulk \" (on his return home from an alleged campaign in Ireland) \" bethought him that he had greatly sinned against God, as by slaughter of people and other great offences; and, in remission of his sins, founded a Priory in the honour of our Lady, St. Mary, of the order of Grandmont, near Alberbury, in a wood, on the river Severn ; and it is called the New Abbey. And not long after died dame Maude de Cause, his wife, and was interred in this Priory.\"8 Now we have some proof that the Lady, here called Maude de Cause, was deceased in 1226. According to this evidence we may therefore place the Foundation of Alberbury Priory about the year 1220. There is another story, to the effect that \" Fulk fitz Warin, after founding this Grandimontensian Priory, granted the custody and visitation thereof to the Abbot and Convent of Lilleshall, but that they, finding the right burdensome and expensive, solemnly re signed it into his hands, that he might, with consent of his Diocesan, commit it to any Religious House at his pleasure.\" This story has probably a germ of truth; \u2014 not that the Augustine Canons of Lilleshall ever could or did accept the custody of a House of Benedictine Friars; but that Fulk fitz Warin, failing to affiliate his nascent Monastery on Lilleshall Abbey, sought other patron age, and at length fixed on that of the French House of Grandmont, in Limousin. The Order of Grandmont had its origin at Grandmont about a.d. 1076. The Monks or Friars adopted the Rule of St. Benedict. They had three subject Priories in England, viz. Grosmont in York shire, founded in the reign of John ; Cresswell, in Herefordshire, founded early in the reign of Henry III. ; and Alberbury, pro bably coeval with the last. In calculating the date of this Priory's Foundation we have still another kind of evidence, that of its own Charters. It is true that the foundation-charter is not known to exist, nor can I trace its former existence, unless a Charter, whereby Fulk fitz Warin is said to have \"expressly subjected Alberbury to the Abbey of Grand mont,\" were the actual foundation-charter. But we have two Con firmations to this House, one by Henry III., dated at Hereford, 8 Fitz Warine Chronicle (T. Wright), pp. 176, 177."], [109, "93 ALBERBURY PRIORY. December 12, 1232, the other by Pope Gregory IX., dated at Anaguia, February 5, 1233. Of Fulk fitz Warin's own Charters two only are known to exist in any form. They both seem to have been supplementary to the foundation, and one certainly passed later than the Confirmation of Henry III. I may now state my conviction that Alberbury Priory was founded between 1220 and 1230, and proceed with the contents of its Charters. \u2014 Henry III.'s Charter (as printed) confirms to the Brethren of Grandimontensian Order at Abberburi super Avenam (read Sab rinam) the place where their House is founded at Abberbury, which (place) they have of the gift of Fulco fitz Warin; also (confirms) the meadow of Bradmed, and the land of Hekenhal, and 24 acres of land in Abberbury, and husbot and haybot, and wood for the Brethren's hearth, to be taken there, in the bosc of the said Fulco, and common-pasture in said Fulco's bosc for all sorts of animals, and quittance of pania^ge for a hundred swine in Fulco's woods of Abberbury and Witinton, when there is any pesson, and tithe of Fulco's horses at Witinton, and (leave) to get marl, wherever they may find it on Fulco's land, and where Fulco and his men may have got it, or may be reasonably able to get it, and to draw the same on to their own land, with free ingress and egress, and quittance from toll and all customs, at all Fulco's markets and fairs ; and all the land of Wateburg,9 with the Mill and Bosc and other its appur tenances ; all which things the Brethren aforesaid have by gift and concession of the said Fulco fitz Warin. Among the witnesses to this Charter, which as I have said passed at Hereford on December 12, 1232, are William de Stutevill, Walter de Clifford, Wdliam de Cantilupe, Senior, and Thomas Corbeth;\u2014 all persons connected with Shropshire. Pope Gregory's Bull is addressed to the Prior and Brethren of Abberburi, of Grandimontensian Order, and of Hereford Diocese. It merely confirms their \"possessions, rents and goods, as they justly and peaceably had them,\" without enumerating any lands or the names of any Benefactors.10 Of one of Fulk fitz Warin's own Charters I have only a descrip- in a former instance (p. 74, note). If so, Fulk fitz Warin got his interest there with his wife, Maud Vavasour. 10 Weever's Funeral Monuments, p. 141. 9 This is Whatbergh in Leicestershire, where the Prior of Alberbury had lands held of the Honour of Huntingdon (Bur ton's Leicestershire, p. 302).

It is attested (inter alios) by William de Hodenet; Randolph de Hodnet; and Randolph, Rector of Wytinton, \u2014 names which furnish no proximate date for the Deed. The years 1225 and 1255 are however its probable limits. The Charter of Fulk fitz Warin I have in a fuller, but very inac curate, form. \" Fulk fitz Warin,\" as I understand the document, \" by consent of Fulk, his son. and heir, and for the soul's health of Maud his wife, Fulk his father, and Hawyse his mother, gave (and confirmed) to the Brethren of Alberbury, of Grandemont Order, for the promotion of their houses (buildings) all (previous) gifts and sales in Pemenhull (Pimhill), Alberbury, and Halisley. Wit nesses, \u2014 Sir William de Hodenet; Sir M. Mehell; Sir Ramund of Alberbury; Sir Ralph le Butiler; Sir P. Peverell; Sir W. de St. George ; Sir Ramun (probably Radulf) de Hodenett ; Sir Hamon de Felton.\"12 It would be unwise to descant too much on a document so metamorphosed as this is. Suffice it then to say that the attestation of Sir Ralph le Botiler and others would indicate a late period in the Grantor's life, and that the lands granted were granted at a later period than 1232, the date of Henry III.'s Charter. The MS. which supplies the last Deed gives an abstract of another Deed, whereby \" Thomas Corbet \" is said \" to have confirmed Sir Fulk fitz Warin's grant to the Freres of Graundmont of his Church of Alberbury.\"13 This confirmation is distinguished as having been sealed with \" two Ravens \" (a circumstantial proof of its authen ticity), and having been dated in the year 1362 (a positive proof of its falsity, unless we are permitted to supply the date 1262 as a conjectural emendation). Again, I learn from a MS. authority, credible enough, though unvouched by Deeds, that \" Fulk fitz Warin (the founder of Alber bury) gave his body to the Priory to be buried there ; and that therewith he gave a certain messuage in Wytmere, in pure and perpetual alms.''1*1 The date of this grant must needs have been after the middle of the thirteenth century.

He also confirms the land called Pakenhale ; but reserves to himself and his heirs all services due from Fulk fitz Warin and his heirs on the said land of Alberbury, with all the escheat possibly accruing to himself or his heirs in respect of the Site of the Brethren's buildings. He also quitclaims, as I have said under Alberbury Church, the Advowson of two Prebends therein. Of this Charter there were Witnesses, \u2014 Brother Geoffrey de Nor wis, of the Order of Minorites ; Robert Blundell, Knight ; Hugh Hagar ; Alan Corbeth ; Roger de Merse ; Robert Pigot ; Geoffrey, Chaplain ; William Hager, Clerk ; and many others.16 It is dated at Caures on Wednesday in Easter week, a.d. 1262 ; and therefore some years after the death of the founder of Alberbury, and while Thomas Corbet was at signal variance with that founder's son. Doubtless the Grammont Brethren paid well for this indulgence. We are assured by the Fitz Warin Chronicle that Fulk fitz Warin's second wife, Clarice de Auberville, was buried at the New Abbey , and that Fulk himself, dying a year after at Blaunche-Vyle (Whit tington), was interred with great honour near the Altar of the same Monastery. My MS. authority adds a circumstance or two (and with great probability) to the latter fact. \u2014 \"There was formerly a Chapel, dedicated to St. Stephen, within the Site of the Monastery, in which was buried Fulk Warin, its founder, with many other Bene factors of the Priory. Thomas, Bishop of Hereford16 in the time of Warden Stokys,17 ordered the College (of All Souls) to keep this Chapel in repair ; to find a Priest to celebrate therein service for the souls of the founders and benefactors ; and to distribute yearly amono* the poor of the Parish 10s. on All Souls' Day.\" This then was the Chapel which the Valor of 1534-5 notices as yielding \u00a35. 15 Monasticon, VII. 1032, No. II. 16 Thomas Milling, Bishop of Hereford (1474-1492). 17 John Stokys, Warden of All Souls' I College (1466-1494)."], [112, "96 ALBERBURY PRIORY. per annum to its Impropriators, who had apparently got rid of the above charges on their income. I now return to other matters. About the year 1245, Gilbert Meverel of Shrewsbury gave to the Priory 5s. annual rent of a shop in Shrewsbury.18 In 1255, the Brethren are recorded as having two virgates in Alberbury by gift of Fulk fitz Warin, senior, and half a virgate in Eyton, of the gift of William fitz Adam.19 Of him I will say more under Eyton. At the Assizes of 1256, the Ford Jurors reported of a Brother of this House, one Cadugan, who had been accidentally drowned in the Severn ; but, because the Priory of New Place had buried the deceased without View of the Coroner, the Priory was liable to judgment in the Curia Regis. The Taxation of 1291 makes the Prior of Alberbury's annual income to be, \u2014 in Temporalities, \u00a32. 7s. ; and in Moveables, \u00a31. 9s. The former item is made up of \u2014 the profits of 2 carucates of land in Pekenhal, \u00a31. 6s. 8d. ; assised rents at Wylaweston (Woolaston), 6s. 8d. ; net profits of 3 nokes of land at Eyton, 6s. 8d. ; and assised rents at Eyton, 7s. Od. The profits on Moveables were 9s. from 6 cows, and \u00a31. from 60 sheep.20 These items are variously stated to belong to the Prior, the Custos, and the Proctor of Al berbury. One Officer is probably intended, and the terms Custos and Proctor indicate perhaps the strict subjection of the House as a Cell of Grandmont. At the Assizes of 1292, the following presentment, by the Jurors of Ford Hundred, informs us of the then existence of a Conventual Church. \" Thomas de Boudlers, Robert son of William de Boudlers, and five others, found John Smith of Alberbury getting billet-wood (buscam) in the Haye of Lochton (Loton). They arrested him and took him to the New Abbey, where he outgot them, and took refuge in the Abbey Church. Thither they followed, and there they slew him.\" One of the murderers had been already outlawed at the suit of Cecdy, widow of the deceased. The others were now outlawed, except Thomas de Boudlers, who was declared non cul pabilis. It appears that in 1357 John Trillec, Bishop of Hereford, re turned Alberbury Priory as one of the places in his Diocese which were exempt from Episcopal Jurisdiction.21 I do not understand how this came about.

Some rebellious attempts were subsequently made to install two Grandimontensian Friars in this Priory. The Priory-Estate and the Advowson are still held by All Souls' College ; but in 1521 the Warden and Fellows were obliged to obtain a new appropria tion of the Church from the Bishop and Chapter of Hereford, in consequence of the original appropriation not appearing on the Diocesan Registers.3* Priors ot Alberbury. The Prior of Alberbury was sometimes styled Corrector, Custos, Curator, or Procurator. He was probably a mere deputy from Grandmont, removable at pleasure.

This is not a usual feature in their statements. Another peculiarity in the above account of Bauseley is that it was ungeldable, but this peculiarity has its result, even in the present day. The immunity enabled the Corbets of Caus, or their Feoffees, to withdraw the Manor into their Walcheria, so that the Ford Hundred-Roll of 1255 takes no notice of it by name, though perhaps its tenure by Fitz Warin of Alberbury caused the latter Manor to be reputed larger by one hide than it was in Domesday. However, we have proof that Bauseley remained in Walcheria after the conquest of Wales ; and it is at this moment in the Montgomeryshire Hundred of Deythur. I have said, or implied, that Fitz Warin was Corbet's Feoffee at Bauseley. The following proof of that fact is given in an Inquest of 1277.3\u2014 ; \" Fulk fitz Warin\" (IV.) (that is, he who came into possession about 1252, and who perished at Lewes in 1264) \" held the whole tenement of Ballesleg as his right. Afterwards there was strife be tween Thomas Corbet and Griffin ap Wenhunwin. (We have had no tices of this feud in 1255 and 1259.) Griffin occupied all the land of The Gordur, together with the land of Ballesleg, and held Ballesleg till Fulcho, son of Fulcho fitz Warin (that is, Fulk fitz Warin V_), now (1277) living, married Griffin's daughter. Then Griffin re stored Ballisleg, and his right therein, to his Son-in-law. Fulk held it till there was strife between Lewellyn, Prince of Wales, and Griffin ap Wenhunwin. (This feud commenced in 1275.) Then the Prince occupied Griffin's lands (the Barony of Pole), and The Gordur, and Ballisleg, and held them all till the Earl of Lincoln and other Magnates of the Marches drove back the men of the Prince. Then Peter Corbet (of Caus) seized upon Ballesleg, assert ing as his right that it was within the limits of his land of Gordur.\" Hereupon there was naturally a strife between Fulk fitz Warin (V.) and Peter Corbet. Fitz Warin, it would seem, petitioned the King, or, at least, the latter took measures to stop a feud which, con- 1 Domesday, so. 255, b. | 2 Inquisitions, 5 Edw. I., No. 67."], [117, "99 BAUSELEY. sidering his own designs on Wales, was most inopportune. The King wrote to Henry de Lacy (the Earl of Lincoln just now men tioned), telling him that he wished for full particulars about this feud, and desiring him to inquire whether Lewellyn ap Griffin (so the Prince is styled), or Fitz Warin, held the land of Ballesleg on the day when Corbet seized it ; also, whether Fitz Warin had had any former seizin of the land, and if so, how he had been ejected. De Lacy, having ascertained the facts, was to quell the Feud him self, if he could ; but, if unable to do so, was to write to the King. This Letter of Edward I. is undated, but its result was an Inquest held, in a full Court of the County, at Shrewsbury, on February 25, 1277, by the Sheriff (Bogo de Knovill), and other Knights and Freeholders, assembled \" by precept of the Earl of Lincoln.\" I have given the Verdict of this Jury in the above narrative ; for I presume it to have been history of a most authentic character. Another Mandate of King Edward's follows : \u2014 \" If Ballisleg had not been seized into the King's hand on the repulse of Lewellyn's men, it was now to be so seized, according to the recent provision of Worcester, relating to lands thus reconquered ; and having been so seized, full seizin thereof was to be at once given to Fulk fitz Warin, saving to Peter Corbet his right, when he should wish to urge any, and saving the right of any other.\" Here, then, at least we have the English Justinian acting on the truest principles of right, though the moment was a critical one, and policy would have suggested the expediency of propitiating the Baron of Caus, far more powerful as he was than Fitz Warin. It would seem that Fitz Warin, no longer interested in Alberbury, transferred, probably sold, Bauseley to Robert Corbet of Wattles borough, and that without reserving any service to himself as Mesne-Lord. I have no record of this, in part supposed, trans action, nor does the Inquest on Robert Corbet's death mention his possession of such an Estate. But the Inquest on the death of his Widow Matilda, taken June 20, 1309, says distinctly that \"she had held the Vitiate of Balisleye, in the Marches of Wales, under Sir Fulk fitz Warin, without render or performance of any service (nichil reddendo necfaciendo) .\"3 With the Leio*htons, as Coheirs of Robert and Matilda Corbet, Bauseley remained till the eighteenth century.4 session of the head branch of the famUy after the death of Sir Edward Leighton, the nrst Baronet, in 1711. 3 Inquisitions, 2 Edw.

It left the pos-"], [118, "100 \u00bbattUstomtc$- This place, if not originally a Roman Station, has a name strongly associated with Roman ideas. There is good reason too for con cluding that this district was traversed by a Roman Road, a branch of the Great Watling Street. To determine this we need not in stance the certainty of a Roman settlement at Pontesbury, or argue the identity of Rowton Castle with the Roman Rutunium. We have a readier proof. The open ground South-East of Wattles borough is still called Stretton Heath, and about three miles off in the same direction is the Vill of Stoney Stretton. Now the name Stretton, wherever it is found, marks, I believe, the course of some Roman Road. The Manor of Wattlesborough appears in Domesday among those held by Roger fitz Corbet of the Norman Earl. \u2014 \" The same Roger holds Wetesburg. Edric held it (in Saxon times). Here are n hides, geldable. In demesne are in ox-teams and (there are) in Neat-herds, n Villains, i Boor, and i Radman, with v oxen; and there might be n ox-teams more here.\" \"In King Edward's time (the Manor) was waste. Now it is worth 20s. (per annum).1\" We thus see that at Domesday Roger fitz Corbet was holding Wattlesborough in demesne. It came however, in tbe twelfth cen tury, to be held under the Baronial House of Caus by a race of Knights, who are on all hands admitted to have descended from Roger fitz Corbet. The two races, the Baronial and the Knightly, were already divergent in Henry II.'s time, and so at a period when the mode of their original connexion is not likely to be traced. However, we have a theory on the subject, which as emanating from a great authority, I must treat with the fullest consideration, though I utterly dissent from it. \u2014 Mr. Blakeway explained the connection of these two Houses as foUows.2 He con sidered that Roger fitz Corbet was succeeded by his son WUUam ; that WUUam, thus becoming Baron of Caus, left three sons, Thomas, Robert, and Philip ; that Thomas the eldest, resigned his rights of primogeniture to his brother Robert ; that the descen dants of Robert remained Barons of Caus, whUe Wattlesborough (a mere feoffment in the Barony) was reserved by Thomas and his descendants. 1 Domesday, so. 255, b. 2. Slier iffs of Shropshire, pp. 39-43."], [119, "101 WATTLESBOROUGH. Now aU that we know of feudal law and usage renders this theory improbable, and all that can be ascertained of the particular facts of the case is contradictory to it. A Tenant-in-capite per baroniam, as Thomas Corbet is represented to have been, could not divest himself of his primogeniture or alienate his Barony in the way supposed Instant forfeiture would have been the consequence, and, fading that, his act could not have bound his descendants. On his death his son might have recovered the Barony by process of mort d'ancestre, and his descendants, however remote, could have achieved the same end by the process of Grand Assize. This is the general objection to Mr. Blakeway's theory : and now I will state the particular objections. \u2014 1. WUUam Corbet is not known to have succeeded his father as Baron. Even if he did, a probabUity has been already stated under Caus, that WiUiam died without issue. 2. There is no authentic notice of such a person as Thomas Corbet (whether of Wat tlesborough or Caus) having Uved at the time supposed by Mr. Blakeway (\" the reign of Henry II.\"). 3. Robert Corbet, undoubtedly Baron of Caus in that reign, did not succeed to either a brother or a father, but to an Uncle, \u2014 Roger. Moreover the name of Robert Corbet's father was not WiUiam, but Simon. 4. The existence of such a person as PhiUp, son of WUUam Corbet, is imaginary. The document referred to by Mr. Blakeway is indeed attested by one PhUip fitz WU- Uam,3 but he, as I weU know, was not a Corbet at aU. This examination of the question wUl be imperfect if I faU further to state and to consider Mr. Blakeway's reasons for his theory. It was supported by two things, a Legend and an Heraldic ph\u00e6nomenon. \u2014 1. The Legend is that a Corbet of Moreton, the heir of his famUy, went to the Holy Land as a Pilgrim ; that he was detained in captivity and supposed in England to have perished ; that he eventuaUy returned, and generously resigned his lands to a younger brother, then newly married and supposing himself to be the lost PUgrim's heir. Now in removing this Legend from Moreton Corbet to Wattlesborough I conceive that an unwarrantable Ucense has been taken. A Legend, removed from the place of its tradition, is at once an ineptity. 2. Mr. Blakeway considered that the primogeniture of the Wattlesborough Corbets was estabUshed by their armorial bearing, \u2014 the single Raven ; and that the Barons of Caus, having borne two Ravens, were thereby proved to have been a younger line. Now it is certain that the Corbets of Caus and of Wattlesborough were divergent races in the reign of Henry IL, and so before armorial usages were settled, nay, as Mr. Blakeway himself elsewhere admits, before arms were used by private individuals.*4 Not wishing to press the latter admission, I must stiU insist on the former truth as cogent. I do not know that in Henry II.'s time, a single Raven and two Ravens, even if then borne by branches of the same House, prove anything about relative seniority _ To mark a cadency by repeating a bearing, was a usage not as yet recognized in Eng land. I wUl prove this by the most patent example which can possibly be aUeged. \u2014 William the Conqueror and his sons are reputed to have borne two lions passant gar dant as their arms. Henry II. and his sons added a third lion. Whether this was because of Henry's marriage with Eleanor of Aquitaine (said to have borne a single lion) I am not concerned to prove. Henry II. was representative of WiUiam the Conqueror in the eldest extant Une. Evidently then in his case, the multiplied bearing was no mark of cadency, but if anythmg, a mark of assumption. 3 Salop Chartulary, No. 16. A Sheriffs of Shropshire, p. 32, note c."], [120, "102 WATTLESBOROUGH. Summarily I conclude that whenever the Corbets of Wattlesborough commenced bearing the Raven, it meant no more than that they were Corbets ;\u2014 Vassals and Cadets of the House of Caus. Later offshoots from the same stock have marked their cadency in accordance with the rules of a later heraldic usage. If we are to trust to authentic Records, the first who can be named. as holding Wattlesborough under the Barons of Caus was \u2014 Richard Corbet. Robert Corbet, the cotemporary Baron, had perhaps several brothers, but as Richard is never named as one of them we conclude that he was a more distant relation. In the 26th year of Henry II. (1179-80) Richard Corbet is entered on the Shropshire Pipe-Roll, as the second of those Vassals of the Barony who had been amerced for a false judgment pro nounced against Fulk fitz Warin. His amercement was 20s., of which he paid half instantly, and the residue in 1181. In or before the year 1195 Richard Corebett is found among the chief men of the County attesting a composition between Hugh Abbot of Shrewsbury and John le Strange.6 Roger Corebett, who attests the same instrument in a lower position, may have been Richard's younger Brother. I have discussed that question before.6 About the year 1195-6, we have an important Charter of William fitz Alan's, which I notice here, because it is attested by Bartholo mew de Morton, by Richard Corbet, and by Roger his Brother.7 Again between 1203 and 1220, we have seen Richard Corbet stand ing first witness to a Deed of his own Suzerain, Robert Corbet of Caus.8 In 1217, we find that Bartholomew de Morton, here called Bar tholomew Turet, and Richard Corbet, having been in rebellion, had both returned to their allegiance. Letters- Close for the reseizin of Richard Corbet in all his lands were accordingly addressed to the Sheriff of Shropshire.9 Soon after this, or at least before the year 1225, Richard Corbet seems to have died. He was succeeded by \u2014 Richard Corbet (II. ), his son and heir, who, if I mistake not, had already married the daughter and eventual coheir of Bartho lomew de Morton. Between the years 1217 and 1225, Richard Corbet, son of Richard Corbet, with the council and assent of his friends, conceded all Kynwerton to Buildwas Abbey, as his six Feoffees there had already given it. He reserves his own Chief rent. The Deed is attested by Bartholomew de Morton ; Vivian de 5 Salop Chartulary, No. 16 . 6 Supra, Vol. I., p. 85, note 303. 7 Harl.

Rossal ; Baldewin de Hodeneth ; Gerard de Yvelith ; Geoffrey de Folcvill; William Corbet, Parson; and William de Baschirge.10 This Charter suggests that Richard Corbet held Kinnerton, a mem ber of Wentnor, under the Barons of Caus ; also that he was very young at the time of the grant, and was guided by the advice of Bartholomew de Morton, his presumed father-in-law. In 1233, Richard Corbet appears with a son, Roger, evidently a mere boy. The case was this ; \u2014 On June 13 of that year, Henry III., then at Worcester, obliged the Barons of the Marches to give hostages for their fidelity till the kingdom should be more tranquil. Thomas Corbet (Baron of Caus), gave Roger, son of Richard Corbet, as his hostage, and the youth was consigned to the care of Walter de Lacy.11 In 1237 Richard Corbet appears as Surety for Fulk fitz Warin, \u2014 his neighbour at Alberbury. In 1240 we have Richard Corbet duly registered as holding one knight's fee in Wetlesbroc, (Wattlesborough), of the Barony of Thomas Corbet (of Caus).12 In 1241 I find Richard Corbet appointed, with John le Strange and others, a Justiciar to try a special assize in this County. In Trinity Term, 1243,13 Richard Corbet fines 2 merks for license to accord a suit which he had with the Abbot of St. Peter-super-Dyvam, con cerning the Advowson of Houton in Leicestershire.11 Richard Corbet is entered on the Shropshire Pipe-Roll of the same year as paying 2 merks pro licentid concor dandi. Robert Corbet, son and successor of Richard, was of full age in 1255, and seized of Moreton Corbet, which he inherited from his Mother, as well as of those Estates, which, being in the Barony of Caus, clearly came to him from his Father. Thus the Ford Hun dred-Roll enters him as holding in hides in Car del (Cardeston), Wetlesburh and Lohton (Loton), ofthe Barony of Caus, and doing suit to both County and Hundred.15 Whether Richard Corbet Junior, one of the Jurors who made this return, was Robert's younger brother, I cannot say. At the Assizes of 1256, Robert Corbet was reported as of full age, and yet not a knight. His estates were beyond the 15 librates, which rendered him liable to rently in the Barony of WUUam de Beau champ (Testa de Nevill, p. 92). In ano ther place (p. 95) this half-fee in Howeh ton is said to be held by Richard Corbet under Ernald de Bois, and by him under the Earl of Ferrars. The last statement is undoubtedly the true one. 10 Cart. 20 Edw. I.,No. 40.1nspeximus. \u00ab Claus. 17 Hen. III., m. 8 dorso. 12 Testa de Nevill, p. 45. 13 Placita, Trim Tm. 27. Hen.

Meanwhile, in September 1257, Robert Corbet is suing Thomas Corbet (of Caus) for disseizing him of his free tenement in Cardes ton and Waklesburg. In January 1258, Robert Corbet has a second Writ in this Suit. In December 1260, Robert Corbet was apparently in custody of the Sheriff, and probably for the forest trespass, presently to be mentioned. However, Thomas Corbet, in the Curid Regis, obtained his release, undertaking to produce him coram Rege, to take trial in case any one had aught to urge against him. At the Forest Assizes of February 1262, it was presented that on May 2, 1258, Robert Corbet, Thomas Hord, his Seneschal, and Robert, his huntsman, had taken a hind (bissam), that Dawe de Morton and Robert de Stanton were present. The parties appeared. Roger Springhose and Richard de Petton stood sureties for Robert Corbet, whose amercement of 40s., pro transgressione venacionis, was still due in 1267. In June 1262, we have Robert Corbet, accompanied by his wife, Ida, fining 2 merks for a writ of Pone.16 This also was a debt in 1267. In May 1263, we have seen Robert Corbet's name associated with that of Thomas Corbet of Caus, and apparently as engaged in Border warfare. In February 1264, we have seen him attesting a Charter, accompanied by Thomas Hord ; and we notice how singu larly his delay in taking knighthood is contrasted with the dangers which threatened the Border.17 In September 1266, as we have seen, Thomas Corbet, at instance of the King, restores to Robert Corbet, at the King's request, certain lands in Addeston. As the Patent is dated at Kenilworth, and as the King calls Robert Cor bet \"faithful and beloved,\" it is probable that he served at the memorable siege then in progress. In 1270, Roger de Merse is suing Robert Corbet of Morton, for disseizing him of a tenement in Bredeshull (Bretchel) . In the -same year we have noticed Robert Corbet's apparent interest in Cantlop. A Patent of March 20, 1271, certifies that Robert Corbet of Morton, having been an adherent of Hamo le Strange, is therefore included in the Pardon already granted to the said Hamo and his Followers. 16 Rot.

In Hrlary Term 1272, Robert Corbet appeared coram Rege to question Thomas Corbet as to wherefore the said Thomas had im prisoned him at Chaors (Caus). The matter was adjourned.18 At the Assizes of October 1272, Robert Corbet was once more presented by the Jurors of Ford Hundred as of full age, as holding a knight's-fee, and yet as not a knight. At these same Assizes Robert Corbet was sued by Fulk fitz Warin (Fulk Glas, I presume) for disseizing him of certain common-rights in Watlesburg, which belonged to Fulk's tenement in Alberbury. The result is not stated.19 On October 25, 1272, King Henry III. grants to Robert Corbet license to hold a weekly market, on Tuesdays, at Wattlesburg ; and an annual fair, of three days' duration, on the vigil, the day, and the morrow of St. James the Apostle (July 24, 25, and 26) .20 In this same year, and, I presume, towards its close, Sir Robert Corbet, at length a Knight, attests a Deed of Thomas Corbet of Caus already set forth.21 The Feodary drawn up after the said Baron's death, in 1274, includes Robert Corbet's tenure of a knight's fee, and mentions his obligation to do suit at the Court of Caus. In 1277, as we have seen, Robert Corbet, Knight, was prepared to do full mditary service under his suzerain, Peter Corbet of Caus, against Lewellyn.22 By Charter, dated at Rhuddlan, March 20, 1284, King Edward I. grants Free-Warren to Robert Corbet in his demesnes at Morton Corbet and Watlesburg, provided they were not within boundary of the Forest.23 On May 8, 1288, I find Sir Robert Corbet at testing a Charter to Buildwas Abbey.21 To the Westminster Par liament of July 15, 1290, he was returned as a Knight of the Shire of Salop. In October 1292 he was one of the Knightly Jurors empanelled to try several Pleas of Quo Waranto. To the West minster Parliament of November 1295 he was again returned as a Knight of the Shire. As holding lands and rents of \u00a320. yearly value and upwards, he was summoned for Foreign Service in 1297 ; and to attend Muster at London on July 7. He was twice ap pointed Assessor and Collector of Taxes in Shropshire, viz. in 1295 and 1297 in which last year he was also appointed a Commissioner of Array for Shropshire and Staffordshire, a service more suited 18 Placita coram Rege, 56 Hen.IIL, m. 21 Supra, p. 43. 22 Supra, p. 33. 6 dorso. is Assizes, 56 Hen.

On the 10th of May 1300, he was appointed a Justice of oyer and terminer for Shropshire.53 On the 6th of June 1300, he sat as a Knight and Juror on the great Forest Perambulation of the County, and this, as far as I can learn, is the last public appearance of a man, who, by his evident activity and prudence, raised the fortunes of his family to no mean position. His marriage with Matilda de Arun del, his second wife, brought an accession of property as great as that which he inherited from his mother, the heiress of the Saxon Torets. In addition to what I have said of him now, under Wat tlesborough, and previously under Evelith, Tetneshull, and Habber ley, I shall have more to add under Moreton Corbet. On the 14th of November 1300, King Edward's Writ of Diem clausit, dated at Carlisle, announced his decease. On the 15th of November, a second Writ shows that the King had received a complaint from his widow, Matilda, provoked by the Escheator having seized cer tain Manors (viz. Habberley, Besford, Halghton, Tetneshull-under the-Clee, and certain lands, etc., at Balderton, Burleton, Edgbold, and in tbe suburbs of Shrewsbury), of which she had been jointly enfeoffed with her husband. In return to the King's wish for more certain information, a Jury sat at Moreton Corbet, on Sunday, Ja nuary 15, 1301, and reported (inter alia) as follows. \u2014 That Robert Corbet and his wife had been jointly enfeoffed in certain tenements in Loghton (Loton) by Eynon ap Griffith, which tenements were previously held by the said Eynon under Robert Corbet himself. \u2014 That they had been jointly enfeoffed in 11 acres in Breddeshill (Bretchel), by Howel, son of Robert Pygot, which land they held under the said Howel. That Robert Corbet had held the Manor of Watlesburgh under Sir Peter Corbet for one knight's-fee ; also a place of land called Bredeshull under William de Eyton ; also 56s. rent in Cardeston, a member of Watlesburgh ; also 24s. rent at Leghton (read Lo ton), a member of Watlesburgh ; also \u00a34. 10s. rent at The Heye, near Watlesburgh ; also diverse assized rents at Bragginton, near Watlesburgh.20 I have quoted enough for my present purpose from this almost defaced Inquest. The Leicestershire Inquest, which sat on Febru ary 8, 1301, says that Robert Corbet had held the Manor of Houcton (Houghton) for half a knight's-fee, under Master William 25 Parliamentary Writs, I. 549. | 26 Inquisitions, 29 Edw.

I have spoken under Habberley of Thomas Corbet's death in 1310, when, at most, he cannot have been 29 years of age. He and his son Robert had (December 13, 1309) made a settlement of Watlesburgh, precisely similar to that which through the medium of Sir John de Erkalewe they had made of Habberley. \" Watlesburgh,\" adds the Inquisition, \" is held of Sir Peter Corbet, Lord of Cawes, by service of one knight's-fee.\" Thomas Corbet's son and heir, viz. \u2014 Robert Corbet (II.) , born December 25, 1304, was, notwith standing his evident minority, entered as Lord of Watlesbury in the Nomina Villarum of 1316.38 King Edward IL, by a Writ, dated at Kenilworth on April 25, 1326, excuses Robert Corbet of Morton, by special favour, from taking knighthood until Michael mas then next coming.29 I here suspend a narrative which I pro pose to continue more fully under Moreton Corbet. We will there take a synoptical view of the various and extraordinary settlements which Robert Corbet made of his estates, and which has resulted in their distribution among the several descendants of his younger sons. WATTLESBOROUGH CASTLE. After evolving the intricacies of remote genealogy, or endeavour ing to mark the changes of Border topography, the mind rests with satisfaction on any tangible monument which symbolizes certain broad features of the forgotten \u00e6ra, though it fails to solve a doubt, or fix a single event. As regards scale, and when compared with Caus, Wattlesborough must be placed in the second class of feudal residences. In respect however of hereditary associations, the Stronghold of the Vassal surpasses the Castle of the Baron; for Wattlesborough is one of those few Shropshire estates which have never been bartered for gold since they were first occupied by Normans. The remains too of Wattlesborough Castle, though confined to a single Tower and 2? Inquisitions, 29 Edw. L, No. 45. 28 * 29 Parly. Writs, IV. 399, 717."], [126, "108 WATTLESBOROUGH CASTLE. its Northern wing, exhibit several architectural features of interest. Tradition tells of the sometime existence of four such Towers, and of large quantities of stone having been removed from Wattles borough, and used in the construction of part of Alberbury Church. That the remaining Tower was originally designed as part of a system, and not as an isolated building, is evident from the greater security against external attack which two of its sides exhibit when compared with the third and fourth sides. In all directions bricks and fragments of wrought stone are discoverable by a few strokes of the spade. Some traces of the Moat remain, but we can hardly determine its sweep, or judge what area it was primarily intended to enclose. As regards the detads of the existing Tower, the annexed En graving will supply a better idea than any written description. One feature, the flat buttress of the Norman's, bespeaks for the Relic a high antiquity. There are indications that the original Tower either extended to an additional Story, as tradition says it did, or was finished off with a parapet, or battlements, several feet higher than the eaves of the present roof, and with perhaps a little oversail or projection of the upper portion of the work. A Roof, which, with two or three courses of stone, was removed early in the present century, may have contained fuller indications of the original plan of the Tower than the present Roof, though, as compared with the rest of the Tower, it was itself modern. This Roof was of higher pitch than the present Roof; and it had a flattened top, surmounted with a simple square turret. Possibly the original Norman Roof had a central turret. On an exact level with the tops of the ex ternal buttresses there are the remains of an internal platform, quite strong enough to have supported such a superstructure. It is im possible, however, to say whether this platform was intended as the base of a central turret, or merely supplied a floor for the defenders of the battlements, or combined both those uses. Wattlesborough Castle descended from the Corbets to the Mouthes, from them to the Burghs, and from them to the Leigh tons.

Within forty years after Domesday it would seem to have belonged, not to Roger fitz Corbet, but to his brother, Robert. Between the years 1108 and 1121, Robert Corbet gave to Shrewsbury Abbey \" terram unam nomine Loketonam.\" Richard, Bishop of London, and the Barons of Shropshire attested the grant, and, in 1121, Henry I. confirmed it.3 King Stephen's Confirmation (in 1136) mentions Robert Corbet's gift of the Vill of Locheton, as one al lowed (conceded) at the time of its passing by his son Robert, and attested by Richard, Bishop of London.* Henry II.'s and Henry III.'s Charters to Shrewsbury Abbey both confirm Locheton as given by Robert Corbet. I must leave the alternative which here presents itself undecided, though I state each side of the question. Locheton, thus given to Shrewsbury Abbey, was either Loughton, near the Clee Hill, or Loton, near Alberbury. If the former, we know that Shrewsbury Abbey obtained it, though we cannot in any way account for Robert Corbet's having it to give;5 if the latter, it is probable that Robert Corbet exercised a power which was not fully his, for nothing in Loton remained with Shrewsbury Abbey, nor was anything in Loton, abstracted ultimately from the Seigneury of Roger Corbet's descendants, the Barons of Caus. One of these Barons added Loton and Cardeston to the Fee of Wattlesborough, that is, to the feoffment of that younger branch of Corbets which held Wattlesborough. We have seen that, in 1255, 3 Salop Chartulary, No. 35. \" Monasticon, III. 519, a. 5 \u00ab\"Pra.

That was one hide in excess of the Domesday estimate of Wattlesborough singly, but yet (as was often the case in these changes) it was one hide short of those 4 hides which should have resulted from the combination of the three Domesday estates. As a result of Loton and Cardeston having been thus annexed to the fee of Wattlesborough, some mention has been made, under Wattlesborough, of both places, as well as of The Hayes (a member of Loton) . I will here add the substance of a Fine levied at West minster on November 18, 1278, and which I take to be rather a recognition and limitation of Robert Corbet's accumulated tenures under the Barons of Caus, than to imply that he had asserted the slightest claim to the Barony itself. \u2014 The Fine purports to be between Robert Corbet (Plaintiff) and Peter Corbet (Tenant) of the Manors of Caues, Yokethull, Mun streleg, and Wordyn, whereof was Plea. Robert acknowledged the whole to be the right of Peter, who conceded to Robert the tenements called The Haye of Luton (The Hayes of Loton), and also the tenement which Robert held under Peter, in Bragyntou, in Wales, on the day of this concord ; to hold to Robert and his heirs for ever ; doing for the same, and for all the other tenement which he held under Peter on the aforesaid day, the service of one knight's-fee. Peter moreover reserves to himself and heirs free liberty of hunting in The Haye, so that no damage be done to corn. Robert also was to have power of assarting in The Haye.6 We have seen how Robert Corbet subsequently bought up the Undertenancy of Eynon ap Griffith in Loton, and in a way which settled it on his own widow for life. We have also seen how Ro bert Corbet died seized of various interests in Loton, The Hayes, and Bragginton. Hence it comes to pass that these three places (two of which formed a distinct Domesday Manor, while the third was perhaps originally a member of Caus) are at the present day manorial appurtenances of Wattlesborough. 6 Fines Divers.

I have nothing to say distinctively of this Manor whde it was a member of Wattlesborough, except that at the Assizes of 1292, Roger de Forde failed to prosecute a plea against Robert Corbet (of Wattlesborough) concerning \u00a35. 4s. rent in Cardeston.3 CARDESTON CHAPEL. This was perhaps originally a dependency of Alberbury Church, but was independent thereof long before that Church became ap propriate to the Priory. The Abbot of Wigmore, by some extra ordinary chance and in some unrecorded way, got the Advowson of this Chapel ; but his right of patronage seems to have been com muted for a pension, and for the usual right of presenting (not of nominating) any Incumbent. It is well understood that this mesne-right of patronage, as we may call it, was nothing more than a method of securing an undertaking from each succeeding Presentee that he would punctually pay the reserved pension. The real Patrons of Cardeston were the Lords of the Fee, \u2014 the Corbets of Wattlesborough. This was the state of the Chapel in 1276. The Taxation of 1291 puts the Chapel of Cardinton or Cardiston (Pontesbury Deanery) as worth less than \u00a34. yearly.3 In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth rated Cardeston as a distinct Parish, whose i Domesday, so. 255, b, 2. 2 Assizes, 20 Edw.

I will treat of each member of the Manor separately. \u2014 Woolaston proper came to be held under Corbet of Caus by a knightly race which took name from one Picot, its Ancestor. The first of these of whom I find any notice was \u2014 Ralph fitz Pikot, who in 1180 was amerced 20s., among other Feudatories of Caus, for false judgment passed against Fulk fitz Warin. He seems to have acquired Aston near Worthen, with his wife Susanna, daughter of Henry and sister of Roger de Aston. Thus Aston got the name of Aston Pigot, and under that place I shall speak more fully of Ralph fitz Picot' s descendants. Here under Woolaston I will next notice \u2014 Robert Pigot, who in 1240 is entered as holding a knight's-fee of the Barony of Caus in Wilaston or Wylaveston? At the Inquisi tion of 1255 this Robert Pigot, being one of the Jurors for Ford Hundred, was found to be holding two carucates of land in Willa veston, which were geldable, but not hidat\u0153. He held them of the Barony of Caus, and did Suit to both County and Hundred. Also the Abbot of Pole (i. e. Ystrat Marchel) held half a virgate in Wdla veston of the Fee of Caus? I suppose that it was in respect of this tenure in Woolaston that the Jurors of Ford Hundred presented the Abbot of Pole as non-attendant at the Assizes of 1256. In 1256 Robert Pigott was one of those who held 15 librates of land in 3 Rot. Hundred. II. 66, 67. 1 Domesday, so. 255, b, 1. 2 Testa de Nevill, pp. 45, 48, 49. VII. 15"], [134, "114 WOOLASTON. Shropshire, and yet was not a Knight. At the Assizes of that year he was again a Juror for Ford Hundred. In March, August, and September, 1257, Robert Pycot has Writs against Thomas Corbet and others for disseizing him of his free tenement in Wylaveston or Wylaston. A similar Writ appears on the Patent-Roll in June 1258. In 1263 we have seen Robert Pycot associated with Thomas Corbet in the war with Wales, and we have also seen that in the following year Robert Pigot, son of William Pygot, made a grant to Alberbury Priory. At the Assizes of 1272 Robert Bigot is entered as a Juror for Ford Hundred. The Feodary drawn up in October 1274 registers Robert Pigot as holding* a knight's-fee in the Barony of Thomas Corbet deceased, and as owing suit to the Court of Caus. Again Robert Pigot appears as a Juror for Ford Hundred at the Inquisition of November 1274. Among the statements made on the last occasion was this one. \u2014 \" Whereas the men of Robert Pigot had been used to hold by Eng lish law, and to follow the King's peace, as Englishmen, they had. been compelled within the last 30 years, by Sir Thomas Corbet, to hold their land by Welsh law, although the said Robert Pigot holds all his land by military feoffment. The said men (Undertenants) were at the present moment in the hands of Lewellyn, Prince of Wales.\"4 It seems that William Hager, Corbet's Clerk, had also injured Robert Pigot by seizing a cow of his; and that the King's Officers in Ford Hundred had not left him undisturbed. The Under- Beadles of the Hundred (John le Tron and John Budell) had taken 6d. each from him, ad faciendum officium suum, as their pretext is worded. Howel Pygot appears as a Corbet Tenant at the Assizes of 1292. We have seen that this Howel had in 1300 enfeoffed Robert Corbet of Wattlesborough, and his wife, in 11 acres in Breddeshill (now Bretchel). In the Nomina Villarum of 1316 Howil Pygot is entered as Lord of Wylaston, which closes what I have here to say of the family. Little Woolaston was held under Corbet of Caus by a famdy whose name is spelt as Esmerulum in the first notice I have of it. Thus at the Assizes of 1203 Robert de Esmerulum had a Grand Assize concerning half a virgate in Wullaveston against William de Etton, who surrendered the same before trial. In November 1221 I find Robert de Esmerillum named as Surety ina Stretton (Stoney Stretton) 4 Ibidem, p. 96.\u2014LeweUyn's seizure of j the Gordowr was later than this.

Perhaps Thomas de Eshm, who has occurred to us in 1251 under Winsley, was of this family. In 1255 we have it fully stated that Robert Merilun holds half a hide, geldable, in Willa veston parva, of the Barony of Caus, and does suit to County and Hundred.5 At the Assizes of January 1256 we have Roger (qu\u00e6re Robert ?) Merilun as a Juror for the Hundred of Ford. From a trial which took place at Shrewsbury in August 1267, it would seem that there had been three brothers of this family. Robert, William, and Rich ard, of whom only Richard was then living, whilst William had left a son and heir, also named William. The question was whether Robert Milun, uncle (avunculus) of William, son of William Mdun, had died seized of 3 messuages and two virgates of land in Stretton (Stoney Stretton) and Wdauston ; \u2014 and whether William Milun, Junior, was his next heir ? Richard Milun, who held the premises, deposed that William junior, the Plaintiff, was his Nephew (nepos), and that such a writ as the present (a writ of mort d'ancestre) ought not to run between such relations. The Court acquiesced and or dered the Plaintiff to seek another remedy if he chose so to do.6 I suppose that the Defendant retained some right in this neigh bourhood, for I find Richard Meriloun of Stratton standing Surety in 1272 for one of the parties to a Winsley Lawsuit.7 Of Undertenants here I have these notes. \u2014 At the Inquest of 1255 the Jurors of Ford Hundred reported John, son of John de Parva Wylaston, and John Marescal, of the same vill, as non-atten dant at the general summons. In May 1271 John de Parva Wilaston proposes to sue PhiUp Hord for disseizing him of a freehold in Wylaston. WOOLASTON CHAPEL.

Domesday alludes to an unnamed Manor, held by Roger fitz Corbet of the Norman Earl, in these terms. \u2014 \" The same Roger holds half a hide in this Hundred (Ruesset), which Earl Morcar held (in Saxon times) . Here is one Villain with half an ox-team. Its former and present value was and is 32d. (per annum) .\" 1 There can be little doubt that this was the Manor which was afterwards called The Rea. It must have been situated upon the River Rea, between Caus and Minsterley, and was probably bounded on the West by Worthen, another of Earl Morcar's Manors, though not in Ruesset Hundred. The family which Corbet of Caus en feoffed here, took a name from the place, but eventually Corbet re sumed the Manor into his own demesne. Its exact locality thus became lost, and its name as obsolete as it was at Domesday. I have in a former Volume remarked that the name Rea is in distinctively applied to several streams, as meaning nothing more than stream or water. This seems to have been well understood in the 12th and 13th centuries ; and I doubt not that \u2014 William de Aqua, whom we have seen associated with several Corbet Tenants about 1198, was Corbet's Feoffee at Rea. Ralph de Ree, who has occurred in a simdar position in 1221, was undoubtedly Corbet's Tenant here ;\u2014 for the Feodaries of 1240 concur in making him hold something in Ree of Thomas Cor bet's Barony, though his service is variously represented as one fourth and one-tenth of a knight's-fee.2 In 1243 Radulf de Ree was amerced half a merk for some tres pass. About 1251 this Ralph de Ree seems to have exchanged The Rea with Thomas Corbet, who gave him some land in Minsterley. This was probably questioned by Ralph de Ree's son, for I find that in 1.252\u2014 Ralph, son of Ralph de Ree, fined 20s. pro habendd assizd ; 1 Domesday, so. 255, b. 2 Testa de Nevill, pp. 45, 48, 50."], [137, "117 HANWOOD. and his object appears on the cotemporary Patent Roll, where Ralph, son of Ralph, has a Writ against Ralph de Re and Thomas Corbet for disseizing him of a free tenement in Westlegh (Westley) and Re. In 1255 the Ford Hundred-Roll duly records how Radulf de Ree had held half a hide in a certain hamlet at Ree under Sir Thomas Corbet and his Barony of Caures. The said Radulf was used to do suit to both County and Hundred for the said half-hide ; but, four years since, Thomas Corbet exchanged that land with the aforesaid Radulf for other laud in Munsterleg. The said Thomas had, during the interval, withdrawn the said suits of Ree, whereby the King was damaged 8s., i. e. at the rate of 2s. per annum? William, son of Ralph de Ree, who, in 1260, fines half a merk for a Writ of Pone, was perhaps a member of this family, and still contesting the validity of the above exchange. From that day to this I can find no mention of The Rea as a Manor or Hamlet, and conclude that it was absorbed into those Corbet demesnes which must have surrounded it. f^an\\uooti. Domesday notices this Manor as follows. \u2014 \"The same Roger (fitz Corbet) holds Hanewde (of the Earl). Edic (probably Edric) held it (in Saxon times), and was free. Here are n hides, geldable.

In 1180 John de Hanewde appears with other Corbet Tenants as amerced 20s. \" for false judgment pronounced against Fulk fitz Warm.\" About 1203, and again between 1210 and 1220, we have seen\u2014 Robert de Hanwood attesting the Charters of Robert Corbet of Caus.3 In 1209 we have had a different instance of his connec tion with that House, he having been a Security for the appear ance of Corbet's Huntsman, charged with a grave trespass against the Forest.4 In 1240 we have \u2014 Reginald de Hanewde holding half a knight's-fee in Hanewde, of the Barony of Thomas Corbet. The Tenant's name is printed Roger in two cotemporary Rolls, but with small probability of ac curacy.5 In 1255 the Ford Hundred-Roll gives Reginald de Hane wodde as holding n hides, geldable, of the Barony of Caus, for which he did suit to both County and Hundred.6 In 1256 Reginald de Hanewode is returned among those who holding 15 librates of land in Shropshire, were not yet knights. The appearance of Roger de Hanewode as a Juror for Ford Hundred at the Assizes of 1256 is probably a mistake for Reginald ; but if so, it is a mistake of the original. In 1259 we have Reginald de Hanewod owing half a merk of gold (equal to 5 merks of sdver), for respite of his duty to take knighthood. In 1263 we have seen \u2014 John de Hanwood, associated with Thomas Corbet of Caus, and in the position of a mditary Retainer. At the Assizes of 1272, and the Inquisition of 1274, both John and William de Hanewode were Jurors for Ford Hundred. William de Hanewood also occurs on a local Inquest in 1280, and was a Juror for the Hundred at the Assizes of 1292; but John was the representative of the famdy, as we know from his being registered in 1274 as tenant of half a knight's-fee in the Barony of Thomas Corbet deceased, and from his attestation of a Charter on May 8, 1288, where he is styled Dominus de Hanewode? Within four years of that time, Hanwood and Wallop seem to have passed to collateral heirs, but in what way, I cannot declare, except that Robert and Reginald, two sons of a Reginald de Han wood, settled both estates, first on Robert for life, and then on Reginald and his heirs.

HANWOOD CHAPEL. This was, I suppose, originally subject to Pontesbury; but no Record of its dependence exists. The Taxation of 1291 places the Chapel of Hanewode in Pontesbury Deanery, and values it at \u00a34. 6s. 8d. per annum? This value is quoted by the Assessors of the Ninth in 1341 ; but they taxed the Parish only 6s. for the current levy. The small tithes, oblations, and glebe went to swell the Church-Taxation, but were not to be reckoned in estimating the Ninth. Moreover, there were no sheep or lambs in the Parish ; the tenants had thrown up their holdings under stress of poverty ; and 4 virgates of land lay untilled.10 The Valor of 153A-5 gives the preferment of John Hogg, Rector of Hanwode as \u00a32. 6s. 8d. per annum in Glebe and tithes, less 6d. for Archdeacon's Synodals.11 EARLY INCUMBENTS.

Elric, a Saxon, and Roger fitz Corbet, held it in different proportions under the Norman Earl. The two estates are thus described.\u2014 1. \"Elric holds Etune of the Earl. Siward and Uluric held it (in Saxon times) for two Manors. Here are in virgates of waste land.\"1 2. \" The same Roger (fitz Corbet) holds Etune. Elmar held it (in Saxon times).

The (arable) land is (sufficient) for two ox teams.\"3 I observe that a Saxon \u00c6lric, probably identical with Elric, above-named, had, before Domesday, made way for another Saxon, viz. Alward fitz Elmund, in the Manor of Hundeslit, i. e. Sta pleton.3 I think it very likely that the same transfer of Elric's share of Eyton took place soon after Domesday , and that Alward being in turn dispossessed, this share of Eyton went, as in the case of Stapleton, to constitute that Honour of Montgomery, which I have often alluded to as a creation of Henry I.'s. It is not yet time for me to trace the descent of the Honour of Montgomery through the famdies of Boilers, Courtenay, Cantilupe, and La Zouche. I will here give some account of their Tenants in that share of Eyton, which, to distinguish it from Corbet's share, I will call the\u2014 Montgomery Fee. \u2014 In the end of the twelfth century there was one Henry de Aston. He had a son, Roger, and a daughter, Susanna, who became the wife of Ralph fitz Picot, already men tioned, under Woolaston. Roger de Aston, as being Lord of Aston, near Worthen, gave that vill its name of Aston- Rogers, to dis tinguish it from Aston Pigot, another member of Worthen, which belonged to Ralph fitz Picot. This connects Roger de Aston with the Fief of Caus rather than with that of Montgomery. However, what he held in Eyton was held under the Lords of Montgomery. He was in fact their principal Tenant here, but how he obtained the estate I cannot say. The printed Calendar of Charter-Rolls 1 * - Domesday, fos. 259, b, 1, 255, b. 1. | 3 Supra, Vol. VI. p. 109."], [143, "121 EYTON. tells us of a grant of Free Warren in Eyton, Salop, obtained by William de CantUupe in 21 Hen. III. (1236-7) .4 This assignation of the County in which Eyton was, is altogether unwarranted by the original entry on the Rolls. The place alluded to was probably Eaton-Bray in Bedfordshire. I do not suppose that Cantilupe, though Seigneural Lord of a part of Eyton-near-Alberbury, ever held anything there in demesne. In 1240, among the Fees of William de CantUupe (then Lord of the Honour of Montgomery), we have \u2014 Roger de Estun and his Coparceners holding -r^th of a fee in Eyton.5 Again a Record of about eleven years later, particularizing three hides which WiUiam de Cantilupe, then dead, had held in Ford Hundred, names Roger de Estun as Tenant of one of the said hides, in Eton.6 In 1255, I learn that Roger de Aston had been blind for seven years;7 and in January 1256, that he was dead. His heir was his nephew, John fitz Peter, an infant. His widow, Margery, was, in 1256, suing his various Tenants at Aston Rogers, Bromlawe, etc., for dower, but she made no such claim in Eyton. The fact is, that Roger de Aston must have parted with his estate at Eyton during his life, for the Ford Hundred-RoU of 1255 records that\u2014 Roger fitz Matthew holds in Eyton half a hide, geldable, of the said Barony (the Barony of Montgomery is meant), and does suit to both County and Hundred. The same Record states that the Friars of Grandimont (that is, the Monks of Alberbury) , hold half a virgate in Eyton, by the gist of William fitz Adam, and of the Fee of Montgomery? Here the three virgates of Domesday are reproduced within half a virgate, \u2014 a trifling discrepancy in such cases : but who William fitz Adam was, or any further particulars of his grant to Alberbury, I cannot declare. The same Record gives Robert fitz Matthew as a Juror of Ford Hundred. This is hardly a mistake, for the name is repeated on the Jury-list for the same Hundred, at the Assizes of 1256.

In 1274 the Jurors of Chirbury Hundred represented that John le Knicht, of Aston (Aston Rogers, I presume), had withdrawn 3s. annual rent of a moiety of the vill of Eyton, which (moiety) he ought to hold of the Honour of Montgomery.9 This I cannot explain otherwise than by suggesting that John le Knicht was iden tical with John fitz Peter, the infant heir of Aston Rogers in 1256, and that his interest in a moiety of Eyton was mediate between the Lords of Montgomery and Roger fitz Matthew, being such as he may have inherited from his uncle, Roger de Aston, who died in 1255-6. From 1280 to 1284, Milisent la Zouche, sister and coheir of George de Cantilupe, was suing various Tenants in her late Bro ther's Barony, for the services due to herself.

We shall see, under Amaston, that about the year 1290, some tenement in Eyton passed from Walter de Ailesbury to PhUip Bur nel. This, I take it, was held under La Zouche, but how Walter de AUesbury acquired it, or what became of it in the hands of Burnel, I cannot say. The Tenants, of what name and number soever, who were holding this moiety of Eyton in the fifteenth century, were holding it under Zouche of Haryngworth. Caus Fee. Of that part of Eyton which was held by Roger fitz Corbet in 1086, we have abundant notices. Corbet's Feoffees here were also his Feoffees in a part of the Manor of Marsh (near West bury). They are therefore sometimes caUed \"De Marsh,\" and sometimes \" De Eyton,\" \u2014 an observation which will explain much of the following narrative. \u2014 Hugh de Merse, the first of these Feoffees that occurs to my notice, is said to have lived in Henry II.'s reign. He was certainly surviving twenty years afterwards, for in 1209 he and Wido de Mersse are named among those Corbet Tenants who were Sureties for the appearance of Robert Corbet's Huntsman, indicted for a grave breach of the Forest-laws. Both Hugh and Wido de Merse were deceased in 1220. The former left two sons, WiUiam and Robert, and nine daughters, \u2014 Edith, Godith, SibU, Isolda, Alice, Margaret, PetronU, Ascelina, and Mirabel. In Trinity Term, 1220, Margery, widow of Wido de Merse, was suing Alice fitz Hugh (one of the said daughters) for thirds of a bovate-and-half in Eyton, which thirds she claimed as dower.10 The suit was adjourned to Michaelmas Term, and then transferred from Westminster to the next eyre of the Justices. This took place in November 1221, and then Margery, Widow of Wido de Merse, sued, not only Alice, but aU the nine daughters of Hugh de Merse for thirds of 13^ bovates in Eton and BradeshuU (Bretchel), that is she sued each of the nine for a third of 1\\ bovates. The Jury declared that Wido de Merse had never been seized of the premises; and so his Widow was non-suited.11 The Widow seems to have taken a different course as to some land at Marsh ; for, at the same Assizes, Margery de Brerlaue (the same' 10 Placita, 4 Hen.

He, I take it, was that Robert de Eyton who about 1220-1 attested a grant of Robert Corbet of Caus to Shrewsbury Abbey.14 As Robert de Heyteton, he gave to Haugh mond Abbey, together with his body in burial, that half virgate in Mershe which William de Notone held.15 He ' was dead in November 1221, for, at the Assizes then held, a Suit of novel disseizin, instituted by William Blund against Robert fitz Hugh, for a tenement in Eyton, was adjourned sine die, because the Defendant was dead.16 Of \u2014 William de Merse, eldest son of Hugh, I have but few par ticulars. Possibly it was he who, as William de Etton, has been named in a Woolaston lawsuit of 1203. If so, this was in his Father's lifetime. He was, whatever were the time of his decease, afterwards represented by a son \u2014 Roger de Merse, who, as \" Roger, son of WiUiam de Merse, confirmed to Haughmond the half-virgate in Mershe which Robert his Uncle had given.

This is that Roger de Merche whom the Feodary of 1240 enters as holding half a knight's fee in Eyton of the Barony of Thomas Corbet.17 A Lawsuit of Michaelmas Term 1242 proves a great part of this Roger's pedigree. As Roger de la Merse, he sued Isabel de Wythbelond for 8 acres in Eyton, whereof Hugh, his grandfather, was said to have been seized in the time of Henry II. From Hugh the right claimed had descended to William, his son and heir, and from William to his son and heir, the present Plaintiff. Isabel, for her part, denied 12 Assizes, 6 Hen.

A third case which Roger de Merse had against Ascelina de Bradeshull (Bretchel), for 3 acres in Eyton, was ad journed. I think that the Defendants in these three causes must have represented some of the Plaintiff's Aunts, and possibly Asce lina de BradeshuU was herself his Aunt. It is evident to me that a Fine bearing date at Westminster on November 12th, 27 Hen. III. (*. e. November 12, 1242) is mis dated, and belongs to the same day of the 28th year of Henry III., i. e. to November 12, 1243.19 Be that as it may, the Fine is be tween Roger de la Merse (Plaintiff) and Ascelina de BredeshuU (Tenant) of 30 acres in Eyton, and 3 bovates (less one messuage) in La Merse, whereof was suit at law. Ascelina now surrendered the whole, and Roger in return conceded to her for life half a vir gate of the premises at the rent of a pair of white gloves or one penny. Moreover Roger covenanted to pay AsceUna a life annuity of 19 pence, and, at Ascelina's petition, he conceded to Robert, son of Matthew de Eyton, AsceUna's nephew (nepoti), twelve of the aforesaid thirty acres in Eyton, to hold to him and his heirs, pay ing a glove-rent to the Grantor, and performing all forinsec services. The Ford Hundred-Roll of 1255 enters Roger de Merse as hold ing one geldable hide in Eyton of the Barony of Caus, and as doing suit to both County and Hundred.20 At the Assizes of 1256, Roger de Merse was found to have disseized Reginald de Eyton of common pasture in Eyton. Roger de Merse also impleaded Roger fitz Mat thew, of Eyton, for 12 acres in Eyton, but the latter showed that he held the premises for life under the former. Whether Roger de Eyton, a Juror for Ford Hundred at these Assizes, as well as at the Inquest of 1255, was identical with Roger de Merse, is not quite clear.21 In 1263, Roger de Merse appears associated with Thomas Corbet, of Caus, and as if employed in the wars of Wales.

It was also Roger de Merse (II.), I think, who described himself as \" Roger, son of Roger de Eiton,\" and who in the time of Alan, Abbot of Haughmond (1263-1281), covenanted for himself and heirs, to pay the Abbey 3s. annual rent for that half-virgate in Merse which the Abbey had before acquired. I shall have more to say of this family under Marsh itself, a viU on whose history I have already trespassed too far. It wiU there appear fully, that the Roger de Marsh of 1280 was son and heir of him who was living in 1256. Of Undertenants in the Caus moiety of Eyton, it is difficult to say anything with precision. I suspect that a number of smaU tenures arose in the aUotments made among the nine daughters of Hugh de Mersh. Robert fitz Matthew, already mentioned as a Feoffee here in 1243, was at the Inquest of 1255, and the Assizes of 1256, a Juror for Ford Hundred. At the said Assizes, Roger, son of WiUiam de Eyton, and Robert, son of PetroniUa de Eyton, are named as Sureties in a Rowton Lawsuit. At the same Assizes, Roger, son of WUliam, and Isabel his wife (Tenants), surrender three nokes in Eyton (save a messuage and half acre) to John, son of Roger de Eyton, quit of themselves and the heirs of Isabel. In return, John, who had sued for the premises by Writ of Grand Assize, paid 4 merks. It seems improbable that Roger son of William, named in these entries, was identical with Roger de Marsh (I). In Michaelmas Term 1282, William de Eyton failed to make good a charge of disseizin in Eyton, against Peter Corbet, Roger 22 \u202223 Supra, pp.27, 95, 104. 24 Assizes, 56 Hen.

It was perhaps owing to some territorial dispute that this Abbot had im pleaded Roger de Mersse and Robert, Provost of Mersse, before Judges Delegate (i.e. in a Spiritual Court) at Rothelan (Rhuddlan). The immediate ground of action is however stated to have been bloodshed (de sanguine fuso) ? Perndon. \u2014 I cannot quit the only Manor divided between the Lords of Caus and Longden, without noticing the now lost Vill of Perndon, which was similarly divided, and half of which (the Longden half) was held under BottereU by that same family of Marsh which held Marsh. The other half of Perndon was appa rently retained by Corbet of Caus in demesne. I have aUuded to this division of Perndon before.4 It is usually mentioned next to Hargrave, which confirms my impression that it was near Marsh. The divided status of this lost vill of Perndon supplies us with a curious piece of Border history. \u2014 We have heard of Griffith ap Wenhunwen's feud with Thomas Corbet of Caus. We know that it was burning in 1255 and 1259, and that the Prince of Powis so far prevailed as to occupy the tract of country known as The Gordowr. We know that Griffith's feud with the English Baron ripened into rebellion against the English King, and that, in February 1264, Griffith was preparing in con junction with Lewellyn to devastate the Marches, and that this alliance between the Prince of Wales and Prince of Powis lasted tUl about 1275. The story of Perndon, as given in an Inquest of Sep tember 1280, iUustrates all this. \u2014 \"Griffin ap Wenhunwin and Owen his son, during the time of civil war5 (1264-5), occupied half the vill of Pernedon to the exclusion of Roger de Mershe, the owner thereof.

But when King Edward approached the parts of Wales,6 Peter Corbet occupied this moiety of Pernedon \" (as well, I presume, as his own). Roger, son and heir of that Roger de Mershe who had been originally ejected, hereupon seems to have petitioned King Edward to interfere against Corbet. The King, by Writ tested at Westminster on January 2, 1280, orders tbe Sheriff of Shropshire to ascertain by Inquest the state of the case, and whether a moiety of Pernedon was the \" right of Roger, son and heir of Roger de Mershe, formerly disseized thereof, and was of the Fee of William de Boterell ;\" or whether \" it was the right of Peter Corbet and of his own proper fee, and an appurtenance of the said Peter's own half of the aforesaid vill of Pernedon.\" If the Jury found the right to be Roger de Mershe' s, they were to report how it was his right. The Inquest was held in September 1280, before Roger Sprenghose, then Sheriff, and the facts above related were found. Summarily said the Jurors, \" The moiety (in question) is the right of Roger, son of Roger de Mersh, of the Fee of William de Boterell, because the said Roger is next heir of Roger, deceased ; and in this way his right is of the fee of Boterell.\"7 \"The Romans\" (says Mr. Blakeway) \"are know-n to have been at least as near Pontesbury as the Lea Cross, and certainly they worked lead-mines in the Stiperstones Hills. Pontesford and Pontes bury are in a line between the Lea Cross and the Stiperstones ; and' if the Romans found it necessary to erect a bridge at Pontesford over the rivulet, which is occasionally a considerable stream, and if the locality was thence denominated Pontes, the Saxons, coming after the Romans, might call a road across this rivulet the Ford or way of the Pontes. Similarly, a rude fastness at Pontesbury might be called the byrig or bury of the Pontes.\" 6 This was in the Autumn of 1277, and we know that LeweUyn had preYiously retired from The Gordowr, being beaten back by the Earl of Lincoln (supra, p. 98). The rupture between Lewellyn and Griffin ap Wenhunwen seems to hare taken place in the Autumn of 1275. For its cause, see History of Shrewsbury, I. 138. 7 Inquisitions, 8 Edw. I., No. 60. 17 VII."], [152, "130 PONTESBURY. This etymology, which Mr. Blakeway leaves to the judgment of his readers, is fortified by other considerations. The Romans have left other marks of occupation in this neighbourhood. Such names as Stoney Stretton and Wattlesborough indicate as much, to say nothing of the probability that the lead-mines of the Ponsert (or Pontesford) Hill itself were originaUy a Roman discovery. Again,\u2014 the Romans left England in the fifth century, and we have evidence that, in the seventh century, Pontesbury was called by a name, the last half of which was Saxon, while the first half was so spelt by a native writer as to show that probably it was Latin, but that certainly it was not Saxon. In the year 661, Cenwalh, King of the West Saxons, fought with Wulfhere, King of Mercia, at a place which the Saxon Chronicler denotes as Possentes-byrig. Pontesbury was undoubtedly meant, but the Latin portion of the name was not familiar to the Saxon scribe. Domesday describes this ancient settlement as follows. \u2014 \"The same Roger (fitz Corbet) holds Pantesberie (of the Earl). Ernui held it (in Saxon times) and still holds it under Roger (fitz Corbet). Here are 4| hides, geldable, and 1\\ hides, not geldable.

A Mill here renders an annual corn rent (annonam), and there is a wood which will fatten xl swine. In King Edward's time the Manor was worth \u00a38. (per annum). Now it is worth \u00a36.'n The Saxon Ernui, or Ernuin, had been a man of considerable property in the Confessor's days. Besides two smaU tenures in Conodovre Hundred, he had held four manors in Ruesset Hundred, viz. Westbury, Pontesbury, Fairley, and part of Onslow. The first he had lost before Domesday, the three others he stiU held under Roger and Robert fitz Corbet. EventuaUy he was dispossessed of all. In reviewing the Records of the two centuries which followed Domesday, a superficial observation will show us the name of one of Robert, not Roger, Corbet's descendants to have been generaUy associated with Pontesbury. A deeper search, however, proves that Roger Corbet's heirs still retained the Seigneury, and that the Fitz Herberts, though they held elsewhere in capite as coheirs of Robert Corbet, were, at Pontesbury, only Feoffees of the Barons of Caus. Thus it is that we are recurrently warned not lightly to question the accuracy of Domesday, \u2014 the greatest territorial Record which 1 Domesday, so. 255, b, 1 and 2."], [153, "PONTESBURY. 131 Royal wisdom ever planned, official zeal ever executed, or clerkly skill ever engrossed. After these remarks it will be improper to give any detailed account of Fitz Herbert's Barony under Pontesbury, for though Pontesbury was his chief Shropshire estate, it was no part of his Barony, \u2014 no part of what he held in capite as coheir of Robert fitz Corbet. Of the Fitz Herberts as Feoffees in Pontesbury I offer the following particulars. \u2014 The feoffment was probably made in the time of Henry IL, and if so, by Robert Corbet of Caus to Herbert fitz Herbert (II.) . In October 1203, as we have already seen, Herbert fitz Herbert was found to have disseized Philip de Stapleton and his wife Emma of their tenement in Pontesbury.2 At the same Assizes, Edric, Provost of Pontesbir', probably Fitz Herbert's Steward here, was amerced half a merk, apparently for preventing the Sheriff from taking Security for some debt, or appearance. In Michaelmas Term 1233 I first hear of litigation between Peter fitz Herbert (son of Herbert fitz Herbert, last named) and Thomas Corbet (of Caus). One of their Suits was a Placitum terr\u0153 which was to be tried by Grand Assize ; the other was a Placitum audiendi electionem. An Attorney, Walter Prudhome, and a Surety, Roger de DuntenuU, are named in this instance, but all proceedings were adjourned. In June 1235, Herbert fitz Peter succeeded to Peter fitz Herbert, and in Easter Term 1236 the litigation with Thomas Corbet had recommenced. \u2014 Thomas Corbet sued Herbert fitz Peter for two-thirds, and Isabella, widow of Peter fitz Herbert, for one third, of the Manor of Pantesberi. Corbet alleged that Simon Corbet his grandfather (avus) had been seized of the Manor in the time of Henry IL, taking esplees thereof, etc. etc. of 20s. value, etc. (as in the usual form of such suits). Herbert and Isabella appeared in reply, and asked View, which the Court ordered, adjourning the case to July 1st, for such View, or local Inquest, to be taken and reported. Isabella (of whom we have often heard before) names Hugh Corbet, or Ralph the Dean, her Attorney.3 This case, which so accidentally proves a part of the never-yet established descent of Corbet of Caus, ended in a fine, levied at Westminster on Jan. 27, 1237.

Corbet now acknowledges aU three parts to be Herbert's right ;\u2014 to hold to Herbert and his heirs, under Corbet and his heirs, for ever; Herbert and his heirs performing for the same to Corbet and his heirs the service of half a knight's fee, in lieu of all services. For this Fine, Herbert paid \u00a320. Notwithstanding this Fine and the lucid clearness of the whole case, a Feodary of 1240 classes half a fee in Panteburi as held by Herbert fitz Peter in his own Barony? In Michaelmas Term 1242, Herbert fitz Peter was suing Thomas Corbet for the purpose of keeping him to the terms of the Fine levied about the Manor of Pauntesbir'. Corbet, it appeared, re quired suit every three weeks from Pontesbury to his Court of Caus, and also distrained Herbert, though he had paid scutage (on half a fee), to perform the said service by a Serjeant-at-arms. Cor bet explained that it was \" the custom, when any Army was sum moned in the Marches of Wales, for the Tenants by knight's-ser vice to perform their service in the person of a soldier\" (per corpus hominis), and not by scutage, I presume. He and the Plaintiff, however, came to an agreement in Court ; and the Law-Clerk was going to enter it on the Roll, but the entry closes with the words Et est concordia talis ; 5 \u2014 nor do the Fines of the period supply the omission. Herbert fitz Peter, dying in May 1248, was succeeded by his brother Reginald. He, in 1249, is found suing Thomas Corbet as to the observance of a Fine levied between Corbet and his late Brother, whereof a Cyrograph was alleged to have been made. This Suit was still pending in Hilary Term 1250 (when Reginald fitz Peter names Master Nicholas de Breskyniho as his Attorney therein), and wras still unsettled in Hilary Term 1272.

His suit about 500 acres of land and 500 acres of bosc in Pauntesbfr' was still unsettled, and likely to remain so. It seems indeed that there had been some shifts to avoid a direct issue in the matter, for Thomas Corbet, the original Defendant, called WiUiam Corbet, Senior, to warranty, William Corbet called Brian de Brompton, Senior, and he called Nicholas, son of Robert de Stafford. Now Brian de Brompton (III.) (called Senior in this instance to distinguish him from his Grandson) was Thomas Corbet's son-in-law, and Nicholas de Stafford wras Thomas Corbet's Grand son, so that whatever either of them may have had in Pontesbury must have been derived from him.7 The case was adjourned, and I do not find it renewed. It is probable that that unscrupulous and experienced Litigant, Thomas Corbet, now on the verge of the grave, had devised or feigned a circular system of feoffments among his own kindred, so as to perplex the question and avoid a direct issue. The Feodary drawn up after his death, in October 1274, duly reports Reginald fitz Peter as holding half a fee in his Barony and as owing Suit to the Court of Caus. King Edward's Writ of Diem clausit announced the death of Reginald fitz Peter on May 5, 1286. An Inquest held at Pontesbury on August 26 following, declares that he had held nothing here, of the King in capite ,- but that he had held the VUI of Pontesbury, of Peter Corbet in capite, for half a knight's-fee, doing such service at Caus Castle as pertained to half a knight's-fee. The Capital messuage, a garden, the moorland, a Mill, etc. realized an annual revenue of \u00a318. 14s. 2c?. John, son and heir of the deceased, was of full age ;\u2014 \" thirty years and over,\" says one of the Inquests.8 William de Bolers, a tenant of John fitz Reginald at Marrington (near Chirbury), is said, in the selfsame Inquisition, to have owed certain appearances at his Suzerain's Court of Pontesbury.9 It is singular that the Fitz Herberts should have thus obliged a Tenant in their Barony to do suit at a Court which did not belong to the same Fief. 7 Assizes, 56 Hen.

By Fine levied at Westminster on July 1, 1305, John fitz Regi nald fitz Peter seems to have sold the Manor and Advowson of Pontesbury, for \u00a3100., to Rese ap Howel. John, as Deforciant, ac knowledges the grant in the usual form, and the Plaintiff (or Grantee) is to hold the premises thereafter, of the Chief Lords of the Fee. It seems that about two years after this John fitz Reginald sur rendered lands in Talgarth to King Edward II. , who regranted them to the said John for life, with reversion to the Crown. On Feb ruary 26, 1309, the King gives the reversion of these Talgarth lands to Master Rese ap Howel, Clerk, and his heirs, in exchange for the Manor of Pontesbury, which the said Rese had already given to the King in fee.10 On March 20, 1309, the King confirms his acquisition, viz. the Manor of Pontesbury, to John de Cherlton, in reward for his good services. The Grantee and the heirs of his body are to hold the same by service of of a Knight's-fee, payable to the Crown, and by the usual services due to the Lords of the Fee. In default of heirs of the body of the Grantee, the Manor was to revert to the Crown.11 It is evident that these Charters were formal memoranda of transactions which belonged to the period of Edward II.'s accession; for a Charter of September 18, 1307 (when the King had not been three months on the throne), recognizes John de Cherlton as already Lord of Pontesbury, and, styling him the King's beloved Valet, allows him the privUege of Free- Warren both in Pontesbury and Cherleton.12 The Nomina Villarum of 1316 duly enters John de Cherlton as Lord of Pontesbury.13 The Manor remained with his descendants, the Barons Cherlton of Powys ; \u2014 but of him and them I prefer to speak more fully in a future Chapter. Of Undertenants here I may notice Adam and Roger de Pon tesbury, who about 1210 attest a Charter of Robert Corbet of Caus. The former was perhaps identical with Adam fitz Eylmund, who will occur under Woodhouse. Mailhurst, a member of Pontesbury, was held under the Fitz Herberts by a branch of the Corbets. Thus in 1255 we are told that Richard Corbet of Mathelhurste holds half a hide, geldable, in 10 Rot. Chart. 2 Edw. IL, No. 32. The Manor of Talgarth had belonged to Rese ap Howel, before he got the reversionary grant of John fitz Reginald's lands there in. He had in fact held the Manor in capite of Edward I., and had had that King's license to settle the same in tail, with diverse remainders. (Inquisitions, 2 Edw. IIL, No. 62.) 11 Rot. Chart. 2 Edw.

More surely he was identical with Reginald de Pontes bury, who, by another Deed, grants land in Wudehus, near Little Hanwood, to Petronilla, daughter of Hugh de Merse, and to her brothers and Sisters in tail, exempt from suit of Hundred and from Halemott. The place called Wudehus in the latter deed is not that Wood house which lies south-west of Pontesbury, but another \u2014 Woodhouse, far to the north-east of Pontesbury, and now known as Woodhall. The latter vill seems to have been closely associated with Little Hanwood ; for instance that Adam whom we have seen to have been his brother's Grantee in Little Hanwood, subsequently occurs as \" Adam fitz Eylmund de la Wodehus,\" and grants half a virgate in La WTodehus to Petronil, daughter of Hugh de Merse, already a Grantee there.17 Again, the person called Distill de Henewod in the Deed above, had a son, Matthew, who calls himself \" Matthew, son of Distil de 14 It should be two and a half hides. 15 Rot.

At the Assizes of November 1221, David fitz Henry sued Robert fitz Sewal for a vn-gate in Wudehus. Robert, putting himself on a Grand Assize, showed that Henry, the Plaintiff's father, in whose right the Plaintiff claimed, had been outlawed for homicide in the Curid Comitatds, and been in fact executed (decollatus) : and the Defendant asked judgment of the Court whether he ought to be questioned about any land, claimed by descent from such a father. Moreover the Defendant pleaded that he had the land in marriage with Emma, his wife, who was present, and deposed that she had it from her father, Adam de Pontesbury. The parties agreed in Court, David fining half a merk for license so to agree, and Philip de Stapleton standing his security for such Fine.18 Their Fine is pre served. \u2014 David fitz Henry, Plaintiff, yields the premises to Robert fitz Sewal and Emma his wife (Tenants), as the right of Emma. In return, Robert and Emma concede one-fourth of the premises to David, viz. half that half-virgate which lay eastward near Schort hell (ShorthiU) ; \u2014 to hold to David and his heirs, under Robert and Emma, and the heirs of Emma, at 12c?. rent for ever. For this Robert and Emma paid one merk. By a subsequent Deed, David, son of Henry de la Wodehous, granted for half a merk to Thomas, son of Thomas de Leton, that noke and that half of a garden which he formerly held under Ro bert fitz Sewart. The rent to be a pair of gloves or one halfpenny. Thomas, son of Thomas de Leton, in turn gave the premises to Juliana, his sister. She, again, gave them to William de Stapleton. It would seem that Arundel of Habberley had some interest here ; for, at the Assizes of 1256, William fitz Roger, Matilda fitz Juliana, and Ida fitz Emma, were suing John de Arundel, Richard Wynt, William fitz Cecil, and Emma, his wife, for a moiety of half a virgate in Wodehus. John de Arundel appeared not, but Richard Wynt showed that he was merely Arundel's te nant by the year. So the land was seized in manu Regis tUl further hearing.19 I suppose that it was the second John de Arundel who as \" John, son of John de Arundel,\" granted that messuage and land in W7odehus, which Richard Buscart held, to Philip, son of Reginald de Pontesbury.20 If so, this grant will have taken place before 18 Assizes, 6 Hen.

These extracts will serve to identify the Woodhouse mentioned in a former Lawsuit ; where, in 1292, Isabel, widow of the second John de Arundel, was suing Isabel, widow of WiUiam de Stapleton, for the Plaintiff's thirds in La Wodehouse?1 It further appears that a family named Sale or De Aula, was re sident at WoodhaU, alias Woodhouse-juxta-ShorthiU. Thus at the Inquest of November 1274, Richard de Aula was one of the Jurors of Ford Hundred. The same person sat on a Lythwood Inquest in July 1280; on a Longden Inquest in August 1283; and, as Richard de la Sale, on a Pontesbury Inquest in August 1286. On November 3rd, 1286, Thomas le Hore and Alice, his wife (Impe dients), acknowledge by Fine their grant of a messuage and quarter virgate in Le Wodehous juxta Sherthil to Richard de la Sale, \u2014 to hold to him and his heirs, under the Grantors and the heirs of Alice, at a rose rent. For this the Grantee pays a Sore hawk. At the Assizes of 1292, Richard de Aula was a Juror for Ford Hundred.

How ever, Fitz Herbert's Feoffment in Pontesbury did not include Hor ton, probably because Horton had been already granted to another Feoffee of the Corbets of Caus. There was one Helyas de Horton Uving in 1221, and I think he was of this place. In 1240 we have William de Horton holding one half, or one quarter, of a knight's-fee in Horton, under Tho mas Corbet of Caus.22 This WiUiam de Horton had also an in terest in the adjoining Manor of Woodcote.

In 1263 we have seen William de Horton associated with Thomas Corbet in the wars of Wales, and at the Assizes of 1272 he was a Juror for Ford Hundred. Roger de Horton was another Juror at these Assizes, and he appears to have been Corbet's im mediate Tenant here, for a Feodary of October 1274 registers him as holding one-fourth of a knight's-fee under Thomas Corbet, de ceased. He occurs as a Juror on the Hundred-Inquest of 1274. On a Pontesbury Inquest of 1286, and at the Assizes of 1292 he figures in a similar capacity. Roger Guthmund, a Juror for Ford Hundred at the Assizes of 1256, had, I think, a freehold in Horton. Roger Gudmund is named in a Patent of 1263 as employed with Thomas Corbet in the wars of Wales. We have seen that in 1267 Thomas Corbet and others were found to have disseized Roger Gothmund and Agnes his wife of a small estate in Horton. It would seem that this Roger had a much graver quarrel with his Suzerain, of which this was perhaps only a contingent. Roger de Goumond (as he is called) was Castellan of Corbet's Welsh Castle of Wythigruc. It was taken and demolished by the Welsh towards the close of Henry III.'s reign, and, as Corbet alleged, was traitorously surren dered by his lieutenant. In Hilary Term 1272, Thomas Corbet was suing Roger de Goumond for \u00a3300. damages on this account ; but the Defendant appeared not.24 We shall hear of his name again under Onslow. COLLEGIATE CHURCH OP SAINT GEORGE AT PONTESBURY. Pontesbury gave name to the Deanery in which it is situated, and that is a presumption at least in favour of the antiquity of its Church.25 Something is usuaUy ascertainable about the foun dation of every Collegiate Church which has risen up since the Conquest. Collegiate Churches not thus remembered are unques tionably Saxon, and Pontesbury is of the number. The mention of Churches in Domesday is incidental, depending very much on the land held in demesne by the Incumbent of such Church. Domes day says nothing about the Church of Pontesbury, but I strongly suspect that that part of the Manor (1\u00a3 hides) which was free from geld, was Church land ; was in fact the privUeged domain of the National Saint.

On May 1, 1290, Bishop Swinfield, in course of his Visitation, reached Pontesbury. The journey from Church Stretton was in those days not to be accomplished without a Guide. Swinfield's Guide cost him one penny, a sum which according to the then value of money, w-as by no means disproportionate to the service. One of the Rectors of Pontesbury provided hay and corn for 35 horses of the Bishop's train. The other expenses of the day were charged in the Bishop's Household accounts.26 In the Taxation of 1291 the Portions of two of the Rectors of Pontesbury, David and Nicholas, were valued at \u00a310. 13s. 4d. per annum each. The other Portion, Robert de Ratford's, was \u00a35. 6s. 8c..27 With reference to the names of these Portioners, thus appearing on a standard Record, their respective Prebends were afterwards distinguished as the David Portion, the Nicholas Portion, and the Ratford Portion. In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth quoted the Church-Taxation of Pontesbury correctly, as 40 merks (\u00a326. 13s. 4fi_\".). They reduced this to \u00a317. 15s. 8d., for the current assessment on the Parish, be cause \u00a39. 6s. 8d. of the Church-Taxation was produced by glebe land, hay-tithes, and other small-tithes, and offerings.28 The Valor of 1534-5 gives the Prebends of John Coole, William Gwyn, and Louis Baker, Prebendaries of Ponsbury, as collectively worth \u00a342. 17s. per annum, in glebe and tithes. From this sum there were these deductions, viz. 17s. 9d. for the annual proportion of what was payable at the Bishop's triennial Visitations, and \u00a31.

Philip ap Howel, it seems, considered his Portion to be non-curative, and he refusing to do any duty, Walter Reynol, Arch bishop of Canterbury, commanded Swinfield, Bishop of Hereford, to collate another person. Swinfield neglected to do so. The Arch bishop reproved him. Swinfield's defence, embodied in a Letter of October 1316, remains on his Register. Its substance is that the Bishop had till now believed that Ap Howel's Portion, as weU as another Portion in the same Church, were without cure annexed. So he had learned of old, and so, as was affirmed, it might still be proved. In 19 Edward III. (1345-6) Philip HoweU was still here. He and his Comporcioner, Lodowyc de Cherleton, had subtracted diverse tithes, as was alleged, from the Chapel of St. Michael, Salop. John le Strange, Rector of that Chapel, got an Inquest on the subject, where it was decided that diverse tithes of the demesnes of the inhabitants of Cruckton, Sibaldescote (Siberscote) , Newenham (Newnham), Cruck Meole, Ardescote (Arscott), Lee, and Saxcote (Sascott), and of four MUls, in Cruck-Meole, Hanwood, and Cruck ton, belonged to St. Michael.

It is worth observing that the Domesday hidage of Pontesbury and Fairley together, was 7 hides, but that the hidage attributed to the same territory in 1255 was only 5| hides, viz. Pontesbury - proper, 2\\ hides; Asterley, and other Church lands, 2 hides; and Horton, 1 hide.

In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 8s. (per annum). Now it is worth 15s.\"1 My purpose in introducing a series of Robert Corbet's Manors with Woodcote is this. \u2014 I wish not merely to say something of that Baron himself, but of the descent, from him, of the Fitz Herberts. Now Wroodcote was the only Manor in Ruesset Hundred which went to the Fitz Herberts, as Robert Corbet's Coheirs. Robert fitz Corbet's Domesday Fief was considerably less than that of his elder Brother Roger. I have already traced the joint history of the two brothers down to the year 1121, when they appear together attesting Henry I.'s Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey. I have also shown, under Loton, that Robert fitz Corbet's grant to Shrewsbury between 1108 and 1121 was allowed, at the time of its passing, by his son Robert. We have further seen that after 1121 Robert Corbet attested his brother Roger's grant of Winsley to the same Abbey. There is a very remarkable, but ill-rendered, Charter, by Milo, Earl of Hereford, to Lanthony Abbey (near Gloucester) . It passed undoubtedly in the Autumn of 1141, and the part thereof of which I speak, passed at Gloucester.2 Prominent among the attendants of Earl Milo, that great champion of legitimacy, stands the name of Robert Corbet. There is nothing extravagant in supposing that this was the Domesday Baron whose relations with Henry I., though less than reputable, will have bound him to the cause of the Em press. If, however, the witness of Earl Milo's Charter was Robert Corbet's son, this is the only evidence we have of the son having lived to succeed the Father. Certain it is, on the whole,' either that Robert Corbet (I.) was living in 1141, and died soon after, without male issue, or else that Robert Corbet (II.) was living in 1141, and died without any issue whatever. Robert Corbet, the Domesday Baron, had two daughters, Sibil (sometimes called Adela, and some times Lucia) and Alice, eventuaUy his heirs. Sibil, probably the eldest of these daughters, was one of the numerous mistresses of King Henry I., and it was for this respect that the King bestowed upon her Father the Royal Manor of Alcester in Warwickshire. Sibil Corbet was Mother, by King Henry I., of two Sons at least, Reginald and William, and probably of a daughter, Gundred. Reginald, the elder son, was surnamed De Dunstanville. There is 1 Domesday, so. 256, a, 1. | \" Monasticon, VI. p. 137, No. III. vii. 19"], [170, "146 WOODCOTE. some doubt about the period of his birth, but I think that there can be no doubt that he and his Sister Gundred were seized of lands in Wiltshire as early as 1130, though he is, on respectable authority, called a youth five years later.3 I shall have more to say of him under Ford. There are very sufficient grounds for supposing that the latest of Henry I.'s liaisons and of the births of his Ulegi timate children were of earlier date than the year 1121. SibU Corbet, thus enfranchised, became the lawful wife of Herbert, a son of Herbert, the King's Chamberlain, and her descendants by him were legally entitled to a moiety of Robert fitz Corbet's Barony. How far they obtained it, is a question of special import to Shrop shire History ;\u2014 a question which obliges me to deal generally with the descent of the Fitz Herberts, and remove, if I can, some part at least of the errors which at present beset it. I should first conclude what I have to say of Sibil Corbet. She was apparently living in 1157; for the Pipe-RoU of that year re cords how the Mother of Earl Reginald had been paid \u00a310. in respect of two years' income to which she was entitled out of the issues of Mienes, \u2014 an estate then fermed for the Crown by the Sheriff of Sussex. BARONY OF FITZ HERBERT. Herbert, Chamberlain to King Henry I., is found to have been in office little more than a year after that Prince's accession, viz. in September 1101, when as Herbertus Regis Camerarius, he attests two Royal Charters at Windsor.4 Between the years 1109 and 1114 Thomas (H.), Archbishop of York, grants to Sir Herbert the Chamberlain, and to his son, in fee, several Manors and estates in Yorkshire (among which are Laundesbrough and Wiverthorpe) , and in Gloucestershire.5 Among the witnesses is Herbertus filius, that very son, I presume, of the Chamberlain who was included in the Grant. The service reserved on this feoffment was 3 knights'-fees. Collective evidences drawn from the Pipe-Roll of 1130 go to prove that Herbert the Chamberlain had not then been long dead. A quittance of 20s. Danegeld is recorded in his favour under Bedford shire, but in Hampshire, Herbert, son of Herbert ihe Chamberlain, pays 90 merks of a fine of 353 merks for the land of his Father? The deceased Chamberlain had had lands in Yorkshire, Hampshire, 3 Supra, Vol. II. p. 269, note 15. 4 Monasticon, IV. 15, 16, Nos. III. V. 6 Monasticon, VIII. 1196, No. CIX. 6 The 353 merks is evidently a balance, and we may conclude that the original Fine was proffered at least as early as 1129."], [171, "147 BARONY OF FITZ HERBERT. and Bedfordshire. Of two of his daughters one had already been disposed of in marriage, for Robert de Venuiz's fine for her and her dower (i. e. portion) is evidently a balance. William Croc's fine of 200 merks of silver, and 2 merks of gold, for another daughter, looks like a recent transaction. Another entry on this Roll almost implies that the Chamberlainship did not then descend to the son of the deceased, for WUUam de Pontearch purchases the Ministerium Camera Curi\u00e6 for his Brother Osbert. However, Henry I. had more than one Chamberlain. Herbert, the Chamberlain, left two sons at least, besides his successor, Herbert. I will say somethingof each. \u2014 William fitz Herbert was already a Wiltshire Landowner in 1130. About the same time he is stated to have held the ecclesias tical office of Treasurer of York. There is a Charter of King Ste phen, dated at York, which, notwithstanding two errors of transcrip tion in its testing-clause, I venture to date in February or March 1136. Thereby the King concedes to WUliam, Treasurer of York, his Chaplain, the Churches which the said William holds of the Fee of his brother, Herbert, and among them the Churches of Laundes brough and Wiverthorpe. He is to hold them as freely, etc., \" as his Father and his brother Herbert gave them to him, and as the Charter of King Henry doth testify.\"7 On Sunday, September 26, 1143, WiUiam fitz Herbert was consecrated Archbishop of York by Henry, Bishop of Winchester, and in defiance of Theobald, Arch bishop of Canterbury. He was deprived of his See by Pope Eugenius III., in 1147, but was restored by Pope Anastasius IV., in 1153. He died on June 8, 1154, and was Canonized by Pope Honorius III., in the thirteenth century. Stephen fitz Herbert, usually caUed \" Stephen the Chamber lain,\" undoubtedly held that office in the Household of Henry II. AU I shaU say of him here is that he was deceased in 1165, and that he left a son and heir, Ralph fitz- Stephen, and other issue. Ralph fitz Stephen married twice. By his first wife he had a son and heir, Ralph, who in 1222 had livery of half a knight's-fee in Lincolnshire. His second wife was that Maud de Cauz who has been already alluded to in these pages. She was the widow of Adam fitz Peter, Lord of Birkyn, and survived both her husbands. On her death in 1224, John de Birkyn was found to be her heir. In 1225, Ralph, son of Ralph fitz Stephen, was apparently dead, and Richard de Gloucester (or de Waleys) was next heir .'of Ralph 'Fitz Stephen himself, in respect of the Gloucestershire Manor of Winter- 7 Monasticon, VIII. 1196, No. CX."], [172, "148 Herbert, Chamberlain to King Henry I.

I now re turn to \u2014 Herbert fitz Herbert, the husband of Sibil, or, as she is sometimes called, Adela Corbet. Herbert fitz Herbert, with Wil liam, Treasurer of York, his brother, and by consent of Turstin, Archbishop of York, granted the Church of Wivertorp to the Yorkshire Priory of Nostel.8 There can be no doubt that this grant was made, but if the Confirmation of Henry I., which em bodies it, be a genuine document, and accurately transcribed, the grant must have taken place previous to the year 1127, when Richard, Bishop of Hereford (one of the ostended witnesses of the Confirmation) died. I know of nothing to back the idea thus sug gested, that Herbert fitz Herbert and his brother WiUiam were in a condition to grant so early. Herbert fitz Herbert had a suit with Herbert, Abbot of Westminster, about lands at Pereham and Maseleford in Sussex. The Suit was settled by judgment of the Barons of the Exchequer in favour of the Abbot, and a Writ of King Henry I. certified the result to the Sheriffs of Sussex and Middlesex.' We have seen Herbert fitz Herbert liquidating his Fine on suc cession in 1130. Of his conduct in the civil wars between Stephen and the Empress I can learn nothing, but as one of his sons mar ried Lucia, a daughter of Mdo, Earl of Hereford, we may presume that this branch of the Fitz Herberts took the side of legitimacy. It is probable that Herbert fitz Herbert (I.) died during Stephen's reign, and that Robert fitz Herbert, Herbert fitz Herbert, and Henry fitz Herbert,10 who appear soon after the Restoration, were his sons. Robert fitz Herbert succeeded to the Office and estate of his father, ere Henry II. had been three months on the throne of Eng land. This is proved by a Charter of the said King, which, by its of 1160, as resulting from a Plea heard by William fitz John, \u2014 a Justiciar of that period. In 1161, a Scutage at the rate of two merks per fee was assessed on many Counties : Henry fitz Herbert paid . five merks thereto in Wiltshire. This Henry was, I take it, the same person with that H. fitz Herbert who in 1165 acknowledges a tenure in capite of one knight's-fee in Wiltshire (Liber Niger, I. 114). It is probable that he was a younger brother of Robert fitz Herbert and Herbert fitz Herbert (II.) . 8 Monasticon, VI. 92, No. II. 9 Abbrev. Placitormn, p. 84. 10 H-E-fRY fitz Herbert was cotem porary with Robert fitz Herbert and with Herbert fitz Herbert (II.). He is entered as paying two merks in the Wiltshire Pipe- Roll of 1158. In the Wiltshire and Gloucestershire Pipe-Rolls of 1159, this Henry accounts for a donum of five merks and owes 100 merks for some convention about lands. The last debt is probably the same with one of 100 merks, which is entered on the Worcestershire Pipe-Roll"], [174, "150 WOODCOTE. testing-clause, combined with the place of its date (Lincoln), may be shown to have passed in February or March 1155. The sub stantive part of this Charter is as follows.\u2014 Henricus Rex Anglie, etc. etc. Sciatis me reddidisse Roberto filio Hereberti Camerarii, totam terram patris sui et Ministerium patris sui de Camerarid med. Quare volo, etc. etc., sicut pater suusvel avus suus liberius tenuerunt tempore Regis Henrici avi mei vel aliorum antecessorum meorum. Testibus,\u2014 Philippo Episcopo Baiocensi ; Ernulfo Episcopo Lexo viensi; Toma Cancellario ; Rainaldo Comite Cornubie ; Ricardo de Humez, Constabulario ; Johanne Marescallo. Apud Lincolliam.11 The notable points in this Charter are, \u2014 first, that the King's act was in the nature of a restoration, expressed by the word reddidisse , secondly, that Robert is proved to have been the third lineal Chamberlain of his family ; lastly, that Reginald, Earl of Cornwall, is appropriately made a witness, where the Grantee was his own uterine brother. In 1161, I find Robert fitz Herbert assessed at five merks to a Scutage in Wiltshire. There is something remarkable in the low position which Robert fitz Herbert occupies in the testing-clause of a Haughmond Charter which seems to have passed about this time.12 Of his attendance at the Court of Henry II. I cannot cite a single instance. This, considering his official position, is not without its meaning. The younger brothers of Robert fitz Herbert seem, even in his lifetime, to have been more important personages than himself. I venture to suggest that some cloud ob scured his short \u00e6ra. He appears to have died without issue be fore the year 1165, and to have been succeeded in estate by his next brother, whom I will call \u2014 Herbert fitz Herbert (II. ). In 1156, I find Herbert fitz Herbert excused his quota of scutage, as a military Tenant under the Abbeys of Hide and Abingdon. A Monastic Stemma assures us that Herbert fitz Herbert, having (as his wife Lucia's share of the Earldom of Hereford) the Forest of Dene and other lands, quitclaimed the said Forest to Henry II. for some political offence against that monarch.13 This surrender the Chronicler dates in the fourth year of Henry IL, that is, in the year 1158, when we know from better authority that Earl Milo's male issue was not extinct, and that therefore the coheirship 11 Cartm Antiqu\u0153, R. no. 33. Dugdale, and I think all Writers on the Extinct Peerage, have misrepresented tins Charter as in favour of Herbert fitz Herbert. 12 Supra, Vol. VI. p. 103. 13 Monasticon, III. 264, a."], [175, "151 BARONY OF FITZ HERBERT. of his daughters could not have arisen. In the year 1165, Earl Milo's sons were all dead, and Margaret de Bohun, the eldest of his daughters, duly appears with her share of Earl Milo's estates.14 The Record however bespeaks no similar recognition of the claims of Herbert fitz Herbert. His only tenure-in-capite was four knights' fees, entered under Berkshire, on which he owed the Serjeantry or Service of his own person ; that is, the discharge of his duties as a Royal Chamberlain.15 Herbert fitz Herbert also held two knights' fees under the Bishop of Winchester, three knights'-fees under the Archbishop of York, one knight's-fee under the Abbot of Abingdon, one knight's-fee under John de Port of Hampshire, and half a fee under the Earl of Gloucester. All these were apparently of the old feoffment, and therefore inherited from his ancestors. The Bishop of Winchester's statement of Fitz Herbert's tenure proves his de scent as I have drawn it. It is as follows\u2014\" Herbert, son of Her bert the older Chamberlain, held a fee of two knights (in the time of King Henry I.) : and now Herbert his son holds it.\"16 The succession of three generations of Herberts, and when they lived, is as clear as Record can make it. It is now time to advert to various marks of disfavour discernible in the dealings of Henry II. with Herbert fitz Herbert (II.) . It is evident that he was admitted to far less than a full share of the inheritances which should have come to him by his wife and his mother; and there is some proof that at one period he was under total forfeiture. The cause of all this is merely matter of conjec ture, but what I have to offer wdl at least bear the test of chro nology. It is probable that Robert fitz Corbet's legitimate coheirs were not allowed to enter on his Barony during the lifetime of his illegitimate Grandson, Reginald, Earl of Cornwall. Of Alcester, at least, it is certain that Earl Reginald held the whole Manor for his life, and that it remained an Escheat long after his death, which happened in December 1175.17 Herbert fitz Herbert, the Earl's half brother, was not as yet in disfavour with Henry II ., if we may judge from the following fact. Early in May 1177, the King held a Council at Oxford about Ireland, and there granted the Kingdom of Limerick to \" Herbert fitz Herbert, to William, brother of Earl Reginald, and to Joel de la Pumerai, their Nephew (nepoti eorum).18 At another Council, at Marlborough, about a fortnight after, Her bert and William, brothers of Reginald, Earl of Cornwall, and Joel \" * >5 Liber Niger, I. 167, 182. 16 Ibidem, p. 69- 17 Benedietus Abbas, p. 128. 18 Ibidem, p. 206."], [176, "152 WOODCOTE. de Pumerai, their nephew, declined receiving the said Kingdom;19 and King Henry forthwith granted it to Philip de Braose.20 The Herefordshire Pipe-Roll of 1185, gives us ample evidence that previous to Michaelmas 1184, Herbert fitz Herbert had in curred summary forfeiture. Geoffrey fitz Piers had custody of his Manors. He accounts \u00a320. Os. 10c.. for the old ferm thereof, that is, he hands over to the Exchequer that amount, received previous to Michaelmas 1184. The current year's receipts amounted to \u00a3121. 19s. 2d. ; a noble income in those days. Out of these re ceipts the Justiciar had disbursed \u00a35. in the maintenance and hire of seven of his own servants, who had been set (assisi) to keep the said land. He had also, by the King's order, bestowed \u00a34. 10s. 8d. in the livery of Herbert fitz Herbert himself; whose personal li berty seems, on this evidence, to have been abridged. Before King Richard had reigned a year, we know that Herbert fitz Her bert recovered his part of his wife's inheritance. The Wiltshire Pipe-Roll of 1190 records his payment of \u00a333. 3s. 10d., or nearly half of a Fine of 100 merks, which he had negotiated for his said share. It is probable that, during the reign of Richard I., Herbert fitz Herbert (II.) was also restored to his moiety of Alcester, and to such a share of Robert Corbet's Barony as is afterwards found in his Successors. A meagre share indeed it was ; for of five Domes day Manors already reviewed in these pages as members of Robert Corbet's Fief, Herbert fitz Herbert appears to have had an interest, and that temporary, in only one, viz., Ratlinghope. Woodcote, now under notice, is the first that I can trace to his descendants. The Knight's-service which the Fitz Herberts owed to the Crown for their Shropshire Fief, was merely that of half a fee. The first and only Shropshire Scutage to which Herbert fitz Herbert was assessed, was the 4th Scutage of John, levied in 1203. He was charged one merk for half a knight's-fee, and paid it. Before June 1204 he had been succeeded by his son and heir, Peter fitz Herbert, of whom we have already had mention as associated with the Wilt shire Law Suits of his Father in the previous reign.21 Of Lucia, wife of Herbert fitz Herbert (II.) , I would just state, that she must have lived to a great age, having survived him at least 15 years. A Feodary of the Bishop of Worcester's Estates, drawn up in 1219 or 1220, tells us of a share of two Gloucestershire Manors still held by Dame Lucia, Widow of Herbert fitz Herbert.22 19 Benedictus Abbas, p. 220. 20 Hoveden, p. 324. 21 Supra, p. 70. I ~ Testa de Nevill, p. 42."], [177, "153 BARONY OF FITZ HERBERT. She was buried in the Chapter House of Lanthony (near Gloucester), where were the tombs of Earl Milo, her Father, of three of her Brothers, and of her two Sisters.23 Peter fitz Herbert, about June 1204, gave King John 20 merks \" to have seizin of that moiety of the Manor of Alenc (Al cester) which his Father had held.\"21. It would seem that the Father's tenure at Alcester had been somewhat qualified, for King John, by a Writ of July 18, 1204, orders that a permanent equiva lent for his laud of Alcester be provided for Hamo Falconer, who, it seems, was ejected by force of the restoration made by the King to Peter fitz Herbert.25 For the general career of Peter fitz Herbert, I may safely refer to the usual authorities. His connection with Shropshire too, slender as it was, will be, or has been, marked under the localities concerned. His Scutages in that County, with one or two other matters, I will give here. \u2014 \u25a0 Of the fifth, sixth, and seventh Scutages of King John, assessed in 1204, 1205, and 1206, he had special quittance in Shropshire. The Shropshire Feodary of 1211 has this entry. \u2014 \" Peter fitz Her bert, Baron, holds in capite of the King, and owes the service of half a knight.*\"26 For the Scutage of Poitou, in 1214, he had quit tance, but his liabdity is stated as that of a whole fee. In 1218 he paid one merk on half a fee to the first scutage of Henry III. In 1221 and 1.224 he had quittance of the scutages of Biham, Mont gomery, and Bedford. To the scutage of Keri in 1229, he was assessed on a whole fee, but afterwards excused. In 1230 he was assessed on one fee to the Scutage of Brittany, but was excused. In 1231 he was assessed, at the current rate of 3 merks, to the Scutage of Poitou. He was excused the assessment on one fee for the scutage of Elvein in 1232. Peter fitz Herbert is stated by different authorities to have been married at least three times. His first wife, I take it, was Alice, daughter of Robert fitz Roger, whom Dugdale calls \" a great Baron of Northumberland.\"27 This match took place in 1203; for, in Michaelmas Term of that year, Herbert fitz Herbert conceded all his Yorkshire lands to his son Peter, to the end that the latter might provide a dower for his aforesaid wife.28 Another wife of Peter fitz Herbert is said to have been the third 26 Testa de Nevill, p. 55. 27 Baronage, p. 624. 23 Abbrev.

However, about this match there is some confusion and doubt. A Writ of October 30, 1234, speaks indifferently of all the coheirs of William de Braose as infants in ward to the Crown ;30 and we know too that Peter Fitz Herbert, having married Isabel de Ferrars in or before 1225, left her surviving at his own decease in 1235.31 These considerations seem to leave no room for such a second and in termediate wife of Peter fitz Herbert as the alleged daughter of Braose.32 According to Dugdale, Blayntheleveny and Thalegard descended to Peter fitz Herbert from his father, and did not accrue by any marriage of his own. Herbert fitz Peter, son and heir of Peter fitz Herbert, suc ceeded him, his homage being accepted on June 6, 1235. The Aid levied on marriage of the King's sister, was collected in Shropshire at Michaelmas 1235 and Easter 1236. Its incidence on this Barony is remarkable as showing, what I have before observed, that it was levied, not like a scutage or composition for military service, but on the knights' -fees actually existing in a particular Barony. Thus to the Aid in question, Herbert fitz Peter paid four merks, being (at the current rate of two merks per fee) an assessment on two fees, rather than on half a fee. He paid it by hand of Ralph de Alleston, and one instalment is stated to be on the \" Honour of Pontesbiri,\"33 a mistake which I need hardly again rectify by stating that his tenure of Pontesbury was no part of the tenure for which he was liable to a Royal Aid. In 1245, the assessment in aid of the marriage of the King's daughter was \u00a31. per fee. One fee was charged in the name of Peter fitz Herbert, whereby Peter fitz Herbert's son was of course 29 Monasticon, VI. 482, No. VIII. does not contradict, nor does the Welsh Chronicle support, this.

The two com bined would prove that Isabel de Braose, in marrying David, married the son of the man who hanged her Rather ! daughter of William de Braose and Eve Marshall, besides the three who undoubt edly married Mortimer, Cantilupe, and Bohun.

Alleston was probably Auston, near Pontesbury."], [179, "155 BARONY OF FITZ HERBERT. meant. In 1246, the Scutage of Gannok is with the same inaccu racy excused to Peter fitz Herbert. As I have said under Pontes bury \u2014 Reginald fitz Peter succeeded to his brother (Herbert) in May 1248. In 1254 the Aid for knighting Prince Edward was assessed on one Shropshire fee of Peter fitz Herbert -, \u2014 but an at tempt has been made to rectify the misnomer by the cotemporary Clerk of the Pipe. His interlineation however is still inaccurate, for it only extends to the Christian name of the debtor, and thus leaves Reginald fitz Herbert (a non-existent person) on the Roll of Shrop shire Tenants-in-capite. However, to the Scutage of Wales, assessed (and excused) on one fee in 1260, the person excused is duly re gistered as Reginald fitz Peter. From this time the Fitz Herberts are seldom mentioned in connection with their Shropshire estates. It has been seen how John fitz Reginald, son and heir of the above-named Reginald fitz Peter, divested himself of his tenancy at Pontesbury, but how or when the Seigneury over the several members of his Barony was lost, I will not discuss. Suffice it to say that I find no proof of a Fitz Herbert having the Seigneury of Woodcote after 1255. John fitz Reginald was the last of the elder line who was sum moned to Parliament as a Baron. The Arms borne by him were TJiree Lions rampant, two and one, as I find them described on his seal.34 I should now return to speak of the tenure of Woodcote under these Fitz Herberts. One hide in the Manor was held by the family of Horton, already noticed under Horton ; the remaining half-hide was held by a family named De Woodcote. Thus in No vember 1221, when Helyas de Horton was suitor for land at Al brighton, near Shrewsbury, Alexander de Wodcote was his se curity. By a Fine of November 12, 1240, William le Sermon, Tenant of half a virgate in Wodecote, acknowledges William de Horton's claim thereto. The latter concedes the land to William le Ser mon, in fee, at a rent of 2s. The Ford Hundred-Roll of 1255 says that \" William de Horton does suit to County and Hundred for half a hide which he holds in Wodecote under Sir Reginald fitz Peter ;\" also, that \" Nicholas, son of the said William, holds 34 Blakeway's MSS. The Seal was a Warrior on horseback, with those Arms on the shield and trappings. The same Coat, differenced with a party per pale, was afterwards borne by the Herberts, the presumed descendants of his Brother."], [180, "156 LONGDEN. half a hide in the same vill, of the same fee, and does suit to both County and Hundred.\"35 Later notices of this family have been given under Horton. As to the Woodcotes, I cannot tell when that Meyler de Wood cote lived, who gave two virgates here to Buildwas Abbey, that is whether Meyler preceded or succeeded Alexander above men tioned. In 1255, William de Woddecote was paying 32s. rent to the Abbot of Buildwas for the two virgates which the Abbot had acquired here. William de Wodecote was a Juror for Ford Hundred at the Assizes of 1272, and on a Caus Inquest in Octo ber 1274. Nicholas de Woodcote, who probably succeeded to the tenure under Buildwas, was Juror on a Pontesbury Inquest in August 1286, and, at the Assizes of 1292, was one of the Jurors for Ford Hundred. Neither in the Taxation of 1291, nor in any later Record, can I find any distinct mention of the Buildwas estate at Woodcote. iLontfbm. This again was a Manor described in Domesday as held by Robert fitz Corbet under the Norman Earl. \u2014 \" The same Robert holds Langedune. Leuric held it (in Saxon times) , and was a free man.

Longden was thenceforth reputed to be the Caput of Botterell's Shropshire Barony, and it is clear that the Botterells obtained a much better share of Robert Corbet's Domesday estates than ever came to the Fitz Herberts.

Alice Corbet was, I suppose, very much younger than her Sister Sibil, for at Alice's marriage with William Botterell, Regi nald fitz Roy, Lucia's son, was old enough to provide the marriage portion of his Aunt. But I can prove the date of Alice's marriage still more nearly, and show that it was later than the marriage of her Nephew, Reginald fitz Roy. He gave with her, as his own Deed declares, in frank-marriage to William de Boterells, two estates called Cracunton and Bidun. I need only to identify the first of these estates. It is Crackington, in Cornwall, about five miles north-east of Botreaux Castle. Now Reginald fitz Roy had nothing in Cornwall to grant, till the year 1140, when, having married the daughter and heir of William fitz Richard, a great Cornish Baron, he was made Earl of Cornwall, by his half-brother, Robert the Consul.2 Thus having fixed the earliest possible date of Alice Cor bet's marriage as in 1140, we know that it was her husband \u2014 William de Boterell (I.), who accounts, as Sheriff of Devon shire, for the years ending Michaelmas 1158, 1159, and 1160; for Alice Corbet's son \u2014 William de Boterell (II.) cannot have been then old enough for such an office. I have good reason to think that the termination of the first William Boterell's Shrievalty was not in consequence of his death,3 but the following Charter4 is, to all appearance, co incident with the succession of his son. It must have passed be tween the years 1163 and 1 175, and the plurality of reasons would incline me to date it in the later portion of that interval. This invaluable document I give in the original Latin, only resolving the contractions. \u2014 \" Reginaldus, Henrici Regis Filius, Comes Cornubi\u00e6, omnibus ho minibus suis, Francis et Anglis, et amicis, salutem.

One is found in his Court ; the other is his Grantee. In accordance with what I have suggested about the period of the second William Boterell's succession, I presume it to have been his Father who in 1165 is entered as holding twelve knights' -fees in Earl Reginald's Cornish Fief.12 This Fief may have included the grants of Earl Reginald himself, just now named, but more pro bably they were the essence of Boterell's original Barony in the then Palatine County of Cornwall. A Knight's-fee, which William Boterell held cotemporarily under the See of Exeter, is clearly marked as of old feojfment ; that is, it was acquired by him, or his ancestors, before the death of Henry I.13 6 Bartholomew, Bishop of Exeter, \u2014 consecrated 1161, died December 15, 1185. 1193, and died in 1216. I have not, how ever, seen other authority for presuming that this William ever bore the name of Vernon, though many members of the family did so. There was a William de Vernon, paternal Uncle of Earl Richard de Redvers (IL), who is known to have been living in January 1166, and though his age at that time must have been very great, he may perhaps be considered as the witness of this Deed. 6 Robert, Abbot of Malmesbury, \u2014 suc ceeded after March 1163, and occurs in 1174 and 1180. 7 A son of the Earl's ; \u2014 not elsewhere heard of, I believe. 8 Herbert fitz Herbert (II.), I presume, and if so, the Grantor's Half-brother. 9 Baldwin and Richard, my Grand sons ; \u2014 that is, sons of the Earl's daugh ter, Dionisia, by Richard de Redvers (II.), Earl of Devon, who died in 1161-2.

It must have been between the years 1163 and 1173 that William Boterell sold a House in the Great Street of Exeter to Richard, Archdeacon of Poictiers,1*1 a well-known character of that day, and who was elected Bishop of Winchester in 1173. I now come to the great event which associated William \"Boterell (II.) with Shropshire History more than the claim which, sooner or later, he established to a share of Robert Corbet's Barony. Isabel de Say, in her own right Baroness of Clun, had lost her first husband, William fitz Alan, in 1160, and her second husband, Geoffrey de Vere, in 1170. She had issue by her first husband a son, William, who was not admitted to livery of his Father's Barony till the Summer of 1175. It is probable, therefore, that the Lady of Clun was about thirty five years of age at the time of her second husband's death, and it is certain that she remarried to William Boterell (II.). Boterell was, therefore, Lord of Clun during this Lady's life ; and if she bore him any issue, and I have no doubt that she did, he was en titled (per legem Angli\u00e6) to hold her Barony for his own life also. These considerations will explain some otherwise unintelligible inci dents. Assuming that William Boterell married Isabel de Say about 1171, the next notice I have of him is his neglect to attend the King's expedition to Galway in 1186, whereby a Scutage of \u00a37. 10s. was assessed (at 12s. 6d. per fee) on the 12 fees of his Cornish Barony.15 On June 14, 1188, I find William de Boterell and Ysabel, his wife, parties to a Fine levied before the King at Gaitington, which concerned a member of their Barony of Clun, and Philip de Sta pleton, their Tenant at Wistanstow.16 A year later, or thereabouts, and I find, from good evidence, that William Boterell was sitting in the Curia Comitatus of Shropshire, accompanied by William fitz Alan and Geoffrey de V.ere,17 the first certainly his stepson, and the last probably so also. A Confirmation by Richard I. to Haughmond Abbey, bearing date at Portsmouth on April 25, 1194, has the attestations of Wil liam fitz Alan and William de Botereus.18 In 1195 the Sheriff of Shropshire (the same William fitz Alan) had, by order of the Arch- 14 Monasticon, VI. 436. ordinarily \u00a31. per fee, but we see that the equivalent of 13.. 4id., for a Moreton fee, was in this case reduced still lower. u Liber Ruber, so. xlix. Boterell's Cornish Pees were those usually called Minuta Feoda, or Fees of Moreton. The ordinary Rule was to assess such fees at two-thirds of the sum assessable* on ordi nary fees. The Scutage of Galway was 16 Lilleshall Chartulary, so. 83. '' Hist, of Shrewsbury, II. 418. 18 Harleian MSS. 2188, so. 123."], [185, "BARONY OF BOTREAUX. 161 bishop of Canterbury (then Viceroy), paid to William de Boterells 10 merks towards fortifying his house of Matefelun. I will not discuss this entry further than to argue therefrom that William Boterell was engaged in the warfare which was raging at the time on the Shropshire Borders. As to the accounts of William Boterell's three Shropshire scu tages during the reign of Richard I., they only add confusion to an already intricate subject. It is clear that he was not assessed in any way as a coparcener in Robert Corbet's Barony, but he was assessed largely in respect of his wife's inheritance, and in the manner following. \u2014 To the Redemption Scutage of 1194, William de Boterell was assessed \" \u00a39. for his scutage of the Honour of Geoffrey de Vere, and \u00a35. for his scutage of the Honour of Eudo Dapifer.\" Of this assessment he paid \u00a33. at once, and \u00a32. more in 1195 ; but the balance of \u00a39. was left as a debt till 1202. It was not then discharged, yet it was never afterwards repeated on the Rolls. Exactly the same assessment of _\u00a314. was made upon William de Boterell for the two scutages of Normandy in 1195 and 1197. On each he paid, one time with another, the same quota of \u00a35., and on each an arrear of \u00a39. was still marked against his name in 1202, but never paid, and never afterwards repeated. To quote the original documents of this period correctly, is an easy matter ; to explain them is far from easy. I can see why William Bot erell was assessed to nine fees \" of the Honour of Geoffrey de Vere.\" It was the scutage of the Barony of Clun, or nearly so, as returned by Geoffrey de Vere himself in 1165. But I cannot see why William Boterell should be assessed on five fees of the Honour of Eudo Dapifer. Those five fees had indeed accrued to Geoffrey de Vere with his first wife, and she had only had them in dower from her previous husband, Warm fitz Gerold. That Geoffrey de Vere had held them for his life is certain, but still it does not appear how they could devolve on his second wife and widow, Isabel de Say, or on her third husband, William Boterell. Stdl more inexplicable is it that William Boterell paid the scutages on five fees, on which we cannot make out his liability, and neglected to pay the scutages on nine fees where the payment would seem to have been most natural. To pursue this subject of scutages a little further ;\u2014 I observe a still more extraordinary assessment made against the name of Wil liam des Boterell in 1199 for the first scutage of King John which was at the rate of 2 merks per fee. The charges are \"18 merks VII. 21"], [186, "162 LONGDEN. for scutage of the Honour of Geoffrey de Vere ;\u2014 100*. for scutage of the Honour of Eudo Dapifer; and 10 merks for scutage of the Fee of Clun.\" Here, even according to the precedent of King Richard's Pipe-Rolls, there is a manifest redundancy. The second and third charges should have stood as one, viz. \" 10 merks for the Honour of Eudo Dapifer.\" The Fee of Clun was in fact the Fief assessed in the first item at 18 merks. However not a farthing of the three charges was ever paid, nor were they permanently re newed. In short, I suppose that William Boterell's wife was dead, and I think that his Shropshire liabilities, real or supposed, had before this time been compounded for by his step-son, William fitz Alan, the latter undertaking to pay \u00a3100. to the Crown in quit tance thereof, and in lieu of all demands which his step-father may have had on Isabel de Say's estates. This very Pipe-Roll of 1199 records that \" William fitz Alan owes \u00a3100., which he is bound to pay for William des Boterell, by authority of Justiciars, and ac cording to Fine made between them (Fitz Alan and Boterell) , which money had previously been put in charge of Cornwall.\" William fitz Alan paid, in 1202, the last instalment in the Fine of \u00a3100., \" which he owed for William de Boterell ; \u2014 and he was quit.\" I must briefly allude to the Charters whereby Isabel de Say and William de Boterell granted and insured the Churches of Clun and the surrounding district to Wenlock Priory. These Charters have genealogical significances which bear upon our present investigation. Both Charters probably passed in the reign of Richard I., and I should imagine that Boterell's Charter was expedited immediately after his wife's, that is during her life, not upon her decease. Both Charters have the same witnesses, or nearly so, a further symptom of their having followed each other quickly. Instead of Boterell's joining in his wife's grant, or even attesting it, it is curious that he expedites a separate Charter, granting the aforesaid Churches \" ac cording to the tenour of the Charter of Dame Isabel de Say, his wife.\" The reason of this severance, where a single Charter would have been legally sufficient, is apparent in the different Movent Clauses of the two Deeds. Dame Isabel's Deed is, pro amore Dei et pro salute anim\u00e6 me\u00e6, et pro salute Domini Willielmi filii Alani et mei et pro animd patris met et matris me\u00e6 el omnium antecessorum et successorum meorum. Boterell's is pro salute anim\u00e6 me\u00e6 et Willielmi filii mei. I take the William fitz Alan, named in Isabel's Deed, to have been her living son rather than her deceased husband ; and I take"], [187, "163 HARONY OF BOTREAUX. William de Boterell's son, named in his Deed to have been his son, whether living or dead, by Isabel de Say. It is probable that Wil- liam fitz Alan's inspeximus and confirmation of his Mother's Charter passed after her death, for the movent clause contains the words pro animabus patris et matris me\u00e6 et pro salute med.19 This Charter, I further think, passed some years after his mother's death, and in the reign of King John. It shows that William de Boterell survived Isabel de Say, for it is attested by him and his nephew Robert. This Charter has another pair of witnesses whose occurrence is remarkable. It is attested by William, son of the Grantor, and by John his bro- ther, who were present at the expediting of the Charter (qui inter fuerunt hujus cart\u0153 donacioni) . Now in the year 1210 the last year of William fitz Alan's life, the eldest of these boys cannot have been more than sixteen years old. This then convinces me of what I long since heard from a very competent authority,20 viz. that mere boys were occasionally alleged to be formal witnesses of medi\u00e6val Charters. I should now notice that John Plantagenet, while Earl of Moreton, made a grant of certain lands in Ireland, first to Reginald de Boterell and afterwards to William his brother. One Maurice fitz Philip, alleging himself to have had Charters of these lands from both Earl John's Grantees, was suing another claimant thereof in 1199.21 I take it that Reginald and William de Boterell, here alluded to, were the sons of William de Boterell (I.), and that Reginald, the younger, had died without issue. I now proceed with William Boterell (II.) . \u2014 One of the earliest Oblata proffered to King John after his Coro nation (May 27, 1199) was as follows. \u2014 \"William de Boterell gives the King 300 merks and two Destriers for Seizin to be had of land in Cornwall, viz. Penhell, with its appurtenances, and half the Vill of Alencestre (Alcester, Warwickshire), and for his Charter to be confirmed, which Charter (being the act or Deed) of Reginald, Earl of Cornwall, concerning the same land, he (Boterell) has.\"22 \u00bb Wenlock Register at Trentham, so. 24. 20 Mr. George Mon-is, of Shrewsbury. 21 Oblata, p. 36. 22 Oblata and Fines, p. 2.

King John's Charter in return to this Fine says nothing about Alcester, which in fact had not been named in Earl Reginald's Deed. The King's Confirmation, dated at Northampton on June 7, 1199, is in these words. \u2014 Johannes D. G.

Hiis Testibus. H. Cantuar. Archiepiscopo. Hugone Pantul?z I submit that these documents indicate that the present Grantee was identical with Earl Reginald's Grantee, and not heir of that Grantee. I say this, although it is difficult to see why so high a Fine should have been offered, that the King, as Earl of Cornwall, might merely confirm the act of a preceding Earl, unless the Fine were one on succession of the Grantee. By the Devonshire Pipe-Roll of 1201 it would seem that William Boterell had been serving King John in his French wars, for he is debited with a pr\u00e6stitum of 20 merks, made to him by the King de ultra mare. The Palatine Earldom of Cornwall was now in the Crown, so the Sheriff of Cornwall enters 13 Librates of land held by William Boterel in Penhel, and 6 Librates, held by him in Bideni and Winenine, as so much deducted from the Perm of the County.- \u2014 This is a complete proof that the lands granted to Wil liam Boterell's father by Earl Reginald were distinct from the an cient Barony of Boterell, which of course could not be brought into the Firma Comitatus at all. The Barony is alluded to in another part of the same Roll, where the Sheriff records that William Boterel is acquitted by Writ, of the second Scutage of King John, assessable on 12 fees of the Honour of Moreton. To the same Scutage in Shropshire, William fitz Alan is charged in respect of the Barony of Clun; \u2014 again a proof that the Boterell who had been Lord of Clun was no longer so. The year 1203 introduces William Boterell to his Shropshire Barony as a coheir of Robert Corbet, but how he obtained recog nition of his claims I know not. At the Shropshire Assizes of Oc tober 1203, he, as a Knight, chose several Juries to try causes of Grand Assize. He was also found to have disseized Philip de Sta pleton of a tenement in Stapleton, and had to pay damages of half a merk. Obviously he had annexed to his Manor of Longden some- 23 Cartes Anliqu\u0153, B. 3."], [189, "165 BARONY OF BOTREAUX. thing which belonged to Stapleton, and, as we have seen, his Copar cener, Herbert fitz Herbert, had similarly wronged Philip de Sta pleton at Pontesbury. In the next few years we have seen, under Ratlinghope, that William Boterell was exercising another kind of supremacy over his Shropshire estates.24 Between September 1203 and June 1204, William Boterell fined for, and obtained, the marriage of Albreda, widow of John de Ingeham,and daughter and coheir of Walter Waleran. For this marriage he paid two horses for the great saddle and a Norway Goshawk, besides 300 merks, which Albreda had previously offered, for her re-marriage to any loyal subject she might choose.25 This Fine, being charged in the Warwickshire Pipe-Roll, indicates that William Boterell had recovered his share of Alcester. I suppose that this match with Albreda Waleran did not eventually benefit the Boterells, for the Lady's descendants, by her first husband, succeeded to her estates on her death, which, it is singular to relate, is not reported of, till sixty -six years after her marriage with Boterell. On April 5, 1204, King John appointed William Boterell to be Sheriff of Cornwall,26 an office which he held till 1208-9. Many instances occur on the Rolls of the trust and favour with which King John regarded him, but we are surprised to see, that though Sheriff of Cornwall, he was obliged to compound for foreign service by a payment of 40 merks, in addition to the ordinary Scutage.27 The latest notice which I have of William de Boterell as apparently living, is of date June 28, 1210, when three of his Knights were in attendance on King John in Ireland.28 I return to say a word about the Shropshire Scutages of William Boterell. In 1203 and 1204 he was excused his quota of the fourth and fifth scutages of King John. In 1205 he paid 1 merk (the proportion due on half a knight's-fee) to the sixth Scutage. In 1206 he was excused his contribution to the seventh Scutage. A Roll of Shropshire Tenures-in-Capite, which I date in 1210, gives the services of Peter fitz Herbert and William de Boterell as half a knight's-fee each.29 In Warwickshire they owed, conjointly, (for Alcester of course), the service of fths of a knight's-fee. A Shropshire Tenure-RoU, evidently returned in July 1211, marks the previous death of William Boterell in these words.\u2014\" Williel mus Botrealus, Baro, tenuit in capite de domino Rege per servicium \"7 Fines, p. 294.

He left two sons at least, William and Regi nald. I will first speak of the eldest, styling him \u2014 William de Boterell (III.). A Devonshire Roll, about the year 1211, states his Manor of Mouland to be in custody of Roger de Mortimer, by reason of his minority.31 A Writ-Close of January 16, 1215, shows his Cornish Fief committed to the care of Hugh Peverel, of Sandford, who is to account for the issues to the Crown.32 On December 13, 1220, William, son of William Boterell, had fined 80 merks, with King Henry III., for seizin of his Father's lands ; and the Sheriff of Cornwall was ordered to invest him therewith accordingly.33 It is evident then, either that William de Boterell (III.) was his father's son by a previous wife to Albreda Waleran, or else that he obtained his livery more than four years before he was of age. Be this as it may, he was at the siege of Biham with King Henry in February 1221, and had letters for assessing scutage on his Tenants in respect of his personal service.34 All I can say further of William de Boterell's Shropshire interests, is involved in those of his Mother, or Step-Mother, Albreda. Of him, personally, I may say that a Patent of Protection, dated April 20, 1230, shows that he then accompanied King Henry to Brittany, and that on June 7, 1243, he being dead without issue, livery of his Warwick shire Estate was given to Reginald de Boterell, as his brother and heir.36 The Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 1243 shows that Reginald paid 100s. for his Relief, and that the seizin accorded to him ex tended to lands held in capite in Langedon by his deceased Brother. I now return to \u2014 Albreda, widow of William Boterell (III.). In 1214 she, as Albrea de Boterells, had quittance of the Scutage of Poitou in re spect of one Fee held in capite in Shropshire. We have seen under 30 * 31 Testa de Nevill, p. 55, 194. a mother at two periods, with the impro bable interval of 40 years or more. And as William Boterell (III.) seems too young to have been the son of Isabel de Say, so he seems too old to have been the son of Albreda Waleran. I leave the difficulty as a difficulty, for it is vain, without an atom of direct evidence, to suggest that William Boterell (II.) may have married three wives, \u2014 the second unknown and unnamed, but the Mother of his heir. 32 Rot.

In 1218 the first scutage of Henry III. is assessed in Shropshire on half a fee, held by William de Botterell, and he pays the merk proportionate thereto; but in 1221 it is Albreda de Boterell who is excused the Scutage of Biham in the Shropshire Pipe- Roll. We know that Albrea de Boterell had letters of Scutage on this occasion as well as William.36 The Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 1224 assesses William de Boterell one merk to the Scutate of Montgomery, and assesses and then excuses him the Scutage of Bed ford. The assessment to the Scutage of Keri in 1229 adds a new element to this confusion. It charges nothing on William de Boterell, but it charges two merks on a whole knight's-fee, quod suit Albred\u00e6 de Botterell, and gives John fitz Alan as the person charged and apparently paying the impost. Again in 1230, to the Scutage of Brittany, John fitz Alan is charged \u00a32. on one Fee of Albreda de Boterell ; but the same Roll also charges William de Boterell 20s. scutage, on half a knight's-fee, and adds that he had since had an acquittance of this debt. In 1231 the Scutage of Poitou is excused in respect of half a fee held by William de Boterell, but assessed, at the current rate of 3 merks, on John fitz Alan, for one fee, quod suit Albrede de Boterell. In 1232, 20s. of the Scutage of Elvein is charged on John fitz Alan for one fee, quod suit Albred\u00e6 de Boterell, while William de Boterell is excused Scutage on half a fee. I have before noticed that the Aid on marriage of the King's Sister, assessed in 1235-6, was charged in some instances on the actual fees of a Barony, and not on the same conventional basis as governed the assessment to a Scutage. To this Aid \"William de Boteraus of Longedon was charged and paid \u00a32. 2s., that is, about two merks per fee on 1 fee, | fee, and T'3- fee of the Honour of Longedon. William, brother of Geoffrey Orry, paid the assessment on behalf of Boteraus.37 In 1245, though William de Boterell was dead, he is still charged 10s. on half a fee to the Aid on marriage of the King's daughter, and John fitz Alan is also charged \u00a31. as usual on one fee.

Ham de Boterell is entered as paying 20s. on half a fee, while John fitz Alan stands acquitted of the proportionate charge on one fee, quod suit Albred\u00e6 Boterell. If we turn to the Feodaries of 1240 we meet with confusion of a different kind. (1.) In one place Albreda de Botereus is repre sented as having the Seigneury of 1 fee in Longedon and \\ fee in Woolstaston. (2.) In another place Longdon (\\ fee), is classified under the Barony of Herbert fitz Peter, and said to be held by Al breda de Botereus. (3.) A third Feodary has Woolstaston (\\ fee) as held under Hugh de Kilpec.38 All that is correct in these entries is that Longdon (\\ fee) and Woolstaston (\\ fee) were members of the Barony of Boterell. As to Scutages, we must conclude that the whole Shropshire Barony of Boterell was liable to military Aids, as a Tenure of \\\\ fees. How Fitz Alan became answerable, instead of Albreda de Boterell, for the whole fee, I cannot say. I shall be able however to show elsewhere that Fitz Alan, at some time or other, did obtain the Seigneury of a very small portion of Boterell's Barony. William Boterell's liability for the | fee, as long as he was alive, is intelligible enough. Reginald de Boterell, whom we have seen succeeding to his elder brother William in 1243, was in 1254 returned as holding 20 librates of land in Shropshire or Staffordshire. In 1255 the Jurors of Ford Hundred said with great apparent ac curacy that \"Sir Reginald de Boterel holds two hides, geldable, in the Manor of Longedon, by service of half a knight's-fee, and of the King in capite. He did suit to both County and Hundred.\"39 At the Assizes of 1256 the same Jurors reported him as not in due attendance. On August 1, 1270, Albreda de Boterell being dead, the King received the homage of Oliver de Ingeham as her heir.40 He was, I think, her Grandson, son of her son Walter, who was deceased in 1253. In July 1271 Reginald de Botreaux has a Writ of mort d'ancestre against Philip Marmion and Joan his wife, concerning 40 acres of bosc in Longedon. At the Assizes of 1272 the Ford Jurors reported Reginald de Botereus as non-attendant.

In ac cordance with this view, the Feodary of 1284 states precisely that the said Bishop holds Langedon of the King in capite, for half a knight's fee, doing the service of two foot-soldiers in time of war, for 40 days, at his own cost. At the Assizes of 1292 Philip Burnel being ques tioned as to his tenure of the Manor of Longedon, worth \u00a310. per annum, and held by Serjeantry of finding two foot-soldiers, etc., stated that he had held it of his deceased Uncle, the Bishop, all whose muniments were in the King's hands. He fined 1 merk to be undisturbed in this tenure till January following. The Inquest on Philip Burnel's death records his tenure-in-capite of Longedon, by service of a Lancer and an Archer, etc.44 The Inquest taken in October 1315, after Edward Burnell's death, would make it appear that the Tenure of Longden had been changed. It was now held of the King, as of the Honour of Montgomery, for Jth of a knight's fee. It was valued at \u00a312. 15s. 9d. per annum.*5 This Inquest includes among the appurtenances of Longden the rents of certain free tenants in Bishop's Castle and Priest's-Weston. How these rents became associated with Longden, I need not here discuss. In the Nomina Villarum of 1316 John de Hawelou (Haudloe) is entered as Lord of Longedon.46 Longdon, then, like Woolstaston, was thus severed from the Barony of Botterell, and annexed to that of Burnel.

The same person was a Juror on a Worthen Inquest in 1246. In 1255 the Inquest of Ford Hundred says that \" Adam de Brerlawe (himself a Juror) holds one hide, geldable, in Wygimor and Brer lawe, which pertain to the Manor of Longedon,\" that is, I suppose, were held under Boterell. \"Adam did Suit to County and Hun dred.\"3 He was a Juror for Ford Hundred at the Assizes of 1256 and 1272, a Juror on a Longden Inquest in September 1274, and a Juror on the Inquest of Ford Hundred in November following. Meantime, that is, on June 3, 1259, Matilda de Stretton has a Writ of mort d'ancestre against Adam de Brerlawe and Roger Pigod con cerning two messuages and some land in Wigmore. In the Welsh Wars of 1263 we have seen Adam de Brerlawe associated with Thomas Corbet of Caus and other inhabitants of the frontier. Adam de Brerlawe was in fact Thomas Corbet's Tenant at Lower Melling ton (near Chirbury), and there we shall hear of him again. To mention a Tenant of Thomas Corbet is to name a victim or a personal foe of that Ishmael of the Borders. \u2014 At the Assizes of 1267 Thomas Corbet was found to have disseized Adam de Brerlawe of a Water- Mill in Brerlawe.

The only evidence I have of the Arundels thus being Mesne-Lords of Onslow, is in the Ford Hun dred-Roll of 1255, where John de Arundel is said to hold one geld able hide in Ondeslawe, under the Manor of Longedon, and to do suit to both County and Hundred.2 Arundel' s Tenants at Onslow, or at least the chief of them, were also Tenants of St. Chad's moiety of the Manor. I will not there fore undertake to say, that all the following entries relate to Arun del's moiety. In 1190, Adam de Hundreslawe was amerced 3s. 4d. pro falso dicto? At the Assizes of 1203, a Suit between John de Ondeslawe and William de Bikedon (Bicton) concerning a right of common between Onslow and Bicton was settled in this way. \u2014 John was for three years to plough and till 12 acres of the pasture in question, and after the said three years expired, the said 12 acres were to re main common to both parties, so that neither of them should till the same.4 By Fine, levied November 23, 1236, Roger de Ondes lawe concedes a disputed right of common in Ondeslawe to Nicholas, Abbot of Buildwas, who allows that Roger and his heirs shall have 120 sheep in the said Common. I presume some right appurtenant to the Abbot's estate at Woodcote had been in dispute. This Roger de Ondeslawe appears as holding the St. Chad's share of Onslow in 1255 and 1284, unless there were two persons of the same name. Also there was a Roger de Hundeslawe, who chose the Jurors for Ford Hundred at the Assizes of 1272, who sat on a Caus Inquest in October 1274, and who, as Roger de Eydeslawe, was on the Inquest of Ford Hundred in November 1274. He ap pears too on a Longden Jury in 1274, on the Inquest after the death of John le Strange in 1276, and on a Bausley Jury in 1277. There was, further, a Roger fitz Warin of Onslow, a Juror at an Eyton Inquest in 1256, and at the Assizes of 1272, and at the In quest of 1274.

We have seen one Roger de Say with a mesne-interest at Hope Bowdler, in 1201-2, where he was Tenant of Robert de Bullers, Lord of Montgomery.3 We have also seen Roger de Say attesting a Deed of William de Courtenay, a succeeding Lord of Mont gomery.

By a Patent of September 15, 1235, Justices are appointed to try a charge of novel disseizin, preferred by Amice and Lucia, daughters of Roger de Say, against Thomas Corbet (of Caus), concerning a tenement in Anbaldeston. It appears that the wood of Amboldes ton was in dispute, and that these Coheiresses recovered it in the following year.4 Correcting an Inquest, or Tenure- Roll, which must have been drawn up about 1251, I gather the following meaning from an entry under Ford Hundred. \u2014 \"William de Cantilupe held three hides of land in Eton (Eyton, near Alberbury), Sunton (read Row ton) and Amboldeston, of the King in capite, of the Fee of Mont gomery; whereof Nicholas Murel (Meverel) holds i hide in Stun ton (read Rowton) and Amboldeston; John le Poer holds i hide in Stunton (read Rowton) and Amboldeston ; and Roger de Eston holds i hide in Eton\" (Eyton).5 The meaning of this, as far as it concerns us now, is that Nicholas Meverel and John le Poer having married Lucia and Amice, daugh ters and coheirs of Roger de Say, held Amaston and Rowton under the estate of William de Cantilupe, who died in 1251. The Ford Hundred-Roll of 1255 says that \" John le Poer and Nicholas Meverel hold in Dunton (read Rowton) and Ambaldeston two geldable hides of the Barony (add of Montgomery); and John le Poer does suit to County and Hundred for the said hides. Also William de Bikidon, Tenant of one virgate, included in the said hides, does suit to County and Hundred for the said hides,\" as a consideration for this tenancy.6 As early as Hilary Term 1250, a second suit had commenced between the Coparceners of Amaston and Rowton, and Thomas Corbet of Caus. Nicholas Meverel on that occasion had merely appointed Richard Meverel his Attorney. In July following, the Suit of Nicholas and Lucia Meverel and John and Amice le Poer against Thomas Corbet, concerning land, was adjourned till January 1251.7 Lucia Meverel had essoigned her attendance on account of sickness (de malo lecti) . The Sheriff of Staffordshire was ordered to send four knights to Geyton to ascertain the honesty of the essoign. This shows us that Nicholas Meverel was of Gayton (Staf fordshire) .

The sentence was against the latter, and Corbet recovered his seizin.9 At the same Assizes, John and Avice le Poer and Nicholas and Lucia Meverel, having taken out Co- Writs (conbrevia) against David Boylin and Robert Gerebonde concerning a tenement in Alvaldeston, neglected to prosecute. Their Sureties de prosequendo were Howel de Ambaldeston and Hugh Coly of Ruton (Rowton) . In Easter Term 1263, Roger Gumund, being sued by Lucia, daughter of Roger de Say, for 40 acres in Amblaston, called Roger Gumund, Senior, to warranty, and was ordered to have him in Court at Westminster on June 25 following. By a Fine, levied at Westminster on October 6, 1261, it appears that Roger Godmund, Richard and Emma Gronow, John fitz Pe tronil, William Welin, Richard fitz Asceline, Floria fitz Olyva, and Margery her sister, had been jointly suing John and Amice le Poer for 23i acres in Amboldeston : \u2014 and had also been suing the same John and Amice, as called to warranty by Geoffrey le Poer, for other 23J acres there. The Plaintiffs now renounced their claim (for themselves and the heirs of Roger Gudmund, Emma Gronow, John fitz Petronil, William Welin, Richard fitz Asceline, Floria and Margery fitz Olyva) to the said John and Amice le Poer, and the heirs of Amice, for 4 merks. From the ancient Calendar of Inquisitions, I infer that the lost Inquest, taken in 1273 as to the Montgomery Fees of George de Cantilupe, deceased, did not mention Amaston, but mentioned Ruton.10 We may partly infer what was said, from the Ford Hun dred-Roll of 1274, where the Jurors of Chirbury Hundred declare that \" Roger de Say, deceased, had held, all his life, the Vills of Ruton and Ambaldeston, of the Honour of Montgomery, by service of one knight's-fee ; but that now it (the service) was withdrawn, by the two daughters of the said Roger, which daughters were still holding the two Vills in question.\"11 I know from other evidences that, previous to this, Nicholas Meverel was deceased and that Lucia de Say, his Widow, had re- 8 Erdeswiclc's Staffordshire (Edition, 12 dorso. >\u00b0 Calendar, Vol. I. p. 49-b. \" Rot.

These estates were not re tained by the Bnrnels in demesne. They seem to have enfeoffed Corbet of Wattlesborough in the whole thereof.

I shall here mark only a few variations from that account, proper to Rowton. It appears that Robert de Budlers (Lord of Montgomery circa 1200) gave a virgate in Runton to Shrewsbury Abbey, and that the Abbey held the said land in 1255.3 At the Assizes of 1256, David ap Yagon failed to prosecute a suit of mort d'ancestre against Nicholas Meverel and others, con cerning half a virgate, less 2\\ acres, in Rueton. His sureties were Roger fitz William and Robert fitz Petronil, both of Eyton.4 At the Assizes of 1272, John le Marescall and Sibil his wife failed to prosecute their Writ de recto against Geoffrey de Forde for a.mes suage and 16 acres in Ruton, and against Mabil fitz David of Al berbury for 16 acres, also in Ruton. The sureties de prosequendo, viz. Hugh Hager and Roger Burnell, were excused amercement at the instance of Thomas Corbett.5 By a Fine of November 18, 1272, Walter de Aylesbury and Lucia his wife grant to Henry de Bray a carucate in Rutone, whereof was plea of ivarranty. The Grantee gives 100 merks. He is to hold in-fee, paying a clove rent to Walter and Lucia, and the heirs of Lucia, and performing all services due to the Lords of the Fee. Salomon de * * * (Roffa, I think) is said to ' appose his claim to this Fine. It is probable that this Fine left Walter de Aylesbury and his wife with a merely nominal interest in Rowton and Amaston. We have seen however that Walter de Aylesbury was still held responsible in 1280 for a share of the services due to Milisent la Zouche. The Feodary of 1284 mentions John le Poer only, as Lord of Ruton. He held it of Milisent la Zouche by service of finding two footmen in time of war, for 40 days, at his own cost. How Robert Burnell, Bishop of Bath and Wells, obtained pos- session of Rowton I cannot say. The Inquest, taken December 10, 1292, after his death, states him to have held Routon in capite of the King, by Serjeantry of providing two archers at Montgomery 'Castle in time of war. A messuage and small garden, worth 2s. per annum ; a virgate and half of land, worth 30s. ; an acre of meadow, worth 2s. ; the easements (pasturage and firewood) of a 5 Assizes, 56 Hen.

On June 17, 1294, when the King's Bailiff seized a moiety of the Manor of Ruton, in satisfaction of Philip Burnel's debts to certain Merchants of Lucca, the said moiety was calculated to pro duce \u00a33. 6s. 3\\d. per annum. At Philip's death, nine days after, the Escheator seems to have seized the whole Manor and to have ousted the Merchant's Attorney ; but the latter was reinstated by a Writ Royal of July 30, following. Philip Burnel's mortgages, for such I presume was the nature of his debts, were probably paid off during the minority of his heir. I shall mention more fully, under Ford, an Inquest taken on the death of Roger de Forde in 1317. He was found to have held (inter alia) a bosc in the Manor of Ruton, called Snodde. He had held it of the King in capite as of the Honour of Montgomery, without any service. He further had held three nokates in Ruton of the Abbot of Shrewsbury, by a rent of Is. 2d. Lastly, he had held 3 nokates in Ruton under William la Zouche, who had the rights of wardship and of marriage of the heirs of the deceased, by the terms of this tenure.7 So then, the Burnells were by no means seized of the whole of Rowton, though they and their Feoffees doubtless had the greater part of the Manor. Sent&alL This was another Manor held by Alward fitz Elmund of the Norman Earl. Domesday describes it thus. \u2014 \u25a0 \" The same (son of Elmund) holds Benehale.

Now it is worth 5s.\"1 Elm\u0153r, the Saxon of Edward the Confessor's time, was probably identical with Elmar, Lord of part of Eyton at the same period. Again, Alward fitz Elmund, Domesday Lord of Benehale, was also Lord of Rowton. These considerations seem to support our iden tification of Benehale with Benthall ; for Benthall, Eyton, and Row ton are contiguous estates or townships. Another consideration is not so favourable to this identification, for we expect to find any Manor of Alward fitz Elmund subsequently annexed to the Honour of Montgomery. This however is not the case here. The only conclusion is that King Henry I., having Alward's Manors in hand as an Escheat, did not annex them all to the said Honour, . but finding one of them, Benehale, adjacent to the Royal Manor of Ford, annexed it thereto. Of Benthall, except as a member of Ford, we consequently hear nothing after Domesday. It will re cur to us hereafter in that condition. Parochially, Benthall is a member of Alberbury, and in this respect it differs from all other manorial Members of Ford. The latter are and have ever been in Pontesbury Parish. This excep tional status of Benthall proves beyond a doubt its identity with the Benehale of Domesday. -PoU, Domesday notices this Manor between Rowton and Benthall. \u2014 \"The same (Alward, son of Elmund) holds Pole (of the Earl), and Ordmer (holds it) of him.

We find no such place as Pole in either neighbourhood. Here therefore I must resort to a mere conjecture, and identify Pole with Polmere, after wards a member of the Manor of Ford. The analogy of Benthall wdl then supply the further history of Pole, viz. that on the for feiture of Alward and his Tenant Ordmer, Pole was annexed to the Royal demesnes at Ford, not to the Fee of Montgomery. If Pole thus became Polmere and a member of Ford, we shall hear of it again in that condition. If it had any other destination, I am unable to trace it, and am therefore incompetent to speak about its history. Sort. Domesday gives the following account of this important Manor. \u2014 \"The Earl himself holds Forde. Earl Edwin held it (in Saxon times) together with fourteen Berewicks. Here are xv hides.

The fourteenth Berewick may have been Nox or Pansom. The Manor on the Forfeiture of the Norman Earls devolved to Henry I., who, as I have suggested, added thereto the small adjacent Manors of Benthall and Polmere. The whole continued an estate of Royal demesne till after the accession of Henry IL, who, in the year 1155-6 granted it to his Uncle, Reginald Earl of Cornwall. At the time of this grant, Ford was reputed to pay an annual ferm of \u00a35. 13s. 4<d. to the Royal Exchequer. From the year 1156 to 1 Domesday, so. 253, b, 2."], [205, "181 FORD the year 1175 inclusive, the Sheriff of Shropshire deducts that sum from his own annual liabilities, and assigns it under the head of Terr\u00e6 dat\u00e6 to Earl Reginald. Reginald, surnamed de Dunstanvill, was son of Henry I. by Sibil, daughter and, in her issue, coheir of Robert Corbet of Long den. I suppose him to have been born between the years 1110 and 1115, but need not recapitulate the somewhat conflicting evidence which bears upon that question. He and his Sister Gundred already held lands in Wiltshire, in 1130. In March 1136, I find him in the Court of the Usurper, Stephen, under the name of \" Reginald, son of King Henry.\"2 In 1138 Reginald de Dunstanvill appeared in arms in Coutance. Backed by Baldwin de Redvers (afterwards Earl of Devon), he seems to have materially aided the cause of the Empress in that quarter.3 Returning into England, he leagued himself with William fitz Richard, a great Cornish Feudatory, who in 1140 began to oppose the usurpation of Stephen.4 By marriage with this Baron's daughter and heir, Reginald de Dunstanvill ac quired a great Fief in Cornwall. In the same year, and apparently with reference to these circumstances, the Earldom of Cornwall was conferred upon Reginald de Dunstanvill by the provident Council of Robert, Earl of Gloucester, his half-brother, on whose wisdom and energy the cause of the Empress was mainly dependent. The Author of the Gesta Stephani, a strong partisan, tells us of the sacrileges of Earl Reginald, of his excommunication by the Bishop of Exeter, and how, in his estate as a husband and a father, he was visited with domestic misfortunes, too horrible for repetition or in vestigation here. The monastic mind was ever prone to identify and point out the specific judgments of heaven on reputed acts of wickedness ; but in seasons of personal fear and political hatred, no vengeance was too appalling for the cloistered ascetic to imagine and to portray, as levelled against the Chiefs of a hostile party. That Earl Reginald during the war of succession recognized the associations which bound him by birth at least, if not yet by interest, to Shropshire, is evident. In the year of the Empress's prosperity (1141) we see him attesting her Charters to the Abbeys of Shrews bury and Haughmond. In the summer of 1155 he accompanied his young Nephew, now King Henry IL, to the siege of Bridgnorth.5 That the King should grant a Shropshire Manor like Ford to this Earl of the far- west is after all no irrelevant circumstance. Ford 2 Liber Niger, II. 808. 3 Ordericus, p. 915. 4 Gesta Regis Stephani, p. 950. 5 Supra, Vol. I. p. 250."], [206, "182 FORD stood very centrally in regard to the bulk of Robert fitz Corbet's Domesday Manors, and these, we have every reason to believe, were held, in seigneury at least, by Earl Reginald for his life. The Pipe- Roll of 1156 shows Earl Reginald as Grantee of Crown-lands in Shropshire of the value of \u00a35. 13s. 4c.. per annum. This we know to have been in effect a recognition of his title to the Manor of Ford, and subsequent Pipe-Rolls state categorically that Ford was the Manor represented by that fiscal value. The same Pipe-Roll of 1156 exhibits the Earl with estates in Wdtshire, Northampton shire, Devonshire, and Herefordshire, in each of which Counties he was excused his quota of Danegeld. In Somersetshire, Dorset shire, and Devonshire he had had recent grants of Crown-lands, to say nothing of his Cornish estates, fiscally reputed to be worth \u00a3122. 10s. per annum. His mother was still living, and had lands or revenues in Wiltshire and Sussex, the latter acquired by a recent grant of Henry II. But I must adhere more particularly to his connection with Shropshire. In 1158 he was excused 14s. 2d. of a Donum then collected in that County. In 1160 he was excused his proportion (\u00a31. 7s.) of another donum assessed on the same County. In 1162 he was excused his proportion (\u00a33. 6s.) of the Danegeld of Shrop shire. In 1167, Earl Reginald's Manor of Alcester (Warwickshire) is described as his, and is amerced 1 merk by the Justice of the Forest. He died about December 1175, if we accept the date given by Benedictus Abbas, but on July 1, 1175, if we take the date of Diceto. The Pipe-Roll would make his death to have been about the end of April, for at Michaelmas 1175, a sum of \u00a32. 7s., or about five months' ferm of Ford, was accruing to the Crown, the Manor \" having returned into the King's hand at the death of Earl Reginald.\" I am spared any investigation of that difficult question, the num ber of Earl Reginald's legitimate children, by the fact that none of his descendants asserted any claim on his Shropshire estates, whe ther at Ford, or in Robert Corbet's Barony. Ford continued for years in the Crown, the Sheriff increasing the Firma Comitatus by \u00a351. 13s. 4d. ; \u2014 the reputed annual value of the Manor. In 1185 we have Aluric Provost (i. e. Steward) of Forde, amerced 6s. 8d for false clamour. In 1197 John le Strange was amonir the most active of the Lords Marchers. He had in fact the custody of Pole Castle (now Powis Castle) on behalf the Crown. From the Shropshire Pipe-Roll of that year it appears that Archbishop Hu-"], [207, "183 FORD bert had, about Midsummer, made to John le Strange a grant of 10 Librates of land in Ford ; but the grant took no effect, and the Sheriff, in lieu of the first quarter's income, pays 50s. in money to the said John. The year 1215 has usually been assigned as that in which Lewellyn ap Jorwerth surprised and occupied Shrewsbury. Previously how ever to this, the Welsh incursions must have been carried far and boldly over the Border. In the Pipe-Roll for the two years ending Michaelmas 1214, the Sheriff reckons an aggregate loss of \u00a330. on the Ferm of Forde \u2014 propter combustionem per guerram Walensium. Nothing but wholesale destruction by fire and sword can here be alluded to. Ford was among those Royal Manors, which, in the early years of Henry III.'s reign, cost so much more, than they produced for the revenue of the Crown.6 At the Assizes of 1221 the Vill of Forde appeared by a Provost and Jury of six men ; \u2014 a proof of that independent Jurisdiction of which we have an indication on the earlier Assize-Roll of 1203. Thus, though Ford was the Caput of a Hundred, the Manor itself was extra-hundredal. I have elsewhere classified the Tallages which were assessed upon Ford in the reigns of Henry IL, Richard I., John, and Henry III.7 A reference to that synopsis will show, that Henry II. took tallage from the Manor, even while it was in Earl Reginald's hands. This reservation was a common one, especially where, as in this case, the Manor was only granted for Use. The tallage of 1214 is extraordinarily high when we look at the circumstances of the dis trict. That of 1227, which appears on the Table as \u00a36. 13s. Ad., was originally \u00a312., but had been reduced by a special Writ of King Henry III.8 The Tallage of 1230 was the last which the Crown ever received from Ford. The cause will presently appear. At this time a name was growing in repute, in Shropshire and Staffordshire, which had been almost unknown to the aristocracy of the twelfth century. \u2014 Henry de Audley, whose loyalty and zeal had been tested in the reign of John, was of a Staffordshire family, of knightly degree, and nothing more. His genius, fostered in the Court of Ranulph Blundevill, Earl of Chester, could not remain unnoticed by Henry III., whose obligations to the Earl were of no ordinary character. 6 Supra, Vol. III. p. 69. 8 Claus. II. 184. \" Supra, Vol. VI. p. 11."], [208, "184 FORD Thus much I say here of the antecedents of Henry de Audley, who, at the time whereof I am now to speak, was amassing a Barony. On June 22, 1229, at which time Henry de Audley was Sheriff of Shropshire and Staffordshire, the King ratifies, by Patent, a Perambulation which he and William fitz Warin had been com missioned to make between the Woods of Montgomery and Kery. A Patent of November 7, 1229, gives Henry de Audley formal custody of the Counties of Salop and Stafford, with the Castles of Salop and Brug. This must be taken as a renewal of an existing trust. Leaving his Shrivalties to Deputies, Henry de Audley is found at Portsmouth on April 20, 1230, ready to accompany the King into Brittany. The Patent of protection which ensured the integrity of his estates while absent, extends to a number of names, more or less connected with Shropshire. On the list are John fitz Alan, John le Strange, William de Cantilupe, Senior and Junior, Walter de Dunstanvill, Herbert fitz Matthew, Ranulph Brito, Ro ger Anglicus, and others, whom I have mentioned elsewhere. On August 5, 1230, the King, then at Bordeaux, grants to his faithful and beloved Henry de Aldithele, the Manor of Ford, with its appurtenances : \u2014 to hold in fee-farm, of the King and his heirs, to the Grantee and his heirs, for an annual rent of \u00a312., payable at the Exchequer, in lieu of all services. The Grantee is to be quit of Suits to County or Hundred, and his men are to be quit of all tal lage, for the King's use ; but the Grantee may talliate the Manor for his own use, as often as the King talliated the Royal demesnes.9 At Michaelmas 1230, Henry de Audley accounted on the Pipe- Roll for \u00a312., iheferm of the Manor of Ford, and was quit. The Pipe- Rolls of subsequent years contain this account, with no mate rial variation ; but it is remarkable that, for ten years and more, the ordinary fiscal value of Ford (viz. \u00a35. 13s. 4sd.) was not deducted from the Corpus Comitatus. During that interval therefore, the Sheriff was a yearly loser of the latter revenue, for he accounted at the Exchequer as though he had received it, while in fact, and as Sheriff, his concern with Ford was at an end.10 At Worcester, on June 13, 1233, Henry de Audley was one of the Barons Marchers who had to give the King hostages, in gua rantee of their fealty, till the Realm should be at peace. He gave Ranulph his Son, whom the King committed to the custody of Hugh Despenser.11 3 Cart\u0153 Antiques, E.P. 7.

A Patent of December 19, 1233, appoints Henry de Audley (now no longer Sheriff) to be Custos of the Town of Shrewsbury, in place of the Earl of Lincoln. A Patent of June 15, 1237, desires Henry de Audley to make residence in the parts of Cheshire, in place of John, Earl of Chester, lately deceased, and for the conservancy of those parts. On March 9, 1238, Henry de Audley is one of the Justiciars appointed to inquire into, and amend, certain breaches of the truce with Lewellyn. His commissions as a Lord Marcher are so numerous, that I am content to state their essence, viz. that they constitute a mass of testimony to his skill as a Diplomatist, and his loyalty as a subject. On the 19th of November, 1246, this pros perous and, I think I may add, great man, being deceased, the King received the homage of \u2014 James de Audley, his son and heir, and gave orders to the She riff of Salop and Staffordshire, to take security for his relief, and to give him seizin of all the lands, Castles, and tenements of his late Father.12 In 1253, James de Audley obtained a Charter of Free -Warren for extensive estates in Staffordshire, Shropshire, and other Coun ties. The Manor of Fordes was among them. Some presentments of the Jurors of Ford Manor at the Inquest of 1255 are so supported by other evidence, that we must take the whole of their statements for true. We may thus learn the enor- mous profits which a Sheriff got as Fermor of a County, and also what was the net value of a grant in Fee-farm in the particular instance of Ford. The Jurors said that \" King Henry III., at his first transfretation into Brittany, gave the Manor of Forde to Sir Henry de Audley, then Sheriff of Salop ; and that the Manor at that time paid \u00a330. per annum to the King at four different terms.\" The meaning of this is that the Sheriff got \u00a330. a year from the community of Ford as the rent of their Manor. What the Sheriff forwarded to the Exchequer was \u00a35. 13s. 4d. The difference there- fore (\u00a324. 6s. Sd.) was his own, except that out of these profits on Manors he had to pay an annual Fine, or composition, called the Proficuum Comitatus. \" Henry de Audley,\" continued the Jurors, \" set the Manor at ferm to the men, or community, of the Manor, but at a rent of \u00a360. per annum, payable half-yearly to himself. This arrangement was still continued by James de Audley.\" So the Audleys, paying a fee-farm-rent of \u00a312. to the Crown, must have realized \u00a348. per 12 Rot. Finium, II. 2. vn. 24"], [210, "186 FORD annum by thus reletting the Manor. But besides this, \" Henry de Audley had taken 34 merks from the Manor within sixteen years.\" It will be found that, between the years 1231 and 1246 inclusive, exactly three tallages were levied on the King's demesnes. \" Sir James de Audley,\" added the Jurors, \" had taken 55 merks in tal lages within the last nine years.\"13 These Jurors further expressed, in language very unusual to such bodies, their annoyance at the destruction of a grand feature of their Manor. \" King Henry,\" they said, \" had a certain fair wood, large in extent, and perfect in condition, within the Manor. Now, Richard Pride, a Shrewsbury Burgess, had, by license of James de Audley, entered the said wood, and made havoc thereof, felling 1000 oak-trees and more. Also, James de Audley had caused a smaller wood, called Serthul, to be assarted, and had put an annual rent of 5s. on the land thus gained.\" Lastly, these Jurors men tioned the King's recent Charter of Free- Warren in Ford, to James de Audley. A Patent of July 31, 1258, addresses James de Audley after Peter de Montfort, then Sheriff. Audley was a Loyalist ; Mont fort's name is enough to declare what he was. The matter on which they were addressed was trivial in itself (it was a license to enable the Preaching Friars of Shrewsbury to turn a road), but it shows that the King distrusted Montfort, who had been in fact thrust upon his choice as Sheriff, by the Mad Parliament. In less than two years Audley was appointed Sheriff in Montfort's room. Some particulars of his conduct in that office, and during the whole period which followed, till the Battle of Evesham tranquillized the kingdom in 1265, have been sketched in a former Volume.14 For other events of his life I may refer to a still fuller Biography.16 The following notes relate to his position as a Baron Marcher. In the second month of his Shrievalty, viz. on June 29, 1260, he was \" with the King on the King's affairs at Westminster.\" On October 26, the King grants him an annuity of \u00a340., tdl an equi valent in Wardships or Escheats should be provided. In November, James de Audley is again at Westminster. He was suing Fulk fitz Warin in the Curia Regis for the following alleged outrage. The said Fulk, with Griffin ap Wenunwen and John le Strange, Senior, had, on the 29th of June above mentioned, and during Audley's absence at Court, sent certain Welshmen, under Griffin Seys and Griffin ap Owen, to Audley's vill of Forde. The said 13 Rot. Hundred. II. 66. ,5 DugdaWs Baronage, I. 747. 14 Supra, Vol. I. pp. 280-286."], [211, "187 BARONY OF AUDLEY. vill, with two other adjacent vills, the Welshmen had burnt; they had slain eight men, wounded ten to death, and led away ten prisoners. They had taken off a prey of 260 oxen and cows, 80 sheep, and 57 horses. Fitz Warin had been previously sum moned to appear on July 26, but had neglected to do so, and was now again a defaulter. Him the Sheriff of Shropshire was ordered to distrain for appearance on February 3, 1261. The same day was given to John le Strange, Senior, and Griffin ap Wenunwen, against whom there was a separate process. Such were the suspicions and feuds which divided the Royalists at that critical period, for this quarrel was no political one. The elder Le Strange and Fulk fitz Warin were soon afterwards found among the ranks of those who stood for the Crown, though the Welshman, Griffin, adhered to the opposite party. In 1261, James de Audley was excused by the King an amercement of 100 merks which had been set upon him by Justices Itinerant in Bucking hamshire. It was for unjustly detaining certain cattle. I have spoken of Henry III.'s Letters, written from Amiens on July 22, 1263, when the King had heard a report of Lewellyn's death. One of these Letters was to James de Audley, urging him to prevail on Griffin de Bromfield, who had married Audley's sister, to oppose the apprehended claims of Prince David to the sceptre of North Wales.16 On May 13, 1364 (it was the eve of the disas trous day of Lewes), a Patent gives the custody of the lands and heir of John, son of Robert de Beauchamp, to James d' Audley, the said heir having married Audley's daughter Joan.17 In the Pseudo- Patents, which are marked by the duration of the King's captivity, James de Audley's name is usually associated with Roger de Morti mer's of Wigmore and Hamo le Strange's. At this period an invitation to Court or a promise of safe- conduct is a sure mark of the steadfast loyalty of the Patentee. But I do not observe that Montfort's gracious invitations to certain Barons Marchers to retire to Ireland were extended to Audley. A Patent of Protection for the Crucesignati, dated May 21, 1270, includes the name of James de Audley. It is hence inferred (by Dugdale) that Audley went on the Crusade of that period ; but the premises are too slight to warrant such a conclusion. A Monas tic Chronicle dates his death in 1272 (when the Crusaders had not 16 F\u0153dera 1.420. James de Audley were campaigning against \" Dugdale says that at the time of the Lewellyn, and only heard of that event. Battle of Lewes, Roger de Mortimer and Audley surely witnessed it."], [212, "188 FORD returned), and ascribes it to a cause by no means associable with Oriental Romance, viz. a broken neck.18 Certain it is that King Henry III., on July 29, 1272, knew of the recent decease of James de Audley, and accepted the homage of \u2014 James de Audley (II.) , his son and heir, who forthwith had livery of his inheritance on the usual conditions.19 A precaution was likewise taken by the King for securing the dower of his de ceased servant's widow. On November 22, 1273, James de Audley (II) had followed his father to the grave. The Inquisition of his Shropshire estates values Edgmond, Ford, Marchumley, and Wes ton (under Red Castle) as yielding collectively \u00a3107. 14s. 6|rf. per annum. His brother Henry was his heir, and was at the time of the Inquest more than 22 years of age.20 On January 16, 1274, the Escheator is ordered to assign. 100 Librates of land to Matilda, widow of this second James de Audley, till such time as her dower should be fully allotted. The Manor of Ford, with other lands in Staffordshire, was found to constitute the prescribed income, viz. \u00a3100. 8s. 4d. She soon remarried with John d'Eivill, but the ultimate settlement of her dowry did not include the whole of Ford. Henry de Audley (II.) , succeeding his brother in November 1273, was accordingly Lord of Ford in November 1274, when the Jurors of the Manor gave, with the minutest accuracy, an account of its descent from the first Henry de Audley, and of the terms on which it was held in capite. These Jurors complained of extortions committed by the King's Officers ; \u2014 each one ever ready to make a private profit out of a temporary escheat. \u2014 John Baril, Undersheriff, had unjustly taken 4 merks from the men of the Manor on the decease of Sir James de Audley (James de Audley the first, is meant). On the same occa sion apparently, John fitz Aer, Subescheator, had seized the Manor into the King's hand, and had taken 10 merks from the men of the Manor, for whose use, no one knew.

An Inquest held at Shrewsbury on May 21 following, found him to have died seized of a third only of Ford, and valued the said third at \u00a325. per annum, less \u00a34., for the proportionate part of the Crown-rent due thereon. Eight days after the death of Henry de Audley, another third of Ford had accrued to his estate in consequence of the death of his Sister-in-law Matilda. The remaining third I conclude to have been in the hands of his Mother. William de Audley, brother and heir to the deceased, was found by the above Inquest to have been 22 years of age on October 18, 1275 .23 A Writ of July 19, 1276, summons William de Audley to be in attendance on the Quinzaine of Michaelmas following, when the King proposed to settle the dower of Lucia, his deceased brother's widow. On September 25th a Valuation of six members of Ford (viz. Egge, Poulmere, Newenham, Sibaldescote, Ardescote, and Lee) was probably in reference to this partition;23 which however, owing to the neglect of the Sheriff of Shropshire, had still to be made on May 5, 1278. A second Writ and Inquest followed, when the above six hamlets of Ford were found to produce \u00a325. 10s. 8d. per annum in assized rents, \u00a34. 13s. 4c.. per annum in Pleas and per quisites of Court, and 20c.. in the Pound added to every Tenant's rent, by way of Tallage, in such years as a King's tallage was levied.24 On December 28, 1282, King Edward, then at Rhuddlan, issued his Writ of Diem clausit on the death of William de Audley. The Inquest taken at Newport in January following, states that the deceased had held the Vitiate of Forde in capite, at a fee-farm rent of \u00a38. (not \u00a312.), and that its clear and annual value was \u00a344. 17s. lie/.25 From this I conclude that it was only two-thirds of Ford of which William died seized, and that the remaining third was held in dower either by his Mother, Ela, who was still living, or his Sister-in-law, Lucia. William de Audley fell, it seems, in the wars of Wales. Nicholas de Audley, his brother and next heir, was at this period more than 24 years of age. I have little to add to what Dugdale has said of Nicholas de Audley's career. His wife was Catherine Giffard, daughter and coheir of Matilda de Clifford, by her second husband John Giffard of Brimesfield.26 The King's 23 Inquisitions, 4 Edw. I., No. 50. 24 Inquisitions, 6 Edw.

The said Thomas while yet a youth was married to Eve, daughter and heir of John de Clavering. A Writ of January 16, 1308, announces that Thomas de Audley, son and heir of Nicholas, had died whilst in ward to the King. Ford was stated at the subsequent Inquest to be held at a fee-farm rent of \u00a312., and with its members, was extended at \u00a368. 4s. S\\d. per annum. The Jurors who took this Inquest at Red-Castle on Feb ruary 23, 1308, said that Nicholas, son of Nicholas de Audley (and therefore brother of Thomas) was next heir to Thomas, unless the wife of Thomas were enceinte. The said Nicholas was now 17 years of age.28 Nicholas de Audley (II.), who in due course succeeded his brother, is returned in the Nomina Villarum of March, 1316, as Lord of the Vill of Forde.29 He in turn was deceased on December 6 following. The Inquisition on his death values his interest in Edgmond, Newport, and Ford, at \u00a339. 16s. 6c.. per annum. He left a widow, Joan, and a son and heir, James, who was only 3 years of age on January 1, 1318. 30 This James, for whose career and descendants I must refer elsewhere,31 lived to the age of 71, and so was the first of seven successive heirs of this Barony who was not cut off in infancy, youth, or the flower of manhood. BEREWICKS OP FORD. Under this head I shall include all I have to say of the Tenants of this Manor ; for, in a close and privileged community like that of Ford, local details are seldom apparent except by accident. At the County Assizes the Manor was represented by its Provost and Jurors. The Roll of 1203 records none of the presentments of Ford, though it shows the Manor to have had its independent juris diction. The same may be said of the Assizes of 1221, though the Manor appeared by an unnamed Provost and six Jurors. 27 Inquisitions, 27 Edw. I., No. 46. 2S Inquisitions, 1 Edw.

During the minority of James de Audley (III.), that is on July 23, 1317, and June 12, 1319, two Writs of Diem clausit issued on the deaths of Roger de Forde and John, son of John Forde. Roger de Forde's tenure in Forde, under Audley's heir, was by service of 20s. rent. His son, Hugh, was 26 years of age on August 15, 1317. The same Hugh, son of Roger de Forde, was found by the Inquest of 1319, to be Uncle and heir of John, son of John de Forde, whose tenure under the Audleys was by a rent of 7s. 4c.. Hugh's age in this Inquest is said to have been 27 years at Mi chaelmas 1318.34 CHAPEL OP ST. MICHAEL, AT FORD. The whole of the Domesday Manor of Ford, except the township of Ford itself, and except a part of Little Hanwood (which was in the Parish of St. Mary's, Shrewsbury), was in the Parish of Pon tesbury. The Parish, therefore, which was attached to Ford Chapel, was merely the vill of Ford, and this Chapel was annexed, or subject, to the Chapel of St. Michael, in Shrewsbury Castle. The attempts made by the Rectors of St. Michael to obtain the tithes of Cruck ton and other townships of Ford Manor, have been already alluded to.36 The question was intrinsically one of ancient parochial bound ary, and the Rectors of St. Michael wished to extend the Parish of Ford at the expense of the Parish of Pontesbury. We see at this day that they never succeeded, for the Parish of Ford is still con fined to the single township of Ford, while the spiritual jurisdiction of the Church of St. George extends to every vill and acre of its original Parish. Ford Chapel, being annexed to St. Michael's, at Shrewsbury, was, of course, within the limits of that Royal Peculiar.

The Chapel is here valued at 100s.

Richard de Say was Incumbent of St. Michael's, Salop, in 1272. Adam de Dysiaco, or de Savarne, occurs in the same position in 1291 and 1292. The Assize-Roll of the latter year says, that the \" Chapel of Forde pertains to the Church of St. Julian's, Salop/* and is of the King's gift, and Master Adam de Dysyaco holds it by collation of the King.\" The Taxation of 1291 gives the Chapel of Forde as in Pontes bury Deanery and Hereford Diocese, and values it at \u00a3\\0. per an num.^ In 1296\u2014 Robert Herun, Parson of Forde, had King Edward's Letters of protection j44 and in 1297 similar letters were vouchsafed to \u2014 Robert de Cotingham, Parson of St. Michael's, Salop.45 Whe ther these two were identical, or whether Ford was really the place concerned in the first entry, are questions.

In 1341 Ford was not assessed to the Ninth as a distinct Parish. The Advowson of Ford Chapel seems to have gone with St. Michael's and St. Julian's to Battlefield College, founded and endowed by Henry IV. Hence in the Valor of 1535-6 the Master of Battlefield returns among his annual receipts a sum of \u00a33. 16s.

A very small portion thereof (one virgate) was held by Roger fitz Corbet, and was reputed to be in Bascherch Hundred. With this portion I have, strictly speaking, nothing here to do ; but I may say that it seems to have been annexed at some remote period to the larger share of the Manor, and, with it, to have fallen into the Liberties of Shrewsbury. There was, if I mistake not, another Manor (Charlton, near Shawbury) which Roger fitz Corbet shared with St. Alkmund's at Domesday, but in which his interest never subse quently recurs to notice. Of St. Alkmund's Manor of Preston, in Ruesset Hundred, Domes day speaks as follows. \u2014 \" The same Church held (in Saxon times) and still holds Prestune. Here is one hide, geldable.

Robert de Budlers or Boilers we know to have been Lord of Montgomery as early as 1176, and that he died in 1203. \" He, for the health of his soul and of the soul of his wife, Hillaria Trussebut, gave to Lilleshall Abbey all the land of Preston near the Bridge of Moneford, which land R. de Cota held.\"2 By ano ther Deed the same Robert de Budlers quit-claims to the Abbey the said Vill of Preston, \" acknowledging it to be the right and fee of St. Alkmund, confessing that he and his ancestors had un justly held it, and asking pardon from the Lord Jesus Christ for that sin.\"3 On August 31, 1199, King John, confirming the possessions of Lilleshall Abbey, names Preston juxta Moneford in the same cate gory with Dunthull (Dinthill) and other Manors, viz. as appurte nances of the Church of St. Alkmund.4 We next have the Abbot of Lilleshall buying up, for 2\\ merks, the dower in Preston, of Ysabel, widow of the above-named Tenant, Robert de Kotes. Her Deed expresses the sale to have been made in urgent necessity, but she reserves the right of Matilda her daugh ter, wife of William Pung, to a moiety of the said land after her own death. When Henry de Audley was Sheriff of Shropshire, that is about 1227-1232, Robert Hunger,6 being I suppose the Ab bot of Lilleshall's Tenant at Preston, used to do suit to County and Hundred for that Vill; but, the said Robert Hunger dying about 1235, the Abbot of Lilleshall entered on the Vill in virtue of the grant by Robert de Budlers of Montgomery, and withdrew Preston from the aforesaid suits, whereby, said the Jurors of Ford Hundred in 1255, the King had suffered a loss of 40s. (i. e. 2s. per annum during the period of withdrawal), unless the Abbot had some warranty.6 It appears from an undated entry in the Lilleshall Chartulary, that the Abbot was accustomed to pay, among other dues to the Crown, one shdling at Michaelmas in lieu of the suits of Preston and Dinthill to the Hundred-Court.7 Even in 1274, the Jurors of Ford Hundred remarked on Robert of his widow's release will have been later 2 \u2022 3 Lilleshall Chartulary, fos. 61, 55. 4 Rot.

At Michaelmas the Abbot received a ferm of 5s. 4d. from Dunthull, and 6s. llfrf. from Preston Moneford. At Midlent, the receipts were 5s. 4c?. and 7s. from the same places.9 The Nomina Villarum of 1316 gives the Abbot of Lilleshull as Lord of Preston and Dunthull. By an Inquest of September 1317 it appears that Roger de Forde, deceased (already mentioned under Rowton and Ford), had held a virgate in Preston-juxta-Moneford under the Abbot of Lilleshall at 3s. rent.

At the Assizes of 1203 we accordingly find John de Dunthull suing the Abbot, but under a Writ of novel disseizin, not of mort d'an cestre. The Abbot's objection (that the \" day given\" before the Justices itinerant was for a suit of mort d'ancestre) was fatal to the Plaintiff.3 John fitz Simon then seems to have proceeded with the latter suit, but here he was met by the objection that the Abbot against whom he had taken out the original Writ was dead.4 I find no more of this Suit. We have heard more than once of Giles de Norfolk, Clerk, a Portioner of Burford, and yet the Father of two daughters, and an accessary to a murder.5 He seems to have claimed something in Dinthill, for in September 1257 he has a writ of novel disseizin against William de Dunthull for a tenement in Dunthull.

Then, also, I shall hope to give some account of the Ferm and Jurisdiction of Brad ford Hundred, as a whole, and during the first two centuries of its corporate existence. I may here state that the name Bradford was derived from a vill in the Manor of High Ercall, which has long been destroyed. The caput of this vast Hundred having thus been a member of High Ercall, and High Ercall having been a seat of the New ports, the Newports very appropriately selected Bradford as the Title of their Earldom in the seventeenth century. In the annexed Table of Recordin Hundred, two liberties have been taken with the letter of Domesday. \u2014 1. The Manor of Cerlecote, which the Record places in Recordin Hundred,1 is not accounted so to have been. I have elsewhere identified it with Charlcott, and assigned it to its undoubted Hun dred, \u2014 Alnodestreu.3 2. The Manor of Cerletone, in respect of a hide thereof, which the Record places in Culvestan Hundred,3 is, as I have elsewhere explained, erroneously so placed.4, Charlton, near Shawbury (the Manor in question), is now lost, but was a divided Manor. Part of it was declaredly in Recordin Hundred. The other part (that which is misplaced in Domesday) was perhaps in Bascherch Hundred, which came up close to Shawbury. I have, however, preferred to consider both parts as in Recordin Hundred, because they were subsequently united in one Manor, and that Manor was probably in Bradford Hundred. In several instances I have found it more or less difficult to assign the Modern representatives of Recordin Manors. Such questions of identity I will discuss more fully under the Manors themselves.

Of the ten Manors, thus bestowed on one indivi dual, in one Hundred, Upton Magna was the largest ; and the his tory of Upton Magna happens to be so interwoven with the history of the early Sheriffs of Shropshire that I must needs take the two things in conjunction. Here manorial details become mere acces sories of a greater subject. We are to speak not so much of the ancient Lords of Upton Magna as of the \u2014 NORMAN SHEEIPFS OP SHBOPSHIEE. There is no institution in which the patrician genius of the Nor mans is so contrasted with the utilitarianism of the Anglo-Saxons as that of the Shrievalty. The Norman Vicomtes were provincial Ministers, nobly commissioned, highly trusted, and munificently rewarded. An English Sheriff fills an office as thankless as it is un laborious, as involuntary as it is irresponsible, \u2014 unless indeed it be accounted a responsibility that certain costs of executive administra tion should be periodically discharged by an individual. Again, as to the duration of office ; \u2014 the annual change of English Sheriffs is well known as a matter of the merest routine ; but the Vicomte of the Normans was the subject of no periodical appointment. It was not even limited to the life of an individual, but, with all its con tingencies of wealth and power, it descended to his heirs. Such was the Shrievalty which Roger de Montgomery, first Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, designed to found in Shropshire. Small likelihood was there indeed that the Earl would affect to remodel the Norman Institution. He himself was hereditary Vicomte of the Norman Oximin. Right competent to estimate the toils and to apportion the emoluments of such an office, he endowed the Shrievalty of Shropshire with a Fief which stamped its possessor at once, as the second man in the County; \u2014 as the genuine Vicecomes, or Prime Minister of the Comes. Besides several Manors in Sussex, War wickshire, and Staffordshire, more than seventy Manors in Shrop shire were thus attached to the Shrievalty of the last-named County. Warin, surnamed The Bald, first Norman Sheriff of Shropshire, was doubtless selected for that post on account of his qualifications. He was further honoured with the hand of the Earl's niece, Amieria. Ordericus, who as a boy must_ have frequently seen the Sheriff Warin, naturally describes his personal appearance with some mi nuteness, but speaks more generally of his reputed abilities and of the results of his administration. The Historian, describing the"], [234, "204 UPTON MAGNA. character and policy of the Earl, devotes but one sentence to his appointment of a Sheriff. Warino autem Calvo, corpore parvo, sed animo magno, Amieriam neptem suam, et pr\u0153sidatum Scrobesburi\u0153 dedit ; per quern Guallos aliosque sibi adversantes fortiter oppressit, et provinciam totam sibi commissam pacificavit.1 To extinguish the last struggles of Saxon nationality in the West, and to fasten the Borders of Shropshire up to and beyond the site of Montgomery ; \u2014 these were the results of Warm's lieutenancy, probably alluded to by Ordericus, and fully established by the testi mony of Domesday. A Charter of Earl Roger to St. Evroult of Uticum mentions Guarin Vicecomes among those Vassals of his, who had benefited that Monastery by grants in England and in Normandy. Ordericus, himself afterwards a Monk of Uticum, recites the Earl's Charter.3 We have further a Charter of William the Conqueror, to the same House of St. Evroul, which bears most directly on our present sub ject. It is dated at Winchester in 1081. Guarinus Vicecomes de Scrobesburia is one of its witnesses, and his specific grants to St. Evroul are enumerated. He had given Neuton to that House ; he had given the Church of Halis with the tithes of that Manor ; he had given the tithes of Guestona in Estafordescire ; \u2014 and these gifts, his Lord, Earl Hoger, had allowed.3 Again, when, on February 24, 1083, Earl Roger had made up his mind to the Foundation of Shrewsbury Abbey, he communicated his design to Guarin Vicecomes, to Picot de Sai, and to his other Nobles. The plan was approved of by all, and Guarin was in the same year actively assisting the first Monks of Shrewsbury in the construction of their Conventual Buildings.4 This too we learn from Ordericus, who at the very time was a school-boy in that Suburb of Shrewsbury now known as the Abbey Foregate. This truthful and earnest Historian tells us no more about Warin Vicecomes. What ever can be further collected on the subject must be looked for in the Chartulary of Shrewsbury Abbey, and in Domesday ; for if we listen to the statements of Dugdale and other writers, we shall be perplexed rather than enlightened. In fact Warin the Sheriff is to this day identified by many with Warin de Metz, the ancestor of the Fitz Warins, \u2014 a person who lived thirty years later, and whose Shropshire Fief, so far from involving the seventy Manors which 1 Ordericus (Paris Ed. 1855), Vol. II. I p. 220. 2 Ordericus (ut supra), p. 414. I 3 Ordericus (ut supra), III. pp. 19-29. 4 Ordericus (ut supra), III. 420, 421."], [235, "205 NORMAN SHERIFFS OF SHROPSHIRE. pertained to the Shrievalty, never comprehended a twentieth part of such a domain. In the year 1085 (the year in which Domesday was compiled) Warin the Sheriff was dead. His previous grant of Tugford to Shrewsbury Abbey has already been fully discussed.5 Of the only two passages in which Domesday makes direct mention of Warin, this passage which treats of Tugford is one. The Church and Tithes of Berrington constituted another of Warin' s alleged grants to Shrewsbury Abbey. This is confirmed, as 1 have shown under Berrington, by a series of Charters, and by the indirect evidence of Domesday. Earl Roger's Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey, passing within ten years of Warin's death, recites other grants of his to that House. These were the tithes of Oppeton (Upton Magna), \u2014 the Church and tithes of Mutla (Middle),\u2014 the Church and tithes of St. Oswald (usually supposed to be Oswestry), \u2014 and a house in the market place of the city (Shrewsbury), wherewith to provide lights to burn before the Altar of the Innocents (in the Abbey Church). These grants, if made by Warin, were probably of a testamentary character. Domesday corroborates no one of them, and other Charters of the Abbey assign them variously to Warin's successors ; \u2014 but all this does not determine the question of their truth, for Domesday does not necessarily speak of the appropriation of tithes or Churches, and we know that Charters, which were only confirmatory, often assumed the form of initiatory grants. Warin, at his death, left his wife, Amieria, surviving. He also left a son and heir, Hugh, and at least one other child. Hugh, son of Warin, was evidently a Minor at the time of Domesday, and Amieria having taken a second husband, Rainald, the latter appears in Domesday as Vicecomes of Shropshire, and as holding every Manor, whether in Shropshire or elsewhere, which pertained to that Honour. The question whether Rainald held the Shrievalty in jure uxoris or by appointment of the Earl, during the minority of Hugh, it is perhaps impossible to determine. The only recorded act of Amieria, during her short widowhood, is a grant to Shrews bury Abbey out of her dower, and not out of her fee. The inference from this would be, that she was not regarded as Vicomtesse of Shropshire in her own right, and so, that Rainald obtained the Honour independently of her. The grant in question was as follows. \u2014 \" After her husband's death, she gave for his soul a house which 5 Supra, Vol. IV. p. 80."], [236, "206 UPTON MAGNA. she had in Shrewsbury, of her own proper dower, her children con ceding the grant. She covenanted that she herself, living in the said house (as tenant to the Abbey), should provide candles (ceram) to light the Church through every night of the whole year.\" Rainald, second Sheriff of Shropshire, with whom my narrative should now proceed, has not been made the subject of any such unintentional mistakes as have befallen the history of his predeces sor. The truth is that the better class of Antiquaries have faded to discover who he really was, and so have been properly cautious as to what they said about him. On the other hand certain less wary and more ignorant Heralds, intent upon heading a genealogy with a good name, have fixed upon his without any apparent fear of de tection. I cannot regret being able to expose their presumption. \u2014 In the Norman Diocese of Seez, on the Eastern verge of the great Forest of Gouffern, was the Town of Oxim\u00e6 or Exmes, the caput of Roger de Montgomery's Vicomte of the Oximin. About ten miles North-west of Exmes, and within the Forest of Gouffern, was the Bourg of Bailleul, usually called Bailleul-en-Gouffern, to distin guish it from another Bailleul. About the same distance North-east of Exmes was the Monastery of St. Evroult-en-Ouche, or St. Ebrulf of Uticum, where Ordericus wrote his history and ended his days. Bailleul-en-Gouffern was a Fief which that Rainald, of whom we are speaking, held under Roger de Montgomery, when he was called to fill the more impor- tant position of Sheriff of Shropshire. The identity of Raynaldus Vicecomes of Domesday, with Renaud de Bailleul, being thus pre- mised, I proceed to give a chronological account of the individual in question. \u2014 He appears in the Shropshire Domesday, generally as Raynaldus Vicecomes, but in one or two instances he is called merely Rainaldus. Among the seventy Manors which are consecutively mentioned as in his tenure, Upton Magna was one. Domesday describes it as follows. \u2014 \" The same Rainaldus (Vicecomes) holds Uptune (of the Earl). Seuuard held it in the time of King Edward. Here are five hides, geldable. In demesne there are m ox-teams, and (there are) vn Serfs, xxv Villains, and one Free-man with xn ox-teams ; and vm teams might be here in addition. Here is a Mill of 16s.

Now it is worth \u00a37.\"e The Staffordshire Domesday, in one place, enters Rainaldus as 5 Domesday, fo. 254, b, 2."], [237, "207 NORMAN SHERIFFS OF SHROPSHIRE. holding three Manors under the Norman Earl of Shrewsbury. One of these Manors is Halas (now Sheriff Hales) , the very Manor whose Church and tithes we have seen given to St. Evroult of Uticum by Rainald' s predecessor, Warin. One line of the Domesday entry under Hales I must quote.\u2014\" In this Vill,\" says the Record, \" St. Ebrulf hath one ox-team ; with a Priest who has two oxen.\" 7 Another Chapter of the Staffordshire Domesday gives Rainald Bailgiole as holding four Manors, not of Earl Roger, but of the King, in capite? Two of these Manors are Westone and Niwetone, assuredly that very Gueston, whose tithes Warin Vicecomes has been shown to have granted to St. Evroult, and that very Neuton, which he is said to have granted wholly to that House. It is true that Domesday verifies neither of these grants, and we have other evidence that they never took effect, for Weston-under-Lizard and Newton, near Blithefield, continued for ages appurtenances of the Barony, held by Rainald's successors, and without any appearance of St. Ebrulf having an interest in either. The probability is that, though William the Conqueror's Charter of 1081 had allowed Warin's grants in Weston and Newton, they were disallowed before Domesday ; \u2014 for they had been allowed under the erroneous impres sion that these places were part of the Fief held by Warin under the Norman Earl (whose consent had been obtained), whereas they were held immediately of the King, whose consent to the primary grant had never been asked. Domesday further mentions three Manors in Sussex held by Rainaldus under Earl Roger.9 Of these I name one, viz. Stoches, with a view to a future question, rather than to any present re mark. In Warwickshire, Rainaldus held four Manors under the same Earl. It will be at present sufficient to name them. They were Stratone, Uluricetone, Leileforde, and Ulvestone.10 Immediately after Domesday we have Raynald Bailial, as his name is written, attesting an exchange between Earl Roger and Wenlock Priory.11 Within ten years after this, Earl Roger expedited his General Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey. Rainald's name is twice mentioned therein. As a witness, he follows Richard de Belmeis, but precedes are Stretton-super-Dunsmore, Woolston, Church Lawford, and Woolston (the lat ter being a divided Manor). 7 Domesday, so. 248, a, 1. 8 Ibidem, so. 250, b, 1. 9 Domesday, so. 24, b, 2. 1(1 Domesday, so. 239, a, 2.

As Reinald, brother of Guarin Vicecomes, the Charter mentions and confirms his grant of Lega (Lee, near Ellesmere) to the Abbey. Before I follow the different notices of Rainald in the Shrewsbury Chartulary, it will be better to state that where he is called Brother of Guarin, the term only means Brother-in-law, or rather, husband of Warin's Widow. Thus ,the Charter of King William IL, after enumerating Warin's grants in Tugford, Upton Magna, and Ber rington, adds, \u2014 Rainaldus frater ipsius Warini dedit eis villam qu\u0153 dicitur Lega. I have already denounced one of Earl Hugh's alleged Charters to Shrewsbury Abbey as a fabrication.12 Its falsity is nowhere more apparent than where it instances the following grants as if made out of the Earl's demesne, viz. decimam dominii de Optona (Upton Magna is meant), et de Prestona Supra (Preston-super-Severn, now Preston Boats, is meant), et decimam dominii de Oswaldestre (Os westry is meant), et de Nesse (Little Ness), et de Mulde (Middle). Earl Hugh's less suspicious Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey men tions (inter alia) two-thirds of the demesne tithes of Nesse and of Optone as having been given by Warin Vicecomes ; but this Char ter does not mention Rainald at all. Earl Hugh's undoubted Charter to the same Abbey is not con versant with territory or tithes, but one version of the document names the following among those who were present at the trans action. These were Richard de Belmeis, Rothbert Vicecomes (pro bably Robert fitz Tetbald, Sheriff of Sussex), Rainaldus Vicecomes, and Fulco Vicecomes (Under- Sheriff, I think, to Rainald). Henry I.'s Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey passed in 1121, but its retrospect of the grants of the Norman Sheriffs claims attention. It attributes to Warin Vicecomes grants, already noticed, in Tug ford and Berrington ; but adds, in reference to his other grant of the tithes of Obton, that the Church (meaning the original Church of St. Peter at Shrewsbury) had always had those tithes from the time of King Edward. To Rainadus, Warin's brother, this Charter further attributes the grant of Lega. Lastly, it says that \" Rainald, who, after the death of Warin, received the wife of Warin, together with his Honour, and Hugh, son of the same Warin, gave to the Abbey the Church of St. Oswald, the Church of Muthla, the tithes of Nesse, and the tithes of Seraordina ; \u2014 Earl Hugh conceding, and, with many others, giving his testimony to the said grant.\" The '- Supra, Vol. I. p. 33, note 12."], [239, "209 NORMAN SHERIFFS OF SHROPSHIRE. question as to who really originated all these grants, and the evi dence as to their permanence, will properly belong to the localities themselves. We have recited enough of them for our present pur pose, which is to show that Rainald de Bailleul remained during the time of Earl Hugh (1194-1198) the acknowledged Successor of Warin, but that, at the same time, the consent of Hugh, Warin's heir, was adhibited to Rainald's territorial dealings. I now recur to Normandy, where we find Earl Roger, between the years 1086 and 1094, expediting a Charter to St. Evroult of Uticum. The said Charter has this important passage. \u2014 \" More over I, for the love of God, concede the Altar of St. Leonard in the Church of Badol, and one part of the tithe of that vill, together with the land which Rainald de Bailal and Amieria his wife, my niece, have given by their proper gift.\" This Charter was cotem porarily signed by the Earl himself, and afterwards subscribed at Alencon by his sons Robert and Hugh; by Rodbert fitz Tedbald and his son Hugh ; by Hugh filius Turgini ; by Rainald de BaUlol himself j \u2014 and by William Pantulf;13 \u2014 all of whom are more or less associated with Shropshire History. It is extraordinary that Ordericus, who must have known every particular of Earl Robert de Belesme's rebellion in 1102, tells us nothing of the conduct or sympathies of the greatest of the Earl's Vassals, the Sheriff of Shropshire. This is still more extraordinary if we consider that Renaud de Baileul's Norman estates were not far distant from the Monastery of St. Evroult, where Ordericus was at the time domiciled. It is evident that this silence of Ordericus was not intended to shield the reputation of any partisan of Belesme, for the Earl himself is stigmatized, in no measured terms, by the Historian. The inference is, that the Sheriff took the safer but less conspicuous part, and sided with King Henry. This general con clusion, drawn from the silence of Ordericus, is backed by a parti cular inference drawn from the Welsh Chronicles, and which I have already discussed,1* viz. that Rayner, being the King's Lieutenant in Shropshire at the close of the year 1102, and, so after Belesme's expulsion, was then confidentially employed by Henry I. in the affairs of the Border. I have further given reasons for thinking that this was Reyner's (or Rainald's) last official act as Sheriff of Shropshire, and that his Shrievalty at once merged into the Vice royalty of Richard de Belmeis.15 The almost total absence of direct evidence obliges me to leave it I 14 * 16 Supra, Vol. II. pp. 193, 191 27 12 Ordericus, Vol. II. pp. 414, 415. VII."], [240, "210 UPTON MAGNA. a question as to how, or why, Rainald ceded his Shropshire Fief as well as his office. That he incurred no forfeiture is nearly certain ; that he was living many years after his connection with Shropshire had ceased, is still more clear. The only inference that remains, seems to be, that Hugh, son of Warin, was now (1102) old enough to succeed to his paternal inheritance, though not to the duties of his office. Again, one scrap of evidence is all that bears directly upon this complicated question. A monastic Charter tells us that a subsequent Sheriff \" received Warin's honour after Warm's son.\" We cannot escape the conclusion that Warin's son (probably Hugh) did at some time obtain livery of his Father's lands. I suppose then, on the whole, that this succession took place about 1102-3, and I infer, from subsequent events hereafter to be stated, that the said Hugh died very shortly, and without issue. I will, before I enter upon the question of Hugh fitz Warin's successor, relate what I have gathered of the ulterior career of Renaud de Baileul. The narrative of Ordericus supplies no in ternal means for dating a Norman expedition which he describes as having been undertaken by the Comte de Perche against the Moors of Spain.16 The most signal successes attended the Christian arms, and several persons, both Norman and French, decided upon settling in Spain ; \" but,\" says the Historian, \" Rainald de Bailol, and many others went back to their native land, preferring their hereditary possessions to foreign acquisitions.\" The marginal dates given in the best Edition of Ordericus would fix these events in the year 1114, but Mariana, the Spanish Historian, relates the events of, I think, this same Crusade with great minuteness, and unless there were two crusades, it would seem that the year 1118 was the true date of the Christian successes.17 It appears, from another passage of Ordericus, that in the Spring of 1119 the inhabitants of Curceium18 and the Oximin, opining that the Normans were generally favourable to the cause of the King's Nephew, the son of Courte-heuse, determined to espouse it. The King appears to have been at Falaise, and Rainald de Bailol at tendant at the Court. The King, suspecting his loyalty, seems to have demanded the surrender of his Castle or Stronghold, \u2014 Le Chateau Renouard.19 The Borderer gave a haughty refusal, renounced his 16 Ordericus, (ut supra), Vol. V. p. 7. >7 Historiade Espana (Ed. 1678), Tom. 19 Situated apparently in the Depart ment of Ome, Arrondissement of Argen tan, and Canton of Vimoutier.

The King had declined to take measures for his arrest whilst at Court, but as soon as he was gone, called out the Royal body-guard, and arrived that same even ing at Chateau Renouard, almost as soon as its Master. Next morning Rainald surrendered the Fortress (lapideam domum) with all its stores; and the King burnt it to the ground. The measure stifled the incipient rebellion of that district ; \u2014 but we hear no more of Renaud de Bailleul.20 This man, however, whose Fief, while yet he remained in England, was vast enough to grace any Earldom, \u2014 whose after-fame, as a Crusader, was of European rather than pro vincial stature, \u2014 whose prestige or whose pride was so great as that he dared to confront the ablest Monarch of the age in his own Court, \u2014 this man has received no better treatment at the hands of our Antiquaries and Heralds than that his name should figure at the head of two respectable county pedigrees.21 I here close my account of the Norman Sheriffs of Shropshire, but before I commence that of their Successors in land and office, I must once more mark the twofold distinction between the Sheriff in-fee and the Viceroy on the one hand, and the Sheriff- in-fee and the Deputy- Sheriff on the other. Thus, in the first ten years of the twelfth century we have the Viceroy, Belmeis, called Vicecomes, and we have the Deputy, Fulcuius, called Vicecomes ,* but the Sheriff-in fee was first Rainald, then perhaps Hugh son of Warin, and thirdly Alan fitz Flaald. These three, or at least the first and last of them, successively held the Sheriff's Fief, and were called Vicecomites, whatever may have been their official duties. Passing over Hugh son of Warin, of whom I have said all that I can learn, I must give a distinct Chapter to \u2014 ALAN FITZ FLAALD \u2014 as the next declared and evident occupant of the Fief which Rainald Vicecomes held at Domesday. The first question is as to who this Alan fitz Flaald was. That he was Progenitor not only of the great House of Fitz Alan, but of the Royal line of Stuart, is beyond doubt, but that fact constitutes per se no part of his own Lord of Weston, to have been Ancestor of the Westons of Weston-under- Lizard. Other Heraldic Pedigrees make Bainald, the Domesday Sheriff of Shropshire, to have been father of one Hugh de Le, and so Ancestor of the Lees of Lea Hall, Bo den, Langley, Coton, etc. 20 In the next generation, Hamelin e, ne phew of Baynald de Balloil. was a grantor to St. Evroult, and Bozceline de Baillol attests his grant.

However, Scottish Histories and English Legends de clare that the Stuarts were descended from Bauquo, Thane of Lochaber,\u2014 the victim of King Macbeth : and whereas the first Steward of Scotland, if not Alan fitz Flaald himself, was a son of Alan fitz Flaald, it follows either that Alan fitz Flaald was the said Banquo's descendant, or else that those declarations are false. Before I enter upon the intricate investigation which now pre sents itself, I must discharge the subject of certain previous mistakes, which if allowed to remain will encumber it with some such chrono logical difficulties as usually pave the way to wild conjecture and double error. \" In the time of William the Conqueror,\" says Dugdale, \" Alan, the son of Flathald (or Flaald), obtained by the gift of that king, the Castle of Oswaldster, with the territory adjoining, which be longed to Meredith ap Blethyn, a Britton.\" This statement seems to have been originally derived from the \" Fitz Warine Chronicle,\" which (purporting to give an account of William the Conqueror's visit to Wales and disposal of the Marches) says that the king \" came to a country joining to the White Laund\" (the district about Whittington is meant) \" which belonged formerly to a Briton, Meredus son of Beledins ; and besides it is a little castle which is called the Tree of Oswald ; but now it is called Osewal destre. The king called a knight, Alan Fitz Flaeu, and. gave him the little castle with all the honour appertaining to it ; and from this Alan came all the great lords of England who have the surname of Fitz Alan. Subsequently this Alan caused the castle to be much enlarged.\" 22 John Leland, abridging another version of this same metrical romance, says \u2014 \"Alane Fleilsonehad gyventohym Oswaldestre.\"33 The particulars thus asserted require some observation. \u2014 In the first place William the Conqueror's only visit to Wales was in a.d. 1081 ; \u2014 earlier rather than later. Domesday (compiled five years after that date) says not a word about Oswestry, under that name. It gives, however, a full account of all the manors in the district ; and a brief comparison with later documents will show that Rainald, Sheriff of Shropshire, was then holding all the lands in that quarter which were subsequently held by Fitz Alan. The Shropshire Domes day, moreover, makes no mention of Alan fitz Flaald, either under that or any similar name. There is, in short, no coeval mention of such a person in Shropshire till the reign of Henry I. -2 Fitz Warin Chronicle, pp. 13, 14. | 33 Collectanea, Vol. I. p. 261."], [243, "ALAN FITZ FLAALD. 213 In the next place Meredyth ap Blethyn, whose era one would fix from the above as earlier than the visit of William the Conqueror, was a Prince of North Wales at the very time. The death of his father, Blethyn ap Convyn, was in 1073. Meredyth did not suc ceed him as King of North Wales, nor as anything more than Prince of Powis Land. He died in 1133. Whether Madoc ap Meredyth, his son, is truly said by the Welsh Chronicles to have first built Oswestry Castle, in 1148, is a question on which I will not enter here. Dugdale further relates how \" Alan fitz Flaald married the daughter and heir of Warine, Sheriff of Shropshire, and had in her right the Barony of the said Warine.\" \u2014 That Alan fitz Flaald had Warine's barony is true, but that it was after the era of Rainald the Sheriff, Warine's successor, we have seen. Moreover, the documents to which Dugdale refers in proof of the alleged marriage, prove nothing of the kind. I discredit this supposed match altogether ; and for three reasons : \u2014 1st. Because it is nowhere authentically announced. 2ndly. Because, if it had taken place, there are authentic documents which traverse the very ground in which it would have constituted an important fact, and yet these documents say nothing about it. 3rdly. Because there are good reasons for thinking that Alan fitz Flaald's only wife was an other person ,than any supposed daughter of Warine, Sheriff of Shropshire. Another story has yet to be told and contradicted. The Fitz Alans held a considerable fief in Norfolk, the tenure of which was made matter of report by a provincial jury in the year 1275. These Jurors said that, \" Melam (Mileham) with its appurtenances, was in the hand of William the Bastard at the Conquest, and the said King gave the said manor to a certain knight, who was called Flan cus, who came with the said King into England ; and afterward the said manor (descended) from heir to heir till (it came) to John fitz Alan, now (1275) in the King's custody.\"2* There was, therefore, a Norfolk tradition, the counterpart of that current in Shropshire, except that it made Flancus, or Flaald, the feoffee of the Conqueror, and not his son Alan. We will examine this tradition by the same test as the last. The honour of Mileham, with its adjuncts, as subsequently held by Fitz Alan, is readily iden tified in the Norfolk Domesday. It had belonged to Archbishop 24 Rut. Hundred. I. 434. The Jurors I made a mistake as to the name of the I Minor then in custody. It was certainly Richard."], [244, "214 UPTON MAGNA. Stigand (deprived in 1070), and was then (1085-6) in the King's hand, William Noiers having custody thereof. Neither in Mdeham itself, nor in any of its adjuncts, does the name Flancus, or aught associable therewith, occur. After the completion of Domesday, William the Conqueror passed so little of his remaining life in England, that it would be idle to attribute his alleged feoffment of Flancus to that brief interval. Having now got rid of certain traditions about Flaald and his son Alan, as untrue in each essential particular, we pass to certain other traditions, which only relate to those persons by implication, which are also inaccurate in many points, but which may possibly contain a germ of truth well worth searching for. Shakespeare knew of a legend which made Banquo ancestor of the Stuarts. The story in his hands became a matter of world-wide fame. We attend first, therefore, to his, as to the most known ver sion thereof, and we must attend with caution. The fundamental study of the dramatist is the human mind, its motives, its workings, and its passions : \\i\\s art is to exhibit those principles in appropriate though imaginary action. With the historian it is otherwise. His knowledge should be primarily that of actions themselves; from these, well and honestly investigated, he will infer or suggest what were the characters and motives of the actors. When Shakespeare sought in a remote and obscure period of Scottish story the materials of a drama which was to exhibit, in one phase, his consummate knowledge of the human heart, no se condary considerations were suffered to interfere with his engrossing purpose. Among adjuncts altogether subsidiary to the main object, we trace rather the flattery of a courtier than the accuracy of an historian. Waiting on the smiles of royalty, Shakespeare was by no means careful to memorialize the circumstance that when Mac beth rebelled against and slew King Duncan, Banquo, Thane of Lochaber, was of Macbeth's party ; but Shakespeare did not omit another matter of tradition, viz. that this same Banquo was pro genitor of the Royal House which at length occupied the throne of England. The existence of this legend being established, Shake speare's personal belief therein, or particular use thereof, are no longer matters for our consideration. We proceed to present it in its other forms,26 accompanied by such external tests of date and circumstance as remain for our guidance. \u2014 25 For the best version of this tradition | I depend on the following authorities. \u2014 | Powel's History of Wales (Edition of 1811, page 73) contains an abstract"], [245, "215 ALAN FITZ FLAALD. Macbeth reigned in Scotland about seventeen years, viz. from 1039-40 to 1056-7. A date varying between the years 1048 and 1053 is assigned for the period when Macbeth, suspecting that cer tain of his subjects were plotting the restoration of Malcolm Can more, (eldest son of Duncan), endeavoured to fortify his throne by confiscations, imprisonments, and executions. Some nobles, more fortunate than the rest, fled the kingdom, 'and awaited in foreign countries the turn of events. Of those who perished by the axe or the dagger was probably Banquo, Thane of Lochaber ; of those who escaped, was Fleance, Banquo's son. He sought the protection of the king or prince of North Wales, \u2014 Trahern ap Caradoc, says one account ; Grufiyth ap Lewellyn, says another. We must adopt the latter, whose era (1037-1063) is entirely consistent with the facts above stated, whereas Trahern ap Caradoc did not succeed to the throne of North Wales till 1073, .. e. seventeen years after Mal colm Canmore had been restored to that of Scotland. As the guest then of Grufiyth ap Lewellyn, Fleance secretly be came either the husband or the paramour of his protector's daughter, a deception or a crime for which he atoned with his life. The issue of this alliance, doubly ill-fated if, as it is said, the Welsh princess died in prison, was a son whom I find called Walter in both versions of this tradition, but whom I shall here call only Son of Fleance. It does not appear where the Son of Fleance was brought up : it was \" in the country,\" says one authority, by which, I presume, is meant, not in the Welsh Court. He was, says the same authority, in his eighteenth year when some Welshman having insulted him with the supposed illegitimacy of his birth, he slew the over-curious genealogist, and was obliged to fly the country. Naturally enough he returned to Scotland, where Malcolm Canmore was at length reigning. The period of his return can be ascertained by a circum stance given. It was, says the legend, at the time when \"Queen Margaret, sister of Edgar Atheling, sought refuge there with many thereof, compiled apparently from Ho linshed and from the Scotch historians, Hector Boece and George Buchanan, who both wrote in the first half of the by Wharton in the Anglia Sacra (Vol. I. p. 686). The author, who was really a Stuart, surrendered Ely Priory Nov. 18, 1539, and being a great promoter of the Dissolution, was appointed dean of the same cathedral by Henry VIII. on Sept. 10, 1541. He died Dec. 23, 1557. Among the armorial insignia attached to this genealogy, is the ancient Stuart coat \u2014 Arg. afesse cheque, az. and arg. XVIth century. Eobert Wells, alias Stewarde, last Prior and first Dean of Ely, being a vain man (homo ventosus) and proud of his ancestry, compiled in the year 1522, a genealogy of the Stuarts. It is printed"], [246, "216 UPTON MAGNA. English.\" Though Margaret's royalty is here somewhat antici pated, the event alluded to, and its date, are obvious enough. It was in the summer of 1067 that Edgar Atheling, his mother, and two sisters, with many Saxons, left England to the triumphant Nor man, and placed themselves under the protection. of Malcolm, who soon afterwards married Margaret, the elder of the said sisters. The Son of Fleance then, born about 1050, and returning to Scotland in 1067, is said to have soon distinguished himself in the service of Malcolm, who knighted him, gave him lands, and made him Seneschal, or Steward, of Scotland.\u2014 Of the which office, says one authority,26 he and Ms posteritie reteined that sername of Steivard ever after, from whom descended the most noble kings of Scotland of the family of Stewards, besides many other Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, and Barons, of great fame and renowne. My second authority, after a similar flourish, ends his account of the son of Fleance, whom he calls Walter throughout, by saying that he died about the forty-second year of his age (constructively then about 1091), and left a son Alan.27 \" Alan Seneschal, or Stuart,\" continues this writer, \" was also a famous knight. He performed great things in the Holy Land un der the standard of Godfrey of Bouillon\" (the crusade of 1096 1099 must be here intended). \" He demeaned himself bravely against Stephen, King of England, at Abarton.\" (The battle of Alverton, otherwise called the Battle of the Standard, must be the event alluded to. It was fought on August 22, 1138. No Alan of this family can have been present thereat.) The same writer pro ceeds to give Alan a son, Alexander, whom he makes to have been founder of Paisley; but we happen to know that Paisley was founded in or about 1163, by Walter Fitz Alan, Steward of Scot land, whom this author altogether excludes from his proper place in the genealogy. In fact the known descent of the earlier Stuarts is quite irreconcilable with this part of the account which I have quoted, and which we may here dismiss, having better authorities to depend upon than those which, at the best, were merely le gendary. Before, however, we can compare the Scottish legends with the English accounts of the origin of the Stuarts, the latter must be collected and arranged, for at present they exist in only a frag mentary form. To this business I now address myself. \u2014 26 Powel, ut supra. | 2'\" Eobert Stewarde, ut supra."], [247, "ALAN FITZ FLAALD. 217 It is well known how Henry I. endeavoured to strengthen his hold on a sceptre, to which his title was doubtful. His uniform policy was to create a new aristocracy, unconnected with that older one with which Domesday acquaints us. This policy had a double result. It secured to himself, and his daughter after him, the steadfast loyalty of a small but able band of chieftains ; but it alienated the affections of the nobility created by his father, which underrated the new favourites, and in the sequel adhered generally to the usurper Stephen. Further, it is not probable, nay in some instances we know the contrary, that Henry selected his favourites from among the Nor mans. Foreigners, or men whose origin was unknown or problema tical, were preferred. Such, in Shropshire, were Warin de Metz, a Lorrainer, the three Peverels, and, greatest of all, Alan son of Flaald. King Henry had occupied the throne of England about three months, when (on Nov. 11, 1100) Matilda, daughter of that Mal colm and Margaret, of whom we have spoken, became his queen. The first mention which I can find of Alan Fitz Flaald belongs, to the year following. On September 3, 1101, the King was holding a great court at Windsor. A charter, which he granted to Herbert, Bishop of Norwich, is attested by Alan Fitz Flaald (whose name, however, is printed as Alan Fitz Harold). The charter designates the witnesses as the \"illustrious of England, ecclesiastical and secular,\" and the list (headed by Queen Matilda) warrants the de scription. Alan Fitz Harold's name occupies no mean position thereon. It stands before those of Gilbert and Roger Fitz Richard, of Robert Malet, and of Herbert, the King's chamberlain.28 The charter by which Herbert, Bishop of Norwich, founded the cathedral priory of his See, passed on this same occasion. It. is attested by the King and Queen, and by a set of witnesses who nearly all appear in the King's charter. Among the rest, Alan Fitz Flaald is a subscriber. But this charter contains something still more to our purpose. It confirms the \" Church of Langham, which had been Alan's, and his (Alan's) tithes.\"29 Now Langham was afterwards a recognized member of Fitz-Alan's Honour of Mileham, from which it was not far distant. Summarily, then, we conclude that Alan Fitz Flaald had acquired a part of his Norfolk fief before September 1101, and had already granted a church and tithes therein towards the endowment of Norwich Priory. 29 Monasticon, IV. 17, No. Ill, 28 28 Monasticon, IV. 17, No. V. | VII."], [248, "218 UPTON MAGNA. Continuing to investigate Alan Fitz Flaald's connection with Norfolk, I should point out that Henry I. seems to have been seized in demesne of the Manor of Eaton. Eaton was near Norwich, and so not a member of Mileham. This manor the King gave to Alan Fitz Flaald, and Alan transferred it to Norwich Priory, apparently before November 1109; for that I take to be the date of a charter, whereby Henry I. gives to the said Priory \" his (the King's) Manor of Eaton, which Alan Fitz Flahald had before given thereto ; and this, -with soe and sac and other customs, as the manor was when in the King's demesne.\" \" And hereof,\" says the King, \" I will con firm unto them (the monks) a charter, when Alan shall come to my court.\"30 I suppose the King was waiting for some fuller information as to the grant before he gave it a more formal sanction. Alan Fitz Flaald's interest in Norfolk is further dlustrated by his grants to the Priory of Castle Acre, a Cluniac house, whose site and precinct formed the western boundary of his Honour of Mileham. His charter, already printed,31 I will not here recite, but only re mark that Adelina, his wife, is a party thereto ; that he gives land at Kameston (Kempston), and \" apud Sparlacum\" (at Sporle), also three solidates of rent out of his mill of Newton, with other things ; and that three of the witnesses to this deed, viz. Ruald le Strange, Gorhannus, and Henry de Pagrave, were probably ancestors of John le Strange, Herbert Fitz Gurant, and William de Pagrave, who held three of the five knights' -fees, which, in 1165, constituted the Nor folk fief of Fitz-Alan.32 A confirmation of King Henry I.'s to Castle-Acre, which seems to have passed in 1109, does not include Alan Fitz Flaald's dona tions,33 which I therefore take to have been later. He seems to have otherwise benefited this house, and a different confirmation of Henry I., which I have no means of dating, alludes to his further grants.34 A grant by William de Bosevill, to the same Priory, conveys the 311 Monasticon, IV. 17, No. VI. 31 Monasticon,Y. 51, No. IX.

His grants, too, were afterwards confirmed and augmented by persons whom I cannot make out to have been descended from Alan. One of these, Simon de Norfolc, mentions his \"ancestors from the time of Alan Fitz Flaald,\" speaks of his (Simon's) mother, Avelina, and of the day when he (Simon) acquired {conquisivit) the Honour of Mile ham."], [249, "219 ALAN FITZ FLAALD. church of Newton, aud is tested by Alan Fitz Flaald. This grant I believe to have been earlier than 1109.35 \u25a0 I should notice parenthetically that the foreign Abbey of St. Flo rant, near Saumur, on the Loire (diocese of Angers, province of Anjou), had several very ancient cells in England. I here instance Andover (Hampshire), Sele (Sussex), and Sporle (Norfolk), because I can show a connection between Alan Fitz Flaald, or his descendants, and each of these cells. \u2014 Sporle to wit, was near to, if not a member of the honour of Mileham : and its endowments lay chiefly in Alan Fitz Flaald's Norfolk fief, viz. in Great a'nd Little Palgrave, in Dunham Magna, Mileham, Hunstanston, and Holme.36 Early in the reign of Henry I., the privileges of their church or cell of Andover being iu question, the monks of St. Florant de fended the same. An inspeximus of the record, which details the consequent proceedings, calls the said record, by great error, a char ter of King William I. Whatever of royal charter is involved in the narrative is by Henry I., and must have passed between 1103-1107, probably in the former year. The royal memorial favours the im munities of the monks of St. Florant. It passed at Storunell, in the New Forest, where the King was probably hunting, and is at tested amongst others by Alan Fitz Flaald.37 As regards the cell of St. Peter's at Sele, both a son and a grand son of Alan Fitz Flaald were benefactors thereto, as the charter tes tifies; wherein the grandson (called Jordan, son of Jordan, son of Alan Fitz Flaald) is said to have confirmed the mill of Burton to the Abbey of St. Florant, as his father had previously given it.38 The evident connection between the Ancestor of the Fitz-Alans and an Anjc-vin Monastery possibly points to some fact in their early history ; but to me that fact is latent. I now pass to a much more important and more difficult subject, the connection of Alan Fitz Flaald with Shropshire. We have seen 35 Ibidem, so. 23, b. its date as circa 1109. 36 The foundation of Sporle has been attributed to Henry II., probably because he was an Aujovin. I should suppose it to have been earlier than his day, but little is known about it. 38 Dallaway's Sussex,, Vol. IL pt. II. p. 225, No. X. The grandson's grant seems to have been in the way of restitu tion, and to have been made \" during the sickness whereof he died, and in the pre sence of the Archbishop.\" The original deed, with other Sele charters, is, I pre sume, in possession of the President and Fellows of St. M. Magdalene Coll., Oxford. 37 __so_.a.s&o\u00ab,VII.992,No.I. Another attestation of Alan Fitz Flaald's to a charter of Henry I., was at York (Monas ticon, VI. 683, No. V.) . I can only guess"], [250, "220 UPTON MAGNA. that he must have been enfeoffed in Norfolk before the period of that great Shropshire catastrophe, the forfeiture and exile of Earl Robert de Belesme. We have also seen that the latter event occurred in the autumn of 1102, and that, a month or two later, Rainald, the Domesday sheriff of that county, was apparently unaffected in credit or estate by the fall of his suzerain.39 Lastly, we have seen a probability that Hugh son of Warin succeeded for a short interval after the cession of Rainald, and died without issue. Then came the event thus described in the only, but very autho ritative document, which touches the question. \u2014 \" Alanus filius Fla daldi honorem Vicecomitis Warini post filium ejus suscepit.\"40 From these words has arisen the unwarranted statement that Alan fitz Flaald acquired his Shropshire fief by marrying a supposed daughter and eventual heir of Warin. Had it been so, I think the precise and nearly coeval document which I have quoted, would have stated the fact. My conviction is that Alan fitz Flaald received by a new inves titure, and by grant of Henry I., the whole Honour of the Sheriff of Shropshire, whether we call it the Honour of Warin, of Rainald, or of Hugh ; \u2014 that he so received it during the first ten years of Henry's reign, but under no claim whatever of hereditary right or succession. This \"Honour of the Sheriff\" still lay, as it did at Domesday, \u2014 chiefly in Shropshire, but involving lands in Staffordshire, Warwick shire, aud Sussex.41 In three out of these four counties I have now to speak of Alan fitz Flaald's further concern. \u2014 In the autumn of 1109, Henry I. paid a visit to Shropshire. It was during that visit I suppose that the King, Richard (de Belmeis) Bishop of London, Alan fitz Flaald, Hamo Peverel, Roger and Robert Corbet, and Herbert fitz Helgot, attested a judicial decision of the Bishop, which regarded some right of Shrewsbury Abbey.42 To the same Abbey, and probably at the same period, \" Alan fitz Fladald, with ready devotion, conceded all things which had been bestowed by his predecessors43 or by his barons, whether in his time 39 Supra, Vol. II. pp. 193, 194. under King or Earl at Domesday. 42 Salop Chartulary, No. I. 40 Monasticon, III. 519, col. a.\u2014 This document is a narrative of their endow ments, drawn up by the monks of Shrews bury, and confirmed by King Stephen soon after his accession. 43 \" Anteeessoribus \" is the word used, which, if translated \" Ancestors \" might lead to error. The latter implies here ditary precedence, a meaning which the usage of the time did not attach to the word \" antecessores.\" \"\" Viz. all which Bainaldus, Bainaldus Vicecomes, or Bainaldus Bailiole had held"], [251, "221 ALAN FITZ FLAALD. or previously.\" Of this were witnesses Richard Bishop of London, Hamo Peverel, Roger fitz Corbet, and nearly the whole county.44 We learn this from a recitatory charter of King Henry I., which passed in 1121. The statement is repeated in Stephen's confirmation (above noticed), with the additional clause about Alan fitz Flaald having received the Honour of Warin. Confirmations of Henry II. and Henry III. mention and ratify a grant of tithes in Opton (Upton Magna) to Salop Abbey, by Alan Vicecomes. This was doubtless Alan fitz Flaald, but I know of no other instance of his being described by a title, which probably in dicated rather his right as of fee, than any active discharge of the office of sheriff. In fact, we know that during the whole of Alan's life the official deputy of Belmeis in Shropshire was Fulcuius. Dugdale estimated the period of Alan Fitz Flaald's tenure of Wolston, Warwickshire (it was part of the fief of Rainald under Earl Roger at Domesday), to have been as early as the time of the said Earl or one of his sons, that is, as early as the year 1102.43 In this antiquity of dates, Dugdale was mistaken. Dugdale construc tively intimates that Dame Adeliza, who granted in Wolston to Burton Abbey, before the year 1114, was Alan Fitz Flaald's widow, and the mother of that Sibil who, with her husband Roger de Fre ville, confirmed Dame Adeliza's grant in the year 1132. \u2014 Here, I doubt not that Dugdale was right ; but it does not at first appear how Dame Adeliza, as a widow, could grant definitely in her hus band's fief. That difficulty is solved by a further piece of evidence in the Burton register, viz. that the monks of Burton \" redeemed the grant by a payment of six merks to Roger de Frevdle and Sibil his wife in 1132.\"46 I shall say nothing more as to Alan Fitz Flaald's Warwickshire fief, than that it involved the Manor of Stretton super Dunesmore; that that manor had constituted part of Rainald's Domesday fief, and that there Alan Fitz Flaald himself sometime made a specific grant to Burton Abbey. As succeeding to the shrievalty and estates of Rainald, Alan Fitz Flaald will have been a tenant in the Honour of Arundel. I have, tabular statement of their succession, as suggested, not asserted by him. It may help to clear a difficult question if I add that, in 1165, En gelram de Wlfricheston and Hamo filius Eadulfi, held jointly a knight's-fee under Fitz Alan, and that that fee was Wolston. Dugdale's Genea logy takes no notice of these two persons. 44 Salop Chartulary, No. 35. 45 Dugdale's Warwickshire (Thomas's Edition), Vol. I. p. 33. 46 Dugdale's MSS. in Bibl. Ashmol., 13 G. i., so. 529. The same Eoger de Freville and Sibil, his wife, also made a grant in Wolston to Kenilworth Priory. Dugdale has given us, under Wolston, a"], [252, "222 UPTON MAGNA. however, no notice of his personal concern in Sussex. A Feodary of the Honour of Arundel, which I have elsewhere ascribed to the year 1135,47 enters this tenure as \"Stokes II. milites,\" without giving the name of the then tenant.48 The widow however of Alan Fitz Flaald, called in this instance Avelina, seems to have had part of her dower in these Sussex estates ; for William Fitz Alan, her eldest son, granting', between the years 1155 and 1158, the land of \"Piperinges\" to Haughmond Abbey, added to his grant such rights of common-pasture in the neighbour ing vill of Stokes as had been previously enjoyed by \" his mother Avelina.\"49 On the whole, therefore, we conclude that Alan Fitz Flaald was enfeoffed by Henry I. in Norfolk, in 1100 or 1101, in Shropshire, etc., after 1102 and before 1109; that he was living in the latter year, but dead in 1114. His wife and widow, variously called Adelina, Adeliza, or Avelina, perhaps survived him many years.50 Their marriage must have taken place, as we shall presently see, between 1100 and 1105. Who she was, shall now be our inquiry, and I think that that point can be settled without doubt. The various fees in Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, and elsewhere, which formed the Domesday Barony of Ernulf de Hesding, are found in 1 165 to be divided among coparceners. A third of this fief, or there abouts, was then vested in the representatives of Alan Fitz Flaald. Now, that Ernulf de Hesding, who for his brave defence of Shrews bury in 1138, was so mercilessly put to death by Stephen, was, as Ordericus informs us, maternal uncle (avunculus) of William Fitz Alan. Therefore William Fitz Alan's mother and Alan Fitz Flaald's wife was Aveline de Hesding, and she was in her issue a co-heiress.51 These are the undoubted conclusions to be adopted from a mass of difficulties which beset the succession of the Domesday Ernulf de Hesding. With the residue of those difficulties we have nothing here to do. We are content to have demolished the old error, which made the wife of Alan Fitz Flaald a daughter of Warin, sheriff of Shropshire. I proceed now to name the children of Alan Fitz 47 Supra, Vol. II. p. 202, note. 48 Liber Niger, 1. 65. Fitz Alan, which lay in Wiltshire, is ex pressly said to have previously belonged to \" Ernulf de Hesdinges \" (Liber Niger, I. 145).

I here add, or rather deduce, that he must have been born about 1105; not much later, as his younger brother was of age in 1129; not much earlier, otherwise Ordericus could hardly have called him a youth in 1138.53 Of Jordan Fitz Alan I have spoken briefly above. It remains to say of him that in the year 1129 and 1130 he seems to have been farming for King Henry I. some royal manor in Nottinghamshire or Derbyshire;54 also in 1130 he was excused his quota of the Danegeld, then assessed on those counties and on Lincolnshire. In Lincolnshire too the sheriff is allowed to deduct _\u00a34. 16s. from his yearly ferm in respect of \" land of Jordan Fitz Alan ;\" that is, I presume, land then first granted by the King to the said Jordan.55 Of Sibil, married to Roger de Freville, in or before 1132, I have before spoken. WALTEB FITZ ALAN. It remains now to treat of Walter Fitz Alan, the undoubted ancestor of the Royal House of Stewart, and therefore the person around whose name some of our previous arguments and some of our future conclusions must assemble as their centre. I shall, in my notice of Haughmond Abbey, show how Walter Fitz Alan at tested the earliest grant which his brother William is known to have made to the canons of that house. I shall further exhibit Walter Fitz Alan as in the court of the Empress at Oxford, in the summer of 1141; where also were David, King of Scots, and William Fitz Alan. Again, a charter of the Empress, made somewhat later to Haugh mond, has the attestation of Walter Fitz Alan. So also has a grant of William Fitz Alan to Shrewsbury Abbey, which I cannot date with any certainty, but think it must have passed between William Fitz Alan, son of_the person here spoken of. He came of age in 1175; and in 1188 (when he was thirty-four yeara of age) Giraldus, his guest, calls him \" a noble and liberal young man.\" 52 Simon, a brother of Walter Fitz Alan, attests a charter of the latter about 1163. I know nothing further of him with any certainty. He is the reputed ancestor of Boyd, Earl of Errol. 53 Hewouldthenbethirty-t_u-ee,accord ing to my estimate, and I believe it was the custom of that age to use the term \"juvenis\" much later than is consistent with our ideas.

The place alluded to was undoubtedly in Shropshire, and was perhaps Cound.59 This is all that I can say of Walter Fitz Alan, as connected with England. Notwithstanding his re-appearance in this country on his elder brother's restoration (1155), it is quite clear that during the reverses which began to attend the cause of the Empress in 1141, Walter Fitz Alan had taken refuge in the court of her uncle, \u2014 David, King of Scots. He attested a grant of that Monarch to Melrose Abbey, which seems to have passed in June, 1142, at Er cheldon.60 He also attests King David's Charter to May Priory, which is dated at Kyngor, and must have passed between August 1147 and May 1153.61 Also he attested a Charter of Prince Henry of Scotland to Holm Cultram,62 which must have passed after the foundation of that house in January 1150, and before the death of the Prince, in May or June 1152. Malcolm IV. ascended the throne of Scotland on May 24, 1153. On June 24, 1157, being at Roxburgh, he expedited a Charter to Walter Fitz Alan, his Seneschal (Dapifero) . It confirms to the said Walter and his heirs the donation which King David, the grantor's grandfather, gave him, viz. Renfrew and Passeleth. It also gives to him and his heirs the Royal Seneschalcy, as King David gave the same.63 The Scottish Abbey of Paisley, near Renfrew, is said to have been founded in 1163. Its founder was Walter Fitz Alan, and it was colonized with monks from the great Cluniac house of Wen lock, in Shropshire. The latter event is placed, by the Melrose 56 Salop Chartulary, No. 84. natyne Club, p. 4). w Harleian MS. 2188, so. 123. G1 Monasticon, IV. 62, i.

He instances Robert de Munde gumbi, Robert and Geoffrey de Costentin, Richard Wall and Roger de Nesse.65 Walter Fitz Alan, Seneschal of the King of Scotland, was a bene factor also to Melrose Abbey. He granted to that house the lands of Machline in Kyle, about the year 1170, says my authority. His charter seems to be yet in existence. Its seal presents on one side the figure of an \" armed Knight on horseback, at full speed ; a lance, with pennon, couched in his right hand, and a shield on his left arm.\" The legend is \u2014 Sigillum Walteri filii Alani Dapiferi Reg. The counter-seal presents \" a Warrior with a spear in his right hand, leaning against a pillar, and with his left hand holding a horse.\"66 Here then we have another authentic notice of Walter Fitz Alan as Steward, or Seneschal of the King of Scots. At his death, in 1177, the Melrose Chronicle accords him the same title, as well as commemorates the ties which had bound him to that house. \u2014 \" Obiit Walterus filius Alani, dapifer Regis Scoti\u0153, familiaris noster, cujus beata anima vivat in gloria.\" Walter Fitz Alan was succeeded by his son Alan, called Alan Fitz Walter. He also granted (or confirmed) Machline in Kyle to Melrose Abbey, and apparently early in his life.

The legend is \u2014 Sigill' Walteri filii Alani.69 This is the same Walter Fitz Alan who, as Seneschal, attests the deed whereby Alexander II. of Scotland fixed the dower of the English Princess, Johanna.

Mr. Laing also quotes a deed of Alexander Stuart, son of this Walter, which he dates circa 1226, and deeds of James Stuart, son of Alexander, which he dates circa 1270 and 1296.

He left two sons, James and John, the former of whom occurs as Seneschal of Scot land on February 5, 1283, and throughout the reign of Edward I. of England, to whom he did formal homage as Seneschal of Scot land, on October 23, 1306. But without entering upon the various political changes of that period, it is necessary that I should descend one step further in my notices of the Stewardship of Scotland. It is to mark the insidious craft with which Edward III. endeavoured to undermine that na tional institution. From a Writ of the year 1339, we learn that the King, affecting to consider Richard Fitz Alan (then Earl of Arundel in England) as Hereditary Steward of Scotland, actually purchased the Earl's title to that office for a sum of 1000 merks.73 Here then is a token that one fact was well understood in that day, viz. that the English Fitz Alans and the Stuarts of Scotland were descended from a common ancestor, i.e. from Alan Fitz Flaald, and that the Fitz Alans were the elder representatives of the line. I now leave this matter to the more intelligible form of a tabular pedigree, and proceed to state my own belief as to that part of it which at present has not been fortified by proof. \u2014 ALAN FITZ FLAALD. (resumed). My belief then is, that the son of Fleance was named Alan, not Walter, and that he whom the English called Alan Fitz Flaald, was the person in question.74 The change from Fleanchus to Flaaldus is not very great, when we compare it with other instanceVwhere a foreign name had to be accommodated to the English ear. We must remember, too, how a Norfolk^ Jury, wishing evidently to designate the father of Alan Fitz Flaald, called him Flancus, though this probable approach to etymological correctijess was adulterated with a great historical inaccuracy. As to the Prior of Ely's genealogy of the Stuarts, so fully quoted above I can take it for nothing more than a conjectural embodi ment of certain traditions preserved in the family. Possibly, what 73 Dugdale's Baronage, p. 316-b. 74 The alternative is, that there was a Walter, son of Fleance, and father of Alan Fitz Flaald. That supposition is not inconsistent with chronological possi bility, and it has the support of the Scot tish legends. But it makes Alan Fitz*- Flaald to be in reality Alan Fitz Walter.

Between Fleance and Alexander he inserts four genera tions, the number of the annexed pedigree . but his four successive names are Walter, Alan, Alexander, and Walter, whereas I have given them as Alan, Walter, Alan, and Walter. About the second and third he is demonstrably wrong, probably, therefore, about the first and more remote. But to continue. \u2014 The equivocal circumstances which seem to have attended the birth and education of the Son of Fleance may well have affected him and his immediate successors in such a way as that they were disinclined to make any parade of their origin, even if they did not studiously conceal it. Alan Fitz Flaald's sup posed changes of country, from Wales to Scotland, and from Scot land to England, gave unusual facilities for such concealment. I take it to have been Henry I.'s marriage with a Scottish prin cess which first brought Alan Fitz Flaald to the English court. He came, I should suppose, in the suite of Queen Matilda, and if he had been formerly distinguished as a servant of King Malcolm, and more recently as a Crusader, nothing is more probable than that he was retained by Henry I. on account of capabilities which, at that period of his reign, were greatly needed by the King. The enormous Fief with which the King so promptly advanced a stranger, does not help us to determine who that stranger was ; for, as I have explained, no specific claim to the shrievalty of Shropshire could have accrued to Alan Fitz Flaald, either by inheritance or by marriage. I say no specific claim to the shrievalty, because I am not sure that Alan Fitz Flaald had not a large claim on the King's consideration, and one of an hereditary nature too, though not amounting to a legal right, nor to any claim on the particular lands which he obtained. And here I introduce one hypothesis more, which possibly may be relevant to the whole subject. Algar, Earl of Mercia, who died in 1059, left two sons, the Earls Morcar and Edwin. They both suf fered forfeiture after the Conquest ; both, perhaps, died by violent deaths, nor is either of them said to have left any surviving issue. But Earl Algar is said also to have left two daughters. About one of these alleged daughters, Lucia, there is much mystery, but the same legends which name her relationship to Earl Algar, make her also to have been ancestress of the Anglo-Norman Earls of Chester"], [261, "231 ALAN FITZ FLAALD. and of Lincoln. The other daughter of Earl Algar is called Alditha, and said to have been wife, first of Griffyth ap Lewellyn, Prince of North Wales, and secondly of Harold, son of Earl Godwin. With this supposed remarriage to Harold I have nothing here to do ; but if Alditha was a daughter of Earl Algar, and the wife of Griffyth, she may also have been mother of Griffyth's daughter, \u2014 of that Guenta, I mean, whom legends would teach us to have been the wife of Fleance, or at least mother by Fleance of Alan Fitz Flaald. Again, if Alan Fitz Flaald was the legitimate son of Fleance and Guenta, and if the other circumstances alleged above be true or probable, it is also true or probable that Alan Fitz Flaald was the great-grandson of Earl Algar, and (setting aside attainders) one of the legitimate representatives of the Saxon Earls of Mercia. Then, again, if Henry I. were prevented by law, custom, Norman preju dices, or Norman interests, from recognizing in Alan Fitz Flaald an hereditary right to particular estates already in the hands of others, it is still possible that the husband of a Scoto- Saxon princess may have seen something of justice in placing a descendant of Earl Algar in a prominent position, especially when this supposed scion of an ill-fated house was a Scot, able and brave, a courtier Ukely to return a voluntary favour with gratitude, not a demandant likely to treat involuntary gifts as concessions. Then, too, we may suppose a policy in the King's measure. \u2014 By giving to Alan Fitz Flaald the specific fief of the Sheriff of Shropshire, he encouraged no notion of hereditary right, such as might have led to further and extravagant expectations, but he placed in the very van of border warfare a chieftain, who, if our assumptions are correct, could trace his descent from the native Princes of North Wales. We certainly conclude, then, that the personal favour and pe culiar policy of Henry I. were two causes of Alan Fitz Flaald's advancement. We suggest that a compassion for misfortune and a sense of justice may have had their influence on the King's conduct. Whatever the motives and whatever the facts, they are worth an investigation, even fuller than that which I have here given them ; for they concern the foundation of a most illustrious house, a house which still numbers among its representatives the Queen of England and the highest of her subjects,75 while there is hardly an 75 The Queen represents one branch of j the Stuarts.

WILLIAM FITZ ALAN. If, as I suppose, William fitz Alan was born about 1105, and his father was deceased in 1114, it is evident that he must have had a long minority. It will hereafter be shown probable that his Foun dation of Haughmond Abbey was the work of his youth or early manhood, and so took place at a time when we do not hear of him in public life. Haughmond Abbey, though located within that very Manor of Upton, which is now our subject, requires a separate notice, and I shall say little of it in the present Chapter. I shall here confine myself as much as possible to the political career of William fitz Alan. This illustrious person probably attained his majority at a time when Pagan fitz John, the second Viceroy of Henry I., was all powerful in the West. If King Stephen's Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey passed in 1136, it contains the earliest mention of William fitz Alan, otherwise than in connection with Haughmond. It re cites how William son and heir of Alan fitz Flaald, in presence of the whole County and with his own seal, had confirmed all things given by his Father to Shrewsbury Abbey. It also quotes a grant made by Hamo Peverell since Stephen's accession (December 26, 1135), of which William fitz Alan stands the first witness.76 About the same period we have seen William Fitz Alan attesting Bishop Clinton's Foundation Charter of Buildwas Abbey, and there is great probability that Robert the Consul, Earl of Gloucester, was a wit ness on the same occasion.77 Further, I think it likely that on the fall of Pagan fitz John in 1136, William fitz Alan's hereditary Shrievalty was recognized by Stephen ; I mean his capability of discharging the office, as well as holding the estates, of the Sheriff in-fee. Certain it is that Fitz Alan in the Spring of 1138 was, with Stephen's concurrence, Castellan of Shrewsbury, an office which in later times usually devolved on the acting Sheriff. In May 1138, Robert the Consul formally renounced all allegiance to Stephen; and, in the course of the summer, from ten to twelve of the strongest Castles in the Kingdom were armed against the Usurper. Stephen was never slow in military action. He reduced or disabled two Castles at once, but failed in his attacks on Bristol '6 Monasticon, III. 519. | Tl Supra, Yol. VI. p. 322."], [263, "233 WILLIAM FITZ ALAN. and Dudley. From the latter place he marched upon Shrewsbury ; but I will translate the whole affair from the language of cotemporary Writers. \u2014 Henry of Huntingdon says as follows : \u2014 \" William fitz Alan held the Castle of Salopesbiri against the King. This Castle the King took by assault, and hanged certain of his prisoners ; at news whereof Walkeline (Maminoht) who was holding Dover Castle surrendered it to the Queen (Stephen's Queen), who was besieging it.\" Ordericus is much more full. \u2014 \"William fitz Alan, Castellan (Municeps) and Vicecomes of Scrobesbury, who had in marriage a niece of Rodbert Earl of Gloucester, inclining to favour the said Earl's cause, rebelled against the King, and held the aforesaid town in spite of him nearly a month. At length, in the month of August, worsted by the royal prowess, he fled, and the King by a determined assault reduced the Castle. Arnulf de Hesdinge, a brave and rash knight, and uncle of the said youth (Fitz Alan) , had often rejected with pride the King's offers of peace, and had moreover presumed to utter injurious language against the King, and had constrained some to persist in rebellion who were willing to surrender them selves. So at length when the Castle was reduced, Arnulf, with many others, being taken prisoner was brought before the insulted Prince. But the King, seeing that by his forbearance he only gained the contempt of the contumacious, and that so, many of the Nobles who were summoned to his Court scorned to attend, com manded in his anger that Arnulf and about ninety-three others who had resisted should be hanged or put to other modes of instant death. Arnulf, penitent too late, and several of the rest, entreated the King for mercy, and promised vast sums for their redemption. But the King preferring revenge on wickedness to any weight of gold, they were forthwith executed.\" Ordericus we see was a Stephanite, and it is to be regretted that we have not the counter-testimony of William of Malmesbury on this transaction. The Continuator of Florence of Worcester, a more violent Stephanite than Ordericus, tells the story in a way far from creditable to Fitz Alan. \u2014 \" Stephen (having ravaged the neighbourhood of Dudley) set out with a great force to besiege Shrewsbury Castle, which William fitz Alan held against him. But the said William, having previous tidings of the King's approach, clandestinely got away with his wife and children and some others, leaving in the Castle certain persons sworn not to surrender it. After a siege of many days, an engine of the following nature was vn. 30"], [264, "234 UPTON MAGNA. constructed to storm it, as men who knew the particulars describe it. A great heap of wood was got together, close under the Castle ; then the Castle-ditch was filled up ; the wood was set on fire ; the smoke rose up, and reached and suffocated all the garrison (omnes infumigat et exfumigat). The gate was forced open by the King's attack. Men, tumbling down from, or creeping away from the walls, began a pitiable flight. Pursuit and slaughter was the Royal command ; but five fugitives of the nobler class were hanged.\" The persons thus ignominiously put to death by Stephen were not only of gentle blood, but were fighting in the cause of con science and honour, the cause of legitimacy and of a disinherited woman. The infamy of a transaction, which, at any ordinary pe riod in the age of chivalry, would have overturned a rightful throne, does not appear to have shaken that of Stephen. The cotemporary success of his Lieutenants against the Scots perhaps obliterated his personal enormities at Shrewsbury. Next year, flushed with suc cess, he ran into courses far more hazardous, as the event proved, than that of hanging open foes. He began to persecute suspected Bishops. Execrated if not banned by the Church, it was on Febru ary 2nd, 1141, that he marshalled his troops on the fatal field of Lincoln. From that field he was led a prisoner to the dungeons of Bristol Castle. Now came the day of prosperity to the Em press, and she misused her opportunity more speedily and more arrogantly than even Stephen had done. Slighting and thwarting her best supporters, the seventh month of her ascendency had hardly set in, when she is found before Winchester, besieging Henry of Blois, Bishop of that See and brother of Stephen. Here again William fitz Alan recurs to our notice. A cotemporary writer, though a partisan of Stephen, pays him a noble compliment. He names him with four other Barons who fought on the side of the Empress, and whom he declares to have been \"in no way inferior to the great Earls who supported her cause, \u2014 neither in fidelity, merit, valour, nor high repute.\"78 The story of the Empress's retreat from Winchester is well known. Her uncle, the King of Scots, and her brother, the Earl of Glou cester, fell into the hands of the enemy. The Earl was soon after wards ransomed, but Stephen's enlargement was the condition and the price of the Earl's. Through the twelve years of war and terror which now ensued it is difficult to trace the career even of one as great as William fitz Alan. I do not as heretofore find 78 Gesta Regis Stephani (1846), p. 81."], [265, "235 WILLIAM FITZ ALAN. him attesting Deeds in the Court of the Empress, neither in England nor after her retirement to France. Nor yet, like his younger brother, does he appear in the Scottish Court of King David. There is perhaps an indication that at times he asserted a right of interference in his Shropshire estates, but of his presence in the County we have not a hint. One of the most remarkable characters of this period was Ranulf, suruamed de Gernons or de Briquessart, Earl of Chester. With influence and resources too great for a subject, endowed as to his person with strength, activity, and courage of the highest order, fertile in expedients, and never daunted by misfortune, his vacilla tion was so great that his friendship was deemed as ominous as his enmity often proved to be formidable. His usual demonstra tions, perhaps his only sincere ones, were in favour of the Empress. Whenever allied with Stephen he was suspected by that Monarch, whom in truth he never seems to have treated as more than an equal. Under this Earl, William fitz Alan held the two Cheshire Manors now known as Dunham on ihe Hill and Wimbolds Trafford. It is more probable that Fitz Alan had them by feoffment of Earl Ranulph than that he inherited them from Alan fitz Flaald. I find indications, too few to constitute a continuous proof, that during the twelve years above mentioned William fitz Alan found an asylum in the Palatine Court of Chester. His wife, being a niece of the Earl of Gloucester, was necessarily near of kin to the Countess of Chester, who was the said Earl's daughter. It was doubtless in some of these relations, that is, as the Suzerain, the Protector, or the friend and connection, of William fitz Alan, that Ranulph, Earl of Chester, befriended the infant Monastery of Haughmond at a time (1141-1153) when it must have been bereft of the immediate care of its Founder. By his Charter dated at Chester the Earl grants to the Monastery \" one boat (batum) in his water of Dee, and quittance of all toll on eels (caught there) to the extent of 6000 eels per annum.\" This Charter was attested by William fitz Alan himself, by Richard Pincerna, Richard Phiton, Ralph Man sell, and William Chaplain.79 King Henry II.'s Confirmation to Shrewsbury Abbey passed in July 1155. It enumerates the three following grants, viz. the tithes of Dunham, and 4 bovates in Trohford, as having been given by Wilbam fitz Alan, and the Church of Trohford as having been given by Richard, a Chaplain of Fitz Alan's. These Grants had 79 Haughmond Chartulary, Tit. Chester."], [266, "236 UPTON MAGNA. certainly been made during the usurpation, for Ranulf Earl of Chester, who died in December 1153, had previously confirmed a part of them. The Earl's Charter confirms the Chapel of Troh ford and 4 bovates of land, both as granted by William fitz Alan ; and William fitz Alan attests the confirmation, with Norman de Verdon, The Abbot of Chester, and Robert de Stafford.80 It is probable that other Charters of Earl Ranulf de Gernons to Salop Abbey are to be associated with this same period and with his relations to Fitz Alan. The latter not only founded Haughmond Abbey and facilitated the foundation of Wombridge Priory, but was a benefactor to other religious Houses in Shropshire. He seems to have had a special regard for Shrewsbury. By one Charter he gives the Monks that bank of the river Severn which was part of his land (at Cound probably), in aid of a Mill which they had made at Eiton (Eyton on Severn) . Witnesses, \u2014 Fulk fitz Warin ; Richard, Chaplain ; Heming, Priest ; John, Seneschal (Dapifero) .81 He also gave half his fee in the Wich of Worcestershire (Droitwich I presume), both in salt and in land. Witnesses, \u2014 Walter my brother, Richard my Chaplain, John le Strange and Wido his bro ther.82 Both these Charters are included in Henry II.'s confirma tion of 1155. They probably passed during the usurpation, or at least immediately after the restoration. The same may be said of a third Charter, already noticed under Cound,83 but which, perhaps from its temporary nature, was not included in any Royal Con firmation. Henry Duke of Normandy landed in England to claim the Crown in January 1153. It is probable that Fitz Alan at once joined his standard and shared in the campaign of the following summer. At least I shall be able to show, under Haughmond Abbey, that he was with the Duke at Leicester in June. A treaty of pacification between Stephen and the Duke was en tered upon in November following, and the Duke left England on April 4th, 1154. It does not appear that in the treaty with Ste phen the Duke stipulated for the restoration of his disinherited supporters. Fitz Alan to all appearance did not regain his Shrop shire estates till Henry, having succeeded to the throne in De cember 1154, had reduced Hugh de Mortimer in July 1155. The King then reinvested Fitz Alan not only in his estates, but in the Shrievalty of Shropshire ; and to show how complete the change 80 Salop Chartulary, No. 377. 81 Ibidem, No. 310. 82 Ibidem, No. 84. 83 Supra, Vol. VI. p. 70."], [267, "237 WILLIAM FITZ ALAN. was, from absolute forfeiture to Ml enjoyment, Fitz Alan on July 25, at Bridgnorth, received the homage of his Tenants, as though he were an heir just attaining his majority, and had never received such homage before. The events of that year and Fitz Alan's participation therein, I have already made part of the history of Bridgnorth.84 At this time Constantia, niece of the Earl of Gloucester and wife of William fitz Alan, was deceased, and it is probable that any sons she may have borne him were deceased also and without issue. The richest heiress of Shropshire, Isabel de Say, Baroness of Clun, became his second wife, and doubtless this was one of the first marriages which fell to the disposal of Henry II. William fitz Alan held the Shrievalty and enjoyed his restored estates for less than five years. Beyond the routine duties of his office and his grants to religious foundations we hear nothing of him during this period. He died about Easter 1160, and was buried in Shrewsbury Abbey, if we may judge from a Deed whereby he gives 100 Solidates of land in Iseham, together with his body, to that House.85 The testing- clause of this Deed probably indicates the personages who were assembled around the death-bed of the illustrious chief. There was Roger the Archdeacon of Salop, who held that office for nearly 60 years, more than half of which had al ready expired. There were the Abbots of Haughmond, Lilleshall, and Buildwas, and the Prior of Wenlock. There were John and Guy le Strange, Herbert de Castello, William fitz Odo, Wilham de Baucis, William Trussel, Roger fitz Adam, Ivo Pantulf, Reiner de Clun, Richard fitz Beringer, Master Roger, Robert fitz Alured, and Robert Pincerna ;86 \u2014 names which all or nearly all belong to the known history of the period. On the day of the anniversary of William fitz Alan, his Lord, and for the soul of the said William fitz Alan, John le Strange gave one Tenant, and all the land held by the said Tenant in Yseham, to Shrewsbury Abbey. Witnesses, \u2014 Humbald Prior of Wenloc, Wido his (the Grantor's) brother, Hamo his (the Grantor's) nephew, Roger Grent, and Roger fitz Adam.87 At Fitz Alan's death his son and heir by Isabel de Say cannot have been more than five years of age, and though he had livery 84 Supra, Vol. I. pp. 250-252. 85 Iselham was in Cambridgeshire, but Some facts in the later history of the Ma nor have already been given (Vol. II. pp. 294, 300). a member of Fitz Alan's Norfolk Honour of Mileham and inherited from his father. 86 \u2022 \u00ab7 Salop Chartulary, Nos. 285, 287."], [268, "238 UPTON MAGNA. in 1175, it was probably by special favour, abridging the period of his minority. Meantime I should give a full account of the mode in which his estates were managed, and how the Shrievalty of Shropshire was bestowed. \u2014 Guy le Strange was apparently appointed to the latter Office im mediately on the death of William fitz Alan I. He was also ap pointed Custos of the deceased Baron's Estates. His tenure of both trusts has, as far as he was personally concerned, been already de scribed.88 Some entries on his accounts relate more particularly to the affairs of the Fitz Alans, and those I shall quote here. In 1160 he, as Sheriff, charges \u00a34. 10*. for his outlay on certain Falcons which having been William fitz Alan's were now the King's. In the same year his receipts as Custos of the Fitz Alan estates, during six months were .\u20ac59. Out of this sum he had paid \u00a37. 15s. in livery of the Servientes of three Castles of the deceased Baron, viz. Clun, Blancminster (i.e. Oswestry), and Ruthin. He had further paid \u00a34. 10s. in restocking some Manors, and \u00a318. in matters relating to Fitz Alan's Widow (in negotiis Domin\u00e6). In 1161 the year's income from the estates was \u00a3155. 10s. Sd. The Servientes of the three Castles had cost \u00a354. 15s. ; and 4 merks had been paid to the Monks of Bermondsey, i. e. two years', arrears of an annuity of 2 merks, doubtless bequeathed by Fitz Alan to that Monastery. The accounts of 1162, 1163, and 1164 are sub stantively the same ; but in the last year an additional receipt of \u00a35. is acknowledged as the ferm of the escheated land of Plumsted. This was one of Fitz Alan's Norfolk Manors, but who had held it, or how it had escheated to the Seigneural Lord, I know not. The account of 1165 presents some new features. A deduction of \u00a347. 8s. 4<d. is claimed in respect of lands now held by Geof frey de Vere. Two hundred Servientes for Blancminster had cost \u00a35. 3s. 9d. The waste of Blancminster had been \u00a34. 15s. \u2014 The meaning of all which is, that Geoffrey de Vere had now mar ried Isabel de Say, had carried off with her, as dower, nearly a third of the income of the Fitz Alan estates, and therewith had become responsible for the custody of Clun and Ruthin Castles. The in come from Clun Barony had of course never entered into these ac counts ; for that, being Isabel's own, had been no Escheat, though the King had previously thought proper to provide for the safe cus tody of Clun Castle. The next year (1166) presents Geoffrey de Vere as Sheriff of \u00e6 Supra, Vol. III. pp. 126, 127."], [269, "239 WILLIAM FITZ ALAN. Shropshire. On the other hand, Guy le Strange, still Custos of the Fitz Alan estates, accounts for two years' ferm thereof at Michael mas 1 167. The receipts had increased to \u00a3165. 10s. 7d. per annum, on which Geoffrey de Vere and the Monks of Bermondsey had their usual lien of \u00a347. 8s. 4-d. and \u00a31. 6s. 8d. respectively. The Monks of Shrewsbury are now first accredited with their annuity of \u00a35. in Iselham. The expenses at Oswestry had been enormous, in con sequence of war with Wales ; but that matter belongs to a future Chapter in our History. Lastly, on adding together the two sides of Le Strange's account I find that he debits himself at the Exche quer with \u00a310. more than the actual balance which the figures show against him. He states in a Postscript that he claims \u00a310. which the Earl of Chester and Hugh de Beauchamp detain from him. This mode of balancing an account, though perhaps intelligible, was not usual even in that rude age. The interference of the Earl and Beauchamp I cannot explain. There is no alteration in the substance of this annual account, which need be noticed here, till the year 1170, when Geoffrey de Vere died ; but credit is taken for his full annuity out of the Fitz Alan estates up to Michaelmas. The word habuit is however used instead of the word habet in respect of the lands which furnished the said annuity and which he had ceased to hold. In this year also, it appears that a daughter of the deceased William fitz Alan had mar ried, and that the King had allotted as her portion the land of Bad minton, worth \u00a310. per annum. The said marriage had taken place about March 1170 ; for Guy le Strange only allows half the issues of Badminton as having yet accrued to the Lady; but he quotes a separate Writ of the King authorizing him to allow \u00a37. for her outfit.89 It is far from certain that this daughter of Fitz Alan's was not the daughter of his first wife Christiana. I rather incline to think that she was. The Pipe-Roll does not tell us whom she married, but I can have no hesitation in anticipating a future discussion by saying that her husband was Hugh, son and heir of Ivo Pantulf, Baron of Wem. Badminton, I should add, was in Gloucestershire, and under the name Madmintune stands in Domesday as a Manor of Ernulf de Hesding. In 1171 Guy le Strange accounts again as Sheriff of Shropshire, 89 Ft in quietantid terre de Badmin ton quam Rex dedit cum filid Willielmi filii Alani, 100 sol. de ditnid. anno, per breve Regis. Ft pro pannis filie Willielmi filii Alani 7 lib. per breve Regis."], [270, "240 UPTON MAGNA. and continues to account as usual for the Revenues of the Honour of Fitz Alan. He charges Isabel de Sai's dower of \u00a347. 8s. 4c.. as so much in lands, quas Isabel de Sai tenet de eodem honore. He also claims a quittance of \u00a310. in respect of the land of Badminton, bestowed as aforesaid by the King. The annual account continues unaltered in these respects till 1175, when only three-quarters of the current year's revenue had come to the hands of Guy le Strange, and he had consequently dis bursed only three parts of each annual item of outlay. The fact is then, that about Midsummer 1175, William fitz Alan (II.) was al lowed livery of his inheritance ; and so Guy le Strange's trust had ceased. He continued to hold the Shrievalty, however, till the close of 1179, when probably he died. In this office he was succeeded by Hugh Pantulf, who held it for ten years, and who, I think, was appointed with reference to his connection with young Fitz Alan, and because the latter was not as yet qualified for so important a post. Before I enter on the career of the second William*fitz Alan I must recur to the Feodary of 1166, known as the Liber Niger, and which contains important evidence as to the state of his Barony, and many other contingent subjects. In the first place, though the return in question is entitled Carta Willielmi filii Alani, it is not made by the Baron himself, speaking in the first person, but contains internal evidence of having been drawn up by Inquisition. The testimony of the ancient Feoffees of Norfolk is alleged in support of one averment : the testimony of old-men is quoted as to the amount of service due on the Shrop shire fees, and a doubt as to the service due on the Wiltshire fees is thus expressed, \u2014 Sed non sumus certi quod servitium debeat Regi de hoc tenemento, quod suit Ernulfi de Hesdinges.90 The Norfolk fees were five in number, all apparently of old feoff ment, but the military service due thereon was in proportion to one fee only, and it was returnable at Carlefli, against the Danes.90 The Fief of William fitz Alan in Salopescire and in the appur tenances (by which we must understand some scattered fees in Staf fordshire and Warwickshire) consisted of 14 knights' -fees, and 34| Muntators'-fees of old feoffment, and 8 knights' -fees of new feoff ment.90 Reckoning the Muntator's-fee as equal to half a knight's fee, we have here a Fief equivalent to 39\u00a3 knights'-fees. But the per sonal services due on this tenure were Castle-guard at Blancminster 90 Liber Niger, I. pp. 142-145."], [271, "241 WILLIAM FITZ ALAN II. (Oswestry) only ; the aid of ten knights in any array or expedition (in exercitu et ckevalehid) within the County of Salop ; and the aid of five knights without the said County. In Wiltshire 8\u00a3 knights' fees were held under Fitz Alan, but the personal service due thereon to the Crown was unknown to the Jury. These fees seem to have been of old feoffment, and had once belonged to Ernulf de Hes dinges. It appears from a Gloucestershire entry in the Liber Niger, that seven fees (four at least of which are identical with fees named in Fitz Alan's Wiltshire list) were held in 1166 by Geoffrey de Vere. It seems, then, that the dower of Isabel de Sai, out of her first husband's Barony, was apportioned in Wiltshire and Glou cestershire, and consisted of estates inherited by Fitz Alan from Hesding. Some further remarks on this subject I consign to a note.91 As to the Barony of Clun, that, being Isabel de Sai's own, of course appears in the Liber Niger, as held in capite by her second husband, Geoffrey de Vere.93 WILLIAM FITZ ALAN II. This Baron seems, as I have said, to have had livery of his Shrop shire Barony about Midsummer 1175. Dugdale represents him as accounting in 1173 for livery of certain Fees in Oxfordshire, but the original Pipe-Roll does not apparently furnish such a statement. Before the period of his actual succession, William, son of William fitz Alan, appears in the testing-clauses of several Deeds, which affected his Fief or his Vassals. About the time of his succession he married a daughter of Hugh de Lacy of Ludlow and Ewyas, and 91 Under Gloucestershire and Wiltshire the Liber Niger makes confused and con tradictory statements about a large Fief, di vided apparently between three principal and one or two subsidiary Coparceners. A study of the names of persons holding fees in this Barony shows me that it was the Domesday Barony of Ernulf de Hes ding (I.) which had thus been divided. Patrick Earl of Salisbury (the chief Co parcener) held his share in right of his mother, who is known to have been a Chaworth. Pagan de Munduble, else where called \"de Chaworth\" (the second Coparcener), held Ms share as Grandson of Patrick de Chaworth, living in 1135. Fitz Alan (the third Coparcener), or his stepfather, Geoffrey de Vere, seem, accord ing to one passage, to have held in succes sion to some Ernulf de Hesding ; but an other passage (corrupt in the original MS., and ungrammatical) suggests a question whether Patrick de Chaworth had not been seized of this third portion also, in 1135. (Vide Liber Niger, pp. 108, 170, 171.) The dispersion of the Domesday Barony of Ernulf de Hesding is no matter for Shropshire History, further than to repeat that a nominal third thereof came to Eitz Alan through Avelina de Hesding, wife of Alan Fitz Flaald. The whole ques tion, however, is worth the attention of any Student of Baronial Genealogy. 92 Liber Niger, I. p. 145. 3] VII."], [272, "242 UPTON MAGNA. thus increased his Shropshire Seigneuries to the extent of three Manors, viz. Higford, Middleton Higford, and Upper Ledwich. Lacy's daughter was probably a mere Infant at the time of this contract, for I cannot suppose that the eldest of her children was born before 1190. I shall mention the name of the second William fitz Alan much more frequently in connection with local or monastic Charters, than with political actions. In 1188, Archbishop Baldwin and Giraldus Cambrensis, preaching the Crusade, left Chester immediately after Easter (April 17). They slept the first night at Oswaldstre, where they were \" entertained, after the English manner, by William fitz Alan, a noble and liberal young man.\"93 I have elsewhere remarked on this expression, as compared with the fact that Fitz Alan was upwards of 30 years of age at the time. In the Summer of 1189, William fitz Alan accompanied Ralph de Ardern, Hugh Pantulf, Maurice de Berkeley, William fitz Stephen, and Thomas Noel, or some of them, as a Justice-in-eyre. He thus visited Staffordshire, Worcestershire, Herefordshire, and Gloucestershire, besides acting in his native County, Shropshire. On January 24, 1190, I find him in the Court of King Richard at Westminster ; and it was pro bably about this time that he fined 60 merks, \" that he might have the County of Salop,\" that is, the Shrievalty. At Michaelmas fol lowing he pays one-third of this fine, and accounts, through Regi nald de Hesdin his Deputy, for the whole fiscal year then ended. He continued to hold this office till Easter 1201, when his last ac count closes, and Geoffrey fitz Piers assumed the Shrievalty. The change was probably one of King John's early stretches of pre rogative. Up to that time there is at least an appearance that the Shrievalty was held to be hereditary. Since that time there is not a semblance of its having been so granted or so claimed. Meantime, that is, on November 22, 1192, we have seen William fitz Alan in company with Bishop Hugh de Novant at Build was. On November 9, 1198, he was with King Richard at Roche An dely.94 In June 1199 he fines 60 merks that he may remain in England, and not cross the seas with King John.95 The Pipe-Roll of the year says that he paid the whole sum at once, in the King's chamber, and was quit. In May 1201, he fined 20 merks that Hugh Pantulf (his Predecessor as Sheriff) should be judicially or dered to render to the King, such stock and stores of the Castles 83 Hoare's Giraldus, II. 172. 94 Supra, Vol. III. p. 237, note. I 95 Oblata, p. 2."], [273, "243 WILLIAM FITZ ALAN II. of Shropshire as were in his possession, and had been received by him with those Castles. So the King ordered that Geoffrey fitz Piers (the new Sheriff) should not distrain William fitz Alan to render up the said stock and stores, except so much thereof as he (Fitz Alan) had received when the said Castles came into his keeping.96 Giraldus, the Welsh Historian, tells an anecdote about William fitz Alan, which would suggest, at first sight, that he was either of a cautious and timid disposition, or else that his political conse quence was far less than his possessions in Shropshire would have led us to expect. \u2014 Early in September 1202, the affairs of Giraldus called him across the Border. He slept a night at Haghmon Abbey, and the next night he was entertained on the estate of William fitz Alan, with whom he records himself to have been previously on terms of intimacy and affection. Fitz Alan had recently been in conference with Archbishop Hubert at Worcester, and had heard that powerful Minister inveigh warmly against Giraldus and his schemes. Fitz Alan now sent his Chamberlain to Giraldus, warning him of his danger in the neighbourhood, and stating his own in sufficiency to control Archbishop Hubert's partisans in Shropshire. He regretted his inability to show his own attachment to Giraldus by a hospitable reception.97 Giraldus at once proceeded to Oxford, well content, as it would seem, to view the Archbishop's enmity and Fitz Alan's scruples as so many tributes to his own importance. Thus do we often see that an Egotist is blind to ordinary slights. We know something of Giraldus, Archdeacon of Brecon, from his own writings. They show him to have been not merely a fussy intrigant, but an intolerable coxcomb. It is just possible that the vanity, which makes his lucubrations painful, rendered his social presence disgusting, and that it was Fitz Alan's refinement, rather than any policy, which led him to shun the office of Host on the above occasion. In March 1204, William fitz Alan is acquitted of a tallage of \u00a310. which had been assessed on the men of his Oxfordshire Manor of Norton.98 In the same month he is named by Patent as one of those who were to give safe-conduct to Lewellyn, then coming to the English Court.99 On May 12, 1204, we find him in attendance on the King at Southwick, in Hampshire. On October 15, 1204, King John writes to William fitz Alan concerning the custody of several | 98 Rot. Liberate, p. 91. 99 Rot. Patent, p. 39. 96 Oblata, p. 147. 97 Anglia Sacra, II. p. 566."], [274, "244 UPTON MAGNA. hostages, given on behalf of Lewellyn. The King approved of cer tain Barons Marchers, already nominated to be Keepers of these hostages ; but if the Keepers were changed, the King desired to know who were to be substituted.1 On December 24, 1205, Wil liam fitz Alan was in King John's Court at Oxford, and there deli vered to the King two Coursers (catzuros), part of a Fine which he had promised to the King.3 A Writ of February 11, 1206, shows William fitz Alan rendering up, by order of the King, certain Welsh hostages, whom he had in keeping, and who were now to be en trusted to William de Cantilupe, Walter de Clifford, and another.3 On November 3, 1207, William fitz Alan appears in King John's Court at Malmesbury. On October 8, 1208, a Treaty was nego tiated at Shrewsbury, whereby King John, on receipt of 20 hos tages, was to enlarge Wenhunwyn son of Hoen de Keveliac, then his prisoner. William fitz Alan, William de Cantilupe, Robert Corbet, Hugh Pantulf, and John le Strange, were witnesses of the bargain.4 At the Forest Assizes of March 1209, William fitz Alan's name comes into frequent mention. Among other things he is charged for certain imbladements in the Long Forest. We have only one authority (a Register of Dunstable Priory) which directly states the year of William fitz Alan's death.5 It gives it as in 1210, and all secondary evidences corroborate the date. It is probable that he was buried at Haughmond Abbey, for the Chartulary of that House contains a Deed whereby William, son of William fitz Alan, confirmed, for the souls of himself, his ancestors, and his heirs, together with his body, to that Abbey, all the land he had in Downton. He further gave with his body, all his wood, lying between the road, which led from the Abbey towards Shaw bury, and the wood of Uffington. This Deed, which we must assume to have passed in 1210, was attested by Sir Huctrad, Abbot of Build was ; Sir Ralph, Abbot of Lilleshull ; John le Strange ; Robert Corbet; Hugh Pantulf ; Reiner de Lee; Hugh de Beccheberi ; and Warner de Wililey.6 I now propose to notice those Charters of the second William fitz Alan, which I shall not be able to introduce under any appropriate locality, but which are nevertheless illustrative of his personal his tory. His earliest Deeds are perhaps those already alluded to under Buildwas Abbey, as having passed about 1175, and as being 1 * ' \u25a0 3 Rot. Claus.

One of these Char ters (that relating to Brockton Grange in Staffordshire) is attested by John le Strange and John his son ; by Wido le Strange, and Wido and Hamo his sons ; by Thomas Noel ; Richard de Stane wrdin; Marescot, and Henry and Hamo his sons; Ralph Hose; Henry Malveisin ; William de Bruna ; Adam de Erleton ; Her bert de Brelectun; Roger Muisun and Ralph de Cleia.7 The Seal of this Deed has the effigy of a knight on horseback. I annex an Engraving thereof, together with an Engraving of two Seals used by the same Baron, one about the year 1184, the other about the year 1200.8 A comparison of the three will show the change, in some points, of military costume rather than any improvement in the Engraver's art. It is further to be noted that in all three Deeds the Grantor styles himself as \" William, son of William fitz Alan.\" The same person, calling himself \"William fitz Alan,\" expedited two Charters to the Oxfordshire Priory of Cold Norton. Both Charters are attested by Robert Corbet, Reyner de Le, and Warner de Withel (read Wililey), and both passed between the years 1203 and 1210, the only period during which the Grantor was seized of Norton.9 These Charters are printed elsewhere,10 but one of them is most inaccurately entitled De fundatione. Lastly, under this subject of Charters, I should notice a Grant by William, son of William fitz Alan, to Shrewsbury Abbey. It was of 12s. rent out of the Grantor's Manor of Stoke (probably in Sussex), to provide lights for the High Altar. It passed evidently between the years 1203 and 1210, and probably at the end of that period. Ralph Abbot of Lilleshull, Ralph Abbot of Haghmon, John le Strange, Robert de Gireus, and Reiner de Lee attested it.11 At his decease in 1210 William fitz Alan (II.) left two sons, Wil liam and John, and two daughters, Agnes and Petronilla, \u2014 all pro bably infants at the time, though the two sons had attested more phen, King of England. Earl Reginald forfeited all bis English estates in 1202 by his adherence to Philip Augustus ; and in 1202-3 William fitz Alan recovered Norton, sicut jus suum, by a Fine with King John. The Fine alludes to the lapsed tenure of the Earl of Boulogne, but to ac count for the previous cessation of Fitz Alan's rights I am unable. 10 Monasticon, VI. p. 420, Nos.

Under that Manor I shall give the contents of the Deed. 9 Norton (Oxfordshire) was a Domesday Manor of Ernulf de Hesding.

Agnes fitz Alan's husband was Philip, son of Simon de Kime. Twenty Librates of land and rents constituted the marriage-portion assigned to her by her Father ; and it would seem that the Oxford shire Manor of Norton was charged with the burden. But, in May 1212, Reginald, Earl of Boulogne, returned to the allegiance of King John ; and Norton, with all the stock which the Earl had had there, when disseized thereof in 1202, was restored to him. Hence we have a Writ of the King dated November 23, 1213, ordering John Mareschall to value twenty librates of land and rents, out of the es tates of the late William fitz Alan, for Philip, son of Simon de Kyme, in lieu of those twenty Librates which Fitz Alan had given to his daughter in marriage, and which the King had restored to the Earl of Boulogne.12 Of the further history of the Baronial family of Kyme, sometime Lords of Kesteven in Lincolnshire, I forbear to speak. Petronilla fitz Alan, another of the children of William fitz Alan (II.) , was in April 1213, wife of the second Walter de Dun stanvill of Idsall. Of her and her descendants I have treated else where.13 I now pass to \u2014 WILLIAM FITZ ALAN III.,\u2014 eldest son and heir of William fitz Alan II. \u2014 The first event which I shall notice during this youth's minority is King John's invasion of North Wales, the last of two invasions which the King undertook in 1211. The King went and returned by way of Oswestry, where we find him to have been on July 8th and August 15th. The Welsh Chronicle assures us that John, son of William fitz Alan, was at this crisis Lord of Oswestry.14 This sub stitution of the heir eventual for the heir existent must not mislead us. It only proves that parts of the Welsh Chronicle were not ob tained from any cotemporary authority. It is probable that the Castles and Estates of Fitz Alan were at the time in custody of the Crown. The King's expedition was a successful one, and he brought home certain hostages. In August 1212 we have seen that Oswestry Castle was in the keeping of Robert de Vipont. It is probable that all Fitz Alan's Shropshire estates were entrusted to the same person, 13 Vide Rot. Claus. I. pp. 116,117,140, I 155. I 13 Supra, Vol. II. pp. 288, 293, 297. >\u00ab Powell, p. 191."], [281, "247 WILLIAM FITZ ALAN III. of whom I have already given some particulars, especially how in the same month of August he was the Executioner of one of the Welsh hostages of the preceding year.16 The Fine-Roll of King John's 14th year (ending May 22, 1213) is lost, but one of its entries is preserved on the Pipe-Roll of 16 John, which contains all the Shropshire Fines, proffered between Michaelmas 1212 and Michaelmas 1214. This entry implies that before May 22, 1213, William, son of WiUiani fitz Alan, proffered to the King the enormous sum of 10,000 merks that he might have the lands of his said Father, except such lands as his Father had given to his daughter Petronilla. The whole Fine was entered as a debt at Michaelmas 1214, no instalment having been paid thereon. In fact it was ultimately abortive, though we have evidence that on one occasion at least the King respected it as valid ; \u2014 for on June 10, 1213, the King orders Robert de Vipont to deliver to John Mareschall custody of the Castles of Oswestry and Shrawardine, and of the land which had been William fitz Alan's, \" saving however to William, son and heir of the said William, the Fine which he had made with the King for the same land.\" 16 On November 10, 1213, King John presented to Shrawardine Church, \" because Fitz Alan's lands were in manu Regis,\" \u2014 a proof that no livery had as yet been accorded to the heir. John Mare schall continued Custos of the Shropshire Castles and estates of Fitz Alan eight months longer, and I presume that it was in consequence of the Heir finding it impossible to complete his engagements, that the King had recourse to other means of raising money on this valuable wardship. In the beginning of July 1214, Thomas de Er dinton purchased it from the King for a fine of 5000 merks. The following conditions of the bargain I gather from collating the mutilated Fine-Roll with the Shropshire Pipe-Roll of that year. \u2014 Erdinton was to have the land, late William Fitz Alan's, together with the marriage of his sons and heirs ; the elder son was to marry Erdington's daughter, but, in case of the elder son's death, the younger son was to take her to wife. Erdiugton was to pay 2000 merks in the first year of his guardianship, and to find Sureties for the balance of 3000 merks. As soon as this was done, the mar riage, first provided for, was to take place at once, or, if young Fitz Alan were sooner deceased, then the other marriage. Erdington was himself to hold all Fitz Alan's lands for a full term of five years. 15 Supra, Vol. I. pp. 270, 271. | \"* Rot. Patent, p. 100."], [282, "248 UPTON MAGNA. The Sureties for a greater part of the above sum of 3000 merks may be gathered from the Fine-Roll. The first Security was for 500 merks. It was probably that of the Earl of Chester, though his name is obliterated. Hubert de Burgh, Nicholas de Verdun, Walter de Clifford, John de Monemuc, Hugh de Mortimer, Henry de Vere, Walter de Lacy, and Robert Marmion, were also Sureties for sums of various amount. King John was at this time in France. He therefore ordered Peter, Bishop of Winchester (then Justiciar or Viceroy) , to give Erdington full seizin of all Fitz Alan's lands, and of Oswestry Cas tle, directly his Securities were completed. Erdington was further empowered to levy a scutage of 3 merks per fee on the military Tenants of Fitz Alan's Fief.17 Another Writ of King John bears date at Rochelle on July 11, 1214. It orders John Marescall, on receiving the further mandate of the Bishop of Winchester, to deliver up the above-named lands and Castle to Erdington. Again, a Writ of August 19, 1214, dated at Coignac, informs the Bishop, that, out of the 3000 merks, only 270 remained unsecured by Sureties. It further provides that if the scutage of Poitou (at 3 merks per fee) had already been levied on Fitz Alan's Tenants, the product was to go to Erdington's credit in liquidation of his Fine.18 , On September 7, 1214, the Bishop of Winchester issues diverse Writs, administrative of the Royal Writs (de ultra mare) received by himself, and relating to the contract with Erdington; e.g. the Barons of the Exchequer are to credit Erdington with the sum re ceived off Fitz Alan's Fief for the scutage of Poitou ; \u2014 the Sheriffs of Norfolk, Wiltshire, Warwickshire and Leicestershire, Shropshire and Staffordshire, are to allow Erdington to levy a further Aid of 4 merks de scuto on the Fitz Alan Tenants in their respective districts, to enable him to pay his Fine ; \u2014 lastly, the Sheriff of Shropshire and Staffordshire is to find Sureties for the still unsecured sum of 270 merks, and to give Erdington seizin, the rest of his Securities being certified by the Bishop as complete.19 Now it probably was, that William fitz Alan (III.) married Mary, the daughter of Thomas de Erdington, and the event will show that the very haste with which this match was hurried on, ended in the frustration of Erdington's whole scheme. He looked \u00ab Rot. Finium, p. 531. I 19 Claus. I. 212. 18 Claus. I. 170."], [283, "249 WILLIAM FITZ ALAN III. to be the Ancestor of the future line of Fitz Alan. He fenced his expectation with all that money, interest, and human foresight could provide. All however that eventually resulted to his daughter was the dower of a childless Widow. On March 3, 1215, King John, then at the Tower of London, received the homage of William fitz Alan, and addressed Letters- Patent to all the Knights and Tenants of the young Baron, ordering them to do homage and fealty to their Lord ; but a clause in the Writ reserves all the rights of Thomas de Erdington, accruing from his Fine and Convention with the King.20 It is probable that in the following month (April 1215) William fitz Alan died. A high authority quotes an undated Writ or Certi ficate, which stated that \" William fitz Alan, being at Clun in com pany with his brother John, died there at Easter last (ad hanc Pas cham).\"21 It is obvious that Easter 1215 is the time here alluded to. Easter-day fell on April 19th in that year; and, when Matthew Paris enumerates John fitz Alan among the confederate Barons who met at Brackley on April 27th following, we are assured that such a notoriety can only have attached to John fitz Alan, as the repre sentative of his house, and in consequence of his elder Brother's death. The haste with which the young Baron threw himself into the ranks of the Anti-royalists is easily accounted for. \u2014 Was he to submit to the same coercion which had been practised on his unfor tunate Brother? Were his Estates to be enjoyed by Erdington for four years yet to come, and he himself to be married to another of Erdington's daughters, or else re-marketed among the would-be Fathers-in-Law of the King's party ? The rebellion of John fitz Alan was as excusable as his youth and circumstances could make it. We shall see that he eventually chose a wife for himself, a lady whose expectations were small at the time, but whose children's in heritance was nothing less than an Earldom. But I must return for a moment to speak of the Widow of the third William fitz Alan. She had for her dower the Oxfordshire Manor of Norton and the whole Honour of Mileham in Norfolk. Hence a Writ of King Henry III., dated October 13, 1217, orders 20 Rot. Patent, p. 129, b. death of William fitz Alan (III.). As the subject must be resumed under Oswestry, I shall only state here, that the Writ con firms my idea that John fitz Alan rebelled instantly after his brother's death ; in fact he had seized Oswestry Castle before the King had heard of William's decease. 21 Tierney's History of Arundel, p. 194. Since I wrote the above, Mr. Tierney has communicated to me full particulars of this very remarkable Writ. It was addressed by King John to the Sheriff of Salop and Staffordshire, soon after the 33 VII."], [284, "250 UPTON MAGNA. the Sheriff of Oxfordshire to *give seizin to Thomas de Erdington of the Manor of Nortun, \" which was of the dower of his daughter Mary, out of the lands of William fitz Alan, late her husband.\"2 Another Writ of October 30, 1217, gives Thomas de Erdington power to levy scutage on his Tenants in Norfolk and Suffolk.23 On March 20, 1218, Thomas de Erdington, having taken the cowl of a monk, died at Worcester ;24 and two days afterwards his widow, Roese de Cokefield, obtained possession, from Henry III., of Mary de Erdington's dower in Mileham.26 Another Writ of November 10, 1218, shows that the two Hundreds of Landich and Sudgreneho were appurtenances of Mileham, and so were a part of the same dower.26 JOHN EITZ ALAN (I.). As early as August 28, 1212, we have a notice of \" John son of William fitz Alan,\" as he is called. He was then in the service either of King John or of the Earl of Salisbury ; for the King, then at Scrooby, had entrusted him with 25 merks, due to the Earl as Custos of certain Royal Castles.27 His succession to his elder bro ther, and his defection from King John, belong, as I have said, to the month of April 1215. On August 2, 1215, King John was at Worcester, and John fitz Alan was in occupation of the Royal Castle of Stretton. I presume that this was in defiance of the King, though the Letter which the King wrote on the subject does not determine the matter. It merely commands John fitz Alan to give without delay such seizin of the King's Castle of Stratton to William Barat, deputy of Hugh de Nevill, as the said William had before the King had quarrelled with his Barons.28 The following year (1216) King John was at Oswestry from the 6th to the 10th of August. He burnt the town, if not the Castle, to the ground. The Historians of Shrewsbury have supposed this measure to have been a precaution lest the place should fall into the hands of Fulk fitz Warin;29 but it was much more probably a stroke of direct vengeance on John fitz Alan. On October 3rd, King John presented to Cound Church, claiming the patronage in virtue of the attainder of John fitz Alan, his enemy.30 a Claus.

On April 20, 1217, King Henry III. gives John fitz Alan's Wiltshire Manor of Kivele to John Marescall, to support him in the King's service, and for so long as the King should please.31 But in October following he had made his peace, for then the King empowers him to collect the scutage of his Te nants in Warwickshire, Wiltshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Oxfordshire, and Shropshire.32 This reconciliation is more plainly declared in a Writ of No vember 14, following ; for thereby the Sheriff of Shropshire is or dered \" to give John fitz Alan such seizin of his estates as Thomas de Erdington had, on the day when he fined with King John, for the marriage of William fitz Alan, John's brother.\"33 Similar Writs were directed to the Sheriffs of Warwickshire, Sussex, Ox fordshire, Wiltshire, Norfolk, and Staffordshire. This shows how completely Erdington's schemes had been frustrated, for he himself was still living ; and the five-years' tenure of Fitz Alan's lands, which King John had promised him, had nearly two years to run. In November 1219 a question as to the Crown-debts of John fitz Alan was referred by the King to the Barons of the Exchequer. They were to decide whether he was responsible for whatever was due of Erdington's Fine with King John ; also, whether he was responsible for his quota of some unspecified scutage in Shropshire ; and lastly, whether he ought to pay that \u00a3174. which had long since been charged on his Father, for deficiency in the stores left by him on quitting office as Sheriff, and which deficiency (as we have seen) his Father had thrown back on Hugh Pantulf.34 I have not thought it worth while to inquire how these questions were de cided. Such debts were seldom paid, and the Pipe-Rolls are silent as to the liquidation of those under notice.35 On January 26, 1220, we find that John fitz Alan had left Eno-land on a pilgrimage to the Shrine of St. James (of Compos- 31 . 32 . 33 Sot.

Thus as late as 1221, the Pipe-Roll charges John fitz Alan with the great Fine of 10,000 merks, proffered eight years before by his brother ; but this charge disappears from succeeding Rolls, without any evidence or probability of its liquidation. The entry was of course a mere mistake, as the Fine in question had been virtually cancelled by Erdington's Fine."], [286, "252 UPTON MAGNA. tella) . Writs of protection from all suits, etc., till his return, were addressed to the Sheriffs of Wiltshire and Shropshire.36 On Febru ary 19, 1221, he was empowered to collect his own scutage, he having been at the Siege of Biham with the King.37 On February 11, 1225, he attests at Westminster the Carta de Forestis of Henry III., and in May following he was on the Committee which was to con vey the tax of the Fifteenth from Shrewsbury to Gloucester. At the close of the year ] 233 I find evidence on the Patent-Roll of some mistrust entertained by the King against John fitz Alan. His Castle of Clun was in custody of a Nominee of the Crown, and he himself had to give hostages for his fidelity. One of these hos tages, being confided to the care of John le Strange, was restored to Fitz Alan by a Writ of February 6, 1234. The others were liberated by the Sheriff of Shropshire, pursuant to a Patent of May 15, fol lowing. A Patent of March 8, 1238, orders John fitz Alan, Wal ter de Clifford, and Herbert fitz Peter, to take measures, preventive of any danger which might threaten the King's territory from the insolence of Lewellyn. The exact date of John fitz Alan's death is nowhere stated, but may be proximately determined by the following documents. \u2014 On March 15, 1240, Writs- Close were addressed to the Sheriffs of Sussex, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Oxfordshire, Warwickshire, Cheshire, Staffordshire, and Shropshire, relative to the assignment of the dower of Hawyse de Albo Monasterio, widow of John fitz Alan. A Writ of March 30th, enjoins John le Strange to assign the Shropshire part of such dower elsewhere than in Oswestry, Shrawardine, or Clun.38 A Writ of June 16, 1240, allots the follow ing Manors (of demesne) for the dowry in question, viz. Trogford (Cheshire), Kyvelegh (Wiltshire), Cound, Acton (Round), Wrbxeter, Upton (Magna), Nesse cum Mulford, Edenesdon (Ensdon), Forton, and Wallegh (all in Shropshire) . Lastly a Writ of June 19, 1240, assigns to the same Hawyse, her dower in the knight's services which went to form her late husband's Barony. This allotment was made up of the services of 2\\ fees in Warwickshire, \\ a fee in Ox fordshire, \\\\ fees in Shropshire, 1 fee in Gloucestershire, 4^ fees in Staffordshire, about 3 fees in Wiltshire, and 2 fees in Cheshire, ap purtenant to the Manor of Trogford.39 John fitz Alan (I.) had been twice married. His first wife, and the mother of his son and heir (John), was Isabel, sister, and in her issue coheir, of Hugh de Albini, last Earl of Arundel of his line ; but, whereas the said Earl 38 * 3? Claus.

Hugh did not die till 12 13, the coheirship of his Sister Isabel was not determined till after her own and her husband's death. The second wife of John fitz Alan (I.) was Hawyse de Blancminster. She survived her husband but a short time, and was deceased before September 19, 1242,40 when her dower devolved to the estate of her step-son John fitz Alan (IL), who was a Minor at the time. Hence a Patent of October 3, 1242, empowers John le Strange to put out at farm the demesne lands, late held by Hawyse, widow of John fitz Alan, in dower. JOHN FITZ ALAN IL, with whom my narrative proceeds, appears to have been born about May 1223. In his father's lifetime he was married to Matilda, daughter of Theobald le Butiler and Rohese de Verdon. At his father's death, in 1240, he was of course in minority. Accordingly, from June 16 to September 29, 1240, the Shropshire estates of John fitz Alan, deceased, were (with the exception of the dower of his widow) in the hands of John le Strange, Sheriff of Shropshire, who acknowledges himself responsible for the issues of the \" Manors and Castles \" of Oswestry, Clun, Shrawardine, and Montford, during that period. A similar responsibility continues to be acknowledged by John le Strange on the Pipe-Rolls of 1241, 1242, 1243, and 1244. Meanwhile, that is, in October 1242, the Executors of John fitz Alan deceased, were suing Roese de Verdon for certain moneys said to be due to his estate. It is probable that these moneys constituted her daughter's fortune, for Roese de Verdon fined 5 merks with the King to prevent the said Executors distraining for this debt, till it could be shown whether the debt was indeed due to the deceased, and not rather to John fitz Alan, son of the deceased, and son-in law of the said Roese.41 We are assured that John fitz Alan (II.) , though still in minority, did homage at the close of the year 1243.43 However, on February 8, 1244, when Earl Hugh de Albini's Manor of Waderington was to be divided among his four Coheirs, the share of his Nephew, John fitz Alan, was retained in the King's hands because he was still in ward to the Crown.43 The Writ certifying his arrival at majority bears date May 3, 1244. He then fined \u00a31000. for livery and seizin of his Father's lands and Castles. Orders were issued accordingly 42 Til -ney's irundel, p. IliSlfc.^a^ 43 Rot. Fin. I. 411. e-TlF- 40 Rot.

Before Michaelmas 1245 three-fourths of John fitz Alan's Fine of \u00a31000. had been paid. In the partition of the Estates of Earl Hugh de Albini, Arundel Castle fell to his share; and further, the Seigneury of 22\u00a3 knights' -fees which William de Percy held under the Earls of Arundel, and which constituted that Honour of Petworth, which has already been mentioned in these pages.45 Arundel Castle was given into his hands by a Patent of May 24, 1244. In August 1253 John fitz Alan was apparently one of those Barons who accompanied King Henry III. into Gascony, for his name is among those who had the Letters of Protection usual on such occasions. Moreover a Charter dated at Bazats on January 28, 1254, gives him the privilege of Free-Warren in a number of Manors which appear to have been of his demesne, and some of which I here enumerate, endeavouring to fix the Counties in which they lay. Upton (Upton Magna), Wroxeter, Cound, Harnage, Acton (Acton Round), Rodington and Shrawardine seem to belong to Shropshire. Norton (in Oxfordshire), Lavinton (in Wiltshire), Troghford (in Cheshire), and Stokes (in Sussex) seem to be also in dicated in the list.46 Some others I shall identify and speak of on a future occasion. In the Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 Upton Magna is entered as Hupton. \u2014 John fitz Alan was Lord thereof, and held it in capite of the King as a member of the Barony of Oswaldistre. He did suit to the County, but not to the Hundred.47 John fitz Alan (II.) , in regard to public services, makes no con spicuous figure in the Records of his time. In 1258, indeed, he was made Captain-General of all the forces designed for guarding the Marches ; but, two years later, his authority in the West was made secondary to that of Roger de Mortimer.48 In June 1259 he was on a Commission, to settle some breaches of truce between the King and Lewellyn, and generally to treat of peace. In a quarrel which he had with Shrewsbury Abbey in 1260, he is styled \" Lord of Arundel,\" but I do not find that the title of Earl was accorded to him or his 44 Rot.

The assumption that the possession of Arundel Castle constituted an Earldom-by-Tenure, though it may rest on a legal decision, and though it is supported by some strong considerations, does not rest on any basis of invariable use. A Pa tent of April 29, 1263, gives protection to John fitz Alan, and to Vivian de Roshal and John de Chetwynd (two of his chief Vassals), so long as they should be with Prince Edward in the parts of Wales. A Patent of December 24, 1263, names John fitz Alan, Roger de Mortimer, John de Verdon, James de Audley, and Hamo le Strange as Keepers of the Peace in Shropshire and Staffordshire. If the proverb, noscitur a sociis, involve an invariable truth, Fitz Alan was a Royalist of the first class. He was one of the Barons who under Roger de Leyburne held Rochester Castle against Montfort in April 1264.49 He also fought for the Crown at Lewes on the disastrous 14th of May, and, as Matthew Paris relates, was taken Prisoner. It is that Historian who styles him Earl of Arundel. One of the Pseudo-Patents of the period next ensuing bears date at Canterbury on September 18, 1264. The captive King is repre sented as ordering John fitz Alan and others to quarter themselves, with horses and arms, at Pevensey, and there to be aiding Simon de Montfort the younger in besieging that Castle and subduing the King's enemies. It would seem then that at this critical juncture Sussex, and not Shropshire, was the abode of the most powerful, if not the most distinguished, of the Barons Marchers. Another Pseudo- Patent of April 26, 1265, is a witness that John fitz Alan was mis trusted by Montfort's faction. The King is represented as ordering that he should either give up his son, as a hostage for his fidelity, to young Simon de Montfort, or else, if his son was not with him, that he should give up Arundel Castle as a security. The Will of this John fitz Alan is in part preserved. It bears date at Wroxeter on Thursday, October 6, 1267. He styles him self \" Lord of Arundel,\" and being of sound mind and counsel, bequeaths his body to be buried with his predecessors at Haghnion, in a place already prepared. He gives \u00a320. and his Cross in 49 Dugdale (quoting Leland's Collec tanea, Vol. I. p. 321) implies that the Barons who held Rochester Castle in April 1264, were on the Rebel side, John fitz Alan being one of them. This is a mis construction of the Chronicle transcribed by Leland. The Barons who defended Rochester Castle were for the Crown.

He gives, with his body to Haghmon Abbey, his Mill of Muleford and two carucates of land in Upton ; also one of his Destriers, accoutred fully and honourably as for a Knight.60 It is evident that this Will was made in prospect of his ap proaching end, for the Writ of Diem clausit, on his death, is dated November 10, 1267. His lands, by a Writ of the same date, were committed to the Escheator-citra-Trent.51 His widow, Matilda de Verdon, survived him, and remarried to Richard de Mundeville, as I have before related.52 I should here add that Upton Magna was part of this lady's dower. At the Inquest of 1278, the Jurors found that the Haye of Uptone, pertaining to the Manor of Upton, and not being within the King's Forest, had been wasted by Mundeville and his wife ; also that the Bosc, called Duntones clive (Downton Cliff), in the Forest of Hawemon, had been wasted by Henry de Rodinton, Wood-warden-of-the-Fee therein. The said Wood-warden having absented himself, the Sheriff was ordered to arrest him, and keep him in prison till further orders. The woods also were seized into the King's hand. The Inquest which sat at Upton Magna on December 18, 1283, and on the death of Matilda de Verdon, valued the Manor as worth \u00a312. 19s. 5d. per annum. Richard fitz Alan, grandson of the de ceased, was, as I have said under Acton Round, her heir. I now turn to \u2014 JOHN FITZ ALAN (III.),\u2014 son and heir of John fitz Alan (II.) and Matilda de Verdon. This John fitz Alan was born on September 14, 1245, as I gather from the Inquest on his father's death.53 Consequently he was at the latter period more than twenty-two years of age. Accordingly, on December 10, 1267, the King accepted his homage, and issued the usual Writ, ordering the Escheator to take security for his Relief, and to give him seizin of his inheritance. The said Relief was only \u00a3100., for his Barony in Shropshire and elsewhere, and \u00a325., for his fourth share of the Barony of the Earls of Arundel.54 50 Haughmond Chartulary, Tit.

I have given the Fine or Settlement then made on the Infant couple,55 and would merely observe that while the said Fine states John fitz Alan to have been under 14 years of age at the time when it was levied, the Inquest on his Father's death would make it appear that he was more than 14, though under 15.56 The Fine is obviously the best authority, and we may thus learn to suspect whether Provincial Juries were not apt to overstate the age of an heir in order to exclude all pretence of the Crown to wardship. On December 27, 1268, \" John son of John fitz Alan,\" as he styles himself, confirmed to Haghmon Abbey the grant of Muleford Mill which his Father had given \" with his body, \u2014 to be buried in that Monastery.\" A King's Writ, bearing date April 12, 1269, shows something of she character of the third John fitz Alan, but more of the enormous privi leges which were occasionally asserted by the Lords of the Marches. The Writ recites that John fitz Alan (II.) had died in debt to the Crown ; that the King had granted \u00a3200. of the said debt to Ma tilda, widow of the deceased, to be levied on his goods and chattels, and to be by her bestowed on the poor for the health of his soul : further that John fitz Alan (III.), having undertaken to pay his father's Crown-debts by instalments of \u00a3100. per annum, had been allowed to take possession of his Father's goods ; but, though he had been repeatedly ordered to pay the above \u00a3200. to his Father's widow, he delayed to do so, asserting in contempt of the King, that in the Parts of the March where he now resided, he was obliged to do nothing at the King's mandate, and that nothing would he do. The King is hereat \" surprised and greatly moved.\" He orders the Treasurer and Barons of the Exchequer to levy the said \u00a3200. on the goods of the Recusant, according to Exchequer cus tom and law, and to give the proceeds to Matilda.57 We have seen in a former Volume that within a month after the above Writ, viz. on May 6, 1269, John fitz Alan was at Arundel Castle.58 By a Patent of January 1, 1271, the King, at instance of Roger de Mortimer, cancels a certain debt which John fitz Alan owed correct, but I know not the authority for the date.

Himself in the prime of life, his son and heir, Richard, was now a mere Infant, five years old, having been born on February 3, 1267.59 The Inquisition on John fitz Alan's death, though it surveyed the members of his Barony of Oswestry, does not seem to have noticed Upton or Wroxeter, pro bably because they were held in dower by his mother Matilda. I have said or implied that there is no authoritative instance of this John fitz Alan having assumed, or being directly described by, the Title of Earl, in his lifetime. Dug dale assures us that his son Richard came to enjoy the title, as being seized of Arundel Castle, and without any formal Creation or other Investiture. Of this I think there cannot be a doubt ; but when Dugdale proceeds to say that \" John fitz Alan had the Title,\" that statement requires qualification. All that Dugdale proves on the point is that King Edward I. in 1307, speaking of the hereditary debts of Edmund, then Earl of Arundel, describes them as debts which stood on the Rolls of the Exchequer under the name of John fitz Alan, formerly Earl of Arundel, ancestor of the said Edmund. Here I take it that the words quondam comitis Arundelli\u00e6, etc., are not cited verbatim from any Exchequer Roll, and never stood thereon, but that King Edward used them as explanatory of his intention, and perhaps under an impression that the third John fitz Alan had assumed the title. I must here defend my view of this question from a very possible and obvious objection. A Patent of Henry III.'s, dated February 18, 1272, that is one month before the death of John fitz Alan (III.), is addressed to \" Isa bella, Countess of Arundel.\" Now, if this were Isabella, wife of John fitz Alan (III.), it would follow by implication that her husband was recognized as Earl in his lifetime. But the fact, is that the Lady, here addressed, was not Isabella de Mortimer, but Isabel widow of Hugh de Albini, last Earl of his line, which Isabel survived her husband nearly forty years, and died in the year 1282. It has always been my impression that this very thing, viz. the prolonged existence of this Dowager Countess, operated to sup press the revival of the Earldom till after Earl Hugh de Albini's Great-Great-Nephew (Richard fitz Alan) had obtained his majority. Isabel de Mortimer, with whom I now proceed, is spoken of in a Patent of May 18, 1272, just in the way in which the above con siderations would lead us to expect, viz. as Isabella qua suit uxor Johannis filii Alani. The Patent reciting that her dowry had not been awarded, because Extent was yet to be made of her late hus band's Estates, proceeds nevertheless to give her a third of all ward ships and Escheats which might accrue instantly, out of the said Estates. Another Patent of the same 18th day of May, promises to Roger de Mortimer (Isabella's father) one of Fitz Alan's Castles, and 100 Librates of Fitz Alan's lands, \u2014 to hold during the minority of the heir. If Mortimer died in the interval, the grant was to be made good to his Executors, and, if the King died, his heir was to be bound by his promise.

A Patent of August 6, 1272, first recites the former Patent, and then assigns to Roger de Mortimer the Castle and Manor of Clun, yielding \u00a382. 9s. 5^d. per annum, also rents of \u00a36. 7s. 9|rf. issuing from Edeneston, a member of Shrawardine, and \u00a311. 2s. 9d. per annum, being two thirds of the produce of Oswestry Mills. In 1273 the wardship of young Richard fitz Alan was given to Roger de Mortimer of Wigmore (his grand father) ; but on June 3, 1280, Isabel de Mortimer obtained custody of the Castle and Honour of Arundel during the rest of her son's minority. She was to hold this trust, together with \u00a335. 10s. 6d. income, from lands and rents in Westden and Cherleton, and from a moiety of the Hundred of Stokbrugg, which income the King had previously assigned to her ; but she was to pay a rent of \u00a3100. per annum to the King for the grant.60 It seems that Dame Isabel also became Fermor under the Crown of the Castle and Hundred of Os westry, but the following Writs show that she was not permitted to retain such important trusts for the whole period of her son's mino rity. On August 10, 1282, King Edward, then at Rhuddlan, com mits the Castle and Manor of Oswaldestre, till the heir should be of age, to Edmund de Mortimer (Isabel's brother); \u2014 and Roger Spring hose, being then Custos of the said Castle, was ordered to deliver it up accordingly. For this trust Edmund de Mortimer was to pay an annual rent of 200 merks to the Abbot of Vale Royal, \u2014 that noble Foundation in Cheshire on which the King was then bestow ing a munificent patronage. The same Edmund de Mortimer was also to receive, from the hands of his sister, the Castle and Honour of Arundel, and to pay a further rent of \u00a3100. for that trust to the aforesaid Abbot.61 On November 7, 1282, King Edward, still at Rhuddlan, orders the Barons of his Exchequer to audit the account of Isabel, widow of John fitz Alan, for such period as she had been Custos of Oswestry Castle, and to allow her all the mises and ex penses which she had bestowed on the fortifications of the same, since the commencement of the existing war with Wales. The King further certifies, that Isabel had, out of the ferms of the Castle and Hundred of Oswaldistre, and the Castle of Arundel, paid \u00a3668. 10s. to the Abbot of Vale Royal, by the King's order, and \" towards the works of the said Abbey, which the King had founded.\"63 At this time Isabel de Mortimer had taken a second husband, viz.

Richard fitz Alan, having been born, as I have said, on February 3, 1267, cannot have attained his actual majority till the same day in 1288. Nevertheless it is clear that he had livery of his inherit ance much earlier, though I cannot name the exact period of his obtaining it. The Feodary of 1284 usually styles him Richard fitz Alan, but in one or two instances as the Heir of John fitz Alan. His tenure of many Manors in capite, and, amongst the rest, of the Manor of Upton cum membris, is registered without allusion to his nonage. For proof that he was in full possession of Arundel in 1285, I refer elsewhere,65 as also for a list of his military sum monses,66 the earliest of which, addressed to him in 1287 and 1288, relate to the cotemporary rebellion of Rese ap Meredyth, and order his Bailiffs to levy forces for the suppression of the same, while he himself is desired to reside on his Lordships till that end should be accomplished. At the Assizes of 1292, that is, in October of that year, I first find him styled Earl of Arundel.

He pleaded (by Attorney) his right of holding two Great Courts wherein questions of the Peace were recognizable, and also of having weyf and infangenthef ; \u2014 all which he justified by usage immemorial of his Ancestors. As to any other Franchises or Pleas of the Crown, he claimed them not. The King's Attorney replied as to Weyf, that it could not be justified by usage, without special warranty of the Crown, seeing that it was a right inherent in the Crown; moreover, that the Earl claimed none of those Pleas of the Crown to which weyf was ordinarily appurtenant. The cause was ultimately adjourned for hearing Coram Rege.m In October 1294, Richard Earl of Arundel was appointed Com mander of the Forces destined for the relief of Bere Castle, whilst Roger le Strange, Peter Corbet, Fulk fitz Warin, and Bogo de Knovile were ordered to muster under his command. His first Summons to Parliament bears date August 1, 1295, and therein he is duly entitled Earl of Arundel. His latest Military Summons was against the Scots, and was returnable at Carlisle on June 24, 1301. The King's Writ of Diem Clausit, on the death of Richard Fitz Alan, Earl of Arundel, bears date January 15, 1302. In the Inquests held soon after, Edmund, his son and heir, was found to have been 18 years of age on May 1, 1301.68 The wife of Earl Richard fitz Alan is said by Dugdale to have been Alizon, daughter of the Marquis of Saluce, an Italian. It is evident that this marriage was consummated long before Richard fitz Alan attained his ma jority, in fact, before he had completed his sixteenth year; for his son Edmund was born within three months after that anniversary. This alleged marriage of Richard Fitz Alan to an Italian Lady invites another observation. It must have taken place nearly at the same time as the marriage of his Uncle, Edmund de Mortimer of Wigmore, who, as we have seen, married a Spaniard. The pa rallel does not end here. The eldest sons of either marriage be came deadly foes. They died within five years of each other, both by the hands of the Executioner, and Fitz Alan by the contrivance of Mortimer. Some particulars of the minority of Edmund Fitz Alan, son and heir of Earl Richard, have been given under Acton Round.69 For a sketch of his career and his tragical end I must refer elsewhere,70 inasmuch as the history of this family and Earldom becomes at this 63 Supra, Vol. IV. p. 123. 6?

Suffice it to say that, owing to his marriage with Alice Plantagenet, Edmund Fitz Alan's de scendants became entitled to the Earldom of Warren and Surrey, \u2014 an honour fully equal to those of their paternal inheritance. Having now given some account of eight successive representa tives of Alan fitz Flaald, this retrospective observation suggests it self, viz. that not one of these eight Fitz Alans attained the age of sixty years ; only two passed the age of fifty ; three died between forty and fifty, one between thirty and forty ; the two others died under thirty. SCUTAGES OF THE BARONY OF OSWESTRY. Under every Tenure-in-capite I have given some account of the Scutages and other services to which that Tenure was liable in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. I propose here to continue that plan and to review the liabilities of this greatest of Shropshire Fiefs with some degree of care. We have seen that in 1165 the Barony of Oswestry, including its appurtenances in Warwickshire and Staffordshire, was parcelled out by feoffments into 39\u00a3 knights' -fees, or the equivalent of that num ber, and that the Baron of Oswestry owed the personal services of ten knights in any array within the County of Salop, and of five knights without the same County. The last liability seems to have been scarcely maintained ; for in the Inquest on the death of John fitz Alan (II.) in 1267 it is stated indeed that the deceased held by service of five Knights for 40 days in the Wars of Wales ; but then, this service was chargeable on the Baronies of Clun and Oswestry conjunctively. As to Scutages and Aids, charged on the Barony of Oswestry, as distinct from that of Clun, they not only varied at different times with one another, but bore no ascertainable ratio to the Knight' s- Fees actually existent in the Barony. \u2014 To the three Scutages of King Richard (in 1194, 1195, and 1197), William fitz Alan was assessed at 27^ knights'-fees. Subsequent Rolls prove that he acknowledged only a liability for 13 fees, nor have I any evidence of his paying the arrears left due on the dif ference. To the Scutages of 1199, 1201, and 1202 he was assessed at 27-Jj fees, but in neither instance did he pay on more than 13 fees. To the Scutage of 1203 William fitz Alan was assessed on 10 fees ; to that of 1204 he was not assessed at all ; of the Scutages of 1205 and 1206 he had special acquittance."], [297, "263 BARONY OF OSWESTRY. An Exchequer Record (probably of the year 1210) enters William fitz Alan as Tenant -in-capite of 27\\ knights' -fees in Shropshire.71 A Record of the following year, when he was dead, represents him as having held 5| fees in Staffordshire and 7 fees in Shropshire, in capite.72 In June 1214, John Marescall, as Custos of his lands, was assessed to the Scutage of Poitou on 22^ fees of old and 8 fees of new feoffment. To the Scutage of 1218 John fitz Alan was assessed on the Shropshire Pipe-Roll at 22^ knights'-fees. Of the Scutage of 1221, and the two Scutages of 1224, he had special quittance. To the Scutage of 1229 he was assessed at 22-i knights'-fees, but sub sequently acquitted. His acquittance on 224- fees to the Scutages of 1230, 1231, and 1232 is duly recorded. In 1235 he was assessed, to the Aid in marriage of the King's Sister, as Tenant of 32 fees of old feoffment. He duly paid 32 merks and 2d. over by the hand of Ralph Clerk. This was only the first half-yearly instalment. The Record (evidently inaccurate) leaves it uncertain whether he paid more than 1^ merks for the other half-year.73 Three Feodaries drawn up in or about the year 1240 vary as to the number of fees existent in this Barony. The accounts I quote are of Shropshire fees only, and are exclusive of the Barony of Clun. The first list sums the said fees as 244/, but the actual amount of items given is 25 J- 4-. The second and third lists each amount to 28 \\ | fees :7* In 1245, the Aid in marriage of the King's daughter is assessed at 22^ fees on one Tenure of John fitz Alan (II.) , \u2014 the Barony of Oswestry being clearly intended. Of the Scutage of 1246 the same 22| fees were acquitted. In 1254, to the Aid for knighting Prince Edward, one of John Fitz Alan's assessments was on 22^ fees. Similarly one acquittance of the Scutage of Wales in 1260 was in respect of 22\u00a3 fees of John fitz Alan. The above recital of bare facts must suffice for the question of Scutages. It is impossible to suggest any principle which may be taken to have guided such changes as have been enumerated. It is vain to point out that between the years 1165 and 1260 the Seigneury over four Lacy fees and one fee at Kemberton was added to Fitz Alan's Barony. There were perhaps other changes of smaller import, but it is evident that no changes whatever, in the number of Knights owing service to this Barony, effected a ?3 Testa de Nevill, pp. 61, 60. ?4 Ibidem, pp. 44-5, 47-8, 49.

I have already quoted various documents relating to the Tithes of Upton Magna. We have heard on the one hand that in Ed ward the Confessor's time these Tithes belonged to the Church of St. Peter at Shrewsbury. On the other hand we have seen the same Tithes conveyed or ensured to the same Church or Abbey, by successive grants of Warin Vicecomes and Alan fitz Flaald, and by Confirmations of Earl Roger, Earl Hugh, King William II., King Henry I., Stephen, King Henry IL, and King Henry III. One at least of these Confirmations makes additional mention of the Tithes of Preston. The allusion is to Preston-upon- Severn, now known as Preston-Boats, which was parochially and manorially a member of Upton Magna, and was probably held in demesne by the early Sheriffs. As yet however we have no mention of Upton Church. But such a Church must have existed in Saxon times, for in the 12th century it had more than one of those dependent Chapels, which were attached to none but the original Mother-Churches of a dis trict. The earliest Episcopal Confirmations to Shrewsbury Abbey are those of Bishop Roger de Clinton (1129-1148). One of them confirms two-thirds of the tithes of the demesnes of Opton and Prestone in aid of the Monastic Buildings.75 Probably the re maining third was left to the endowment of the Parochial Church, the Advowson whereof belonged immemorially to the Abbey, while the Incumbents were charged with a pension to the Abbey; \u2014 a pension, which I take to have been not merely a token of subjec tion, but a composition in lieu of such tithes as the said Incum bents were allowed to retain. I have on a former occasion described the second Charter of Bishop Clinton to Shrewsbury Abbey.76 This explicitly confirms \" the Church of Uptona, together with its Chapels and its pension of 20s.\" Bishop Durdenf s Charter (also before described) is still more explicit. It confirms \" the Church of Opton with the tithes of the Vill, and with the Chapel of Widinton and the tithes of that vill, and with the tithes of Preston and with the Chapels pertaining to the aforesaid Church \" (of Opton) . We have other Episcopal and Archiepiscopal Confirmations, renewing or reciting one or 75 Salop Chartulary, No. 325. | \" Supra, Vol. II. pp. 331-2."], [299, "THE CHURCH. 265 other of the above, but with no material variation as to the facts of the case. I conclude this quotation of Charters with the Con firmation of Henry III. to Shrewsbury Abbey which passed in 1227. It first confirms the tithe of Upton and the Church of the same vill, with a virgate of land, as originally given by Warin Vice comes. It then redundantly confirms the tithe of Opeton as given by Alan Vicecomes. Upton Church, sufficiently impoverished by the withdrawal of the bulk of its tithes, was never sought to be appropriated by the Monks of Shrewsbury. The Taxation of 1291 registers it as in the Archdeaconry and Deanery of Salop, and as worth \u00a310. per annum, over and above the pension of \u00a31., which the Incumbent paid over to Shrewsbury Abbey.77 In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth improperly quoted the above Taxation as one of \u00a310. They reduced that sum to \u00a38., as the value of the Ninth now assessable on the Parish, because the Glebe, Small-tithes, and other profits, collectively worth \u00a32., went to form the reputed Taxation. Of the gross assessment of \u00a38., the Com missioners allocated 8s. on the Temporalities of Haughmond Abbey within the Parish.78 The Valor of 1534-5 gives the Rectory of Upton Magna, then held by Richard Strete, as worth \u00a312. per annum, a sum which was apparently undiminished by any payment of Procurations or Synodals.79 This immunity was perhaps only temporary ; for Rich ard Strete was himself Archdeacon of Salop at the time.80 The Pension of 20s., due to Shrewsbury Abbey from this Church, is returned among the assets of that Monastery, which was also in receipt of jiOs. per annum more, being the ferm of the tithes of the demesne lands of Upton Magna.&l It would appear then that those early grants which seem to convey the whole tithes of Upton and Preston to the Abbey had been inoperative, or else that the Abbey had relaxed its rights in a very unusual way.

The Chancellor of Oxford (appointed to decide the matter) settled that the Abbot should pay 8s. in lieu of tithe on his Fisheries, and should pay tithes of pannage from whomsoever received. The award, which bears date December 8, 1244, decides that in respect of the other items the Abbot's privileges protected him from tithes. Sir John le Enfaunt, Rector of Upton, died June 11, 1309, and on January 27, 1310, \u2014 Master John de Bruneshope, Subdeacon, was instituted at the presentation of the Abbot and Convent of Salop. On April 4, 1331, this Rector has license for a year's non-residence, and mean time to put the fruits of his benefice to ferm. On July 14 following, he exchanges Livings with \u2014 William de Langele, late Rector of Ryburgh, or Ribursh, Magna (Norwich Dioc). Sir Robert de Alston occurs as Rector here in 1373. A suit which he had with John de Smethcote, Abbot of Haughmond, about the tithes of Blakewalmore, was settled on Oct. 5 of that year. Alston was to have the said tithes for life. Master Roger Wyke, Rector in 1407-8, died in 1411-2, and on February 10, 1412, \u2014 Sir William Walleford, Chaplain, was instituted on presenta tion of the Abbot and Convent of Salop. He resigned in 1434. Before I proceed with an account of the several members of Upton, it may be proper to point out a few minor transactions which relate to Upton itself. William fitz Alan (I.) gave the Mill of Upton to Haghmon Abbey, and the Grant was included, as his, in the Confirmation of Pope Alexander III., dated in 1172. About the year 1200, William, son of William fitz Alan, in creased this grant. He gave the Mills of Upton, with their appur tenances, and also the Suit thereto of his Manor of Wroxeter, whenever the Mill of Wroxeter could not work. And if any inha bitant of Wroxeter or Uuton should be found grinding in any other Mills, when the aforesaid Mills could grind, such person should be in misericordid of the Grantor. The Abbot and his Millers resident at Upton Mills were to have right of common in all pastures, roads, and paths, which pertained to the Manor of Wroxeter and to Nor ton. The Grantor moreover covenanted that neither he nor his heirs would from henceforth build any Mill upon the bank of Time,"], [301, "267 UPTON MAGNA. in the territory of the Manor of Wroxeter.

Witnesses, \u2014 Helias de Say (of Stokesay I presume) and Reyner de la Lee.82 At a less certain period Warin, son of Talun del Hewe, gave the bosc, which extended between his house of Hewe and Upton Mill, and also a meadow in Upton, to Haughmond Abbey, reserving a rent of Is., and receiving half a merk and a mare on the instant. Witnesses, \u2014 William fitz Alan, John le Strange. Between the years 1292 and 1302, as I suppose, Richard, Earl of Arundel gave to the Canons of Haughmond a parcel of land (called a Biflet) near Upton Mill. He gave it in exchange for the site of a certain Wind-Mill on the Canons' estate, at Piperinges in Sussex. Witness, \u2014 John de Arundele, the Grantor's Brother.83 This Earl Richard was, it seems, buried at Haughmond, for on March 1, 1326, Walter de Hibernia, being at Clun, bound himself to Edmund, Earl of Arundel, to find and maintain six wax candles of six pounds weight (each) about the place or tomb of the said Earl Edmund, wherever in the said Abbey he might happen to be buried ; \u2014 to be renewed yearly at the feast of Easter, so that the said candles might burn in the vigils and masses in which the candles about the tomb of Richard, Earl of Arundel, father of the said Ed mund, were accustomed to be burned ; \u2014 and the said Walter de Hibernia charged his lands of Upton near Haghmon and elsewhere, to provide the said candles. Witnesses, \u2014 Sir William de Ercalive, Sir John de Lee, and Sir John de Chetewinde, Knights.84 I have said that this Earl Edmund perished on the Scaffold, but whether at Bristol in October, or at Hereford in November of this very year, 1326, I will not here inquire. It is improbable that his wish to be buried at Haughmond was fulfilled, and to that I attribute the changed arrangements which are implied by the following Deed. \u2014 82 It does not appear why this docu ment was inserted in the Haughmond Chartulary, but we shall see that Gilbert the Forester was probably Ancestor of some who gave Benefactions elsewhere to the Abbey. younger son. 84 This interesting document is given in the Collectanea Topographica et Genealo gica, Vol. I. p. 367. The date there as signed, viz. 19 Edw. I., is at variance with possibility and with fact. It stands as 19 Edw. II. in the original Chartulary. I have already (Vol. II. p. 324, note 231) observed on the nature and frequency of simdar mistakes. 83 This shows that John fitz Alan de Arundel, whom I have supposed (Vol. IV. p. 17) to have been a kinsman and grantee of John fitz Alan (III.), was in fact his"], [302, "268 UPTON MAGNA. On Sunday, September 23, 1341, it was agreed between the Monastery of Haghmon and John, son of Walter de Hibernia of Upton, as follows.\u2014 The Canons were to find twelve wax candles, to burn in the Church of Haghmon, about the tomb of the Lord Richard, Earl of Arundel, and Alice his Countess,85 to be renewed yearly, so that, after such renovation, they should be of the weight of six pounds each ; and be burned at High Mass in the feasts of the Nativity, St. John the Evangelist, Epiphany, Purification of the Virgin, Annunciation of the Virgin, Easter, Pentecost, Nativity of John the Baptist, Assumption of the Virgin, Nativity of the Vir gin, Exaltation of the Holy Cross, All Saints, All Souls, and St. Michael, and on the anniversaries of the said Earl Richard and Countess Alice. And the said John de Hibernia, for the mainte nance of this right, assigned all his lands, to pay yearly to the Sacrist of Haghmon the sum of 10s. ; \u2014 and charged his lands at Upton therewith. Witness,\u2014 Sir AVilliam de Ercalwe.86 PRESTON UPON SEVERN, now PRESTON BOATS. This member of the Manor and Parish of Upton Magna was held, partly at least, in demesne by Warin Vicecomes and his Successors. There was a Weir or Fishery here from a very remote period, and which to this day occupies and commands the principal Channel of the Severn by the prescription of more than seven centpries. The said Weir or Fishery being in the demesne of the first Wil liam fitz Alan, was granted by him about the year 1135 to the sup port of Fulk, Prior of Haghmon, and his Brethren. The Charter which conveyed it is a document so relevant to the early history of the Monastery of Haghmon that I shall recur to it again. Before this I imagine that the general estate of Preston had been added to the feoffment of one of Fitz Alan's chief Vassals.\u2014 At Domesday the Manors of Acton-Reynald and Stanton-Hine heath had been held under Rainald Vicecomes by one Ricardus. It is very possible that this Ricardus was Ancestor of a family which subsequently took a name (De Stanton) from one of the said Manors. But before the death of Henry I. (1135) great additions were made to the feoffment of Ricardus, his heirs, or his successors. These ad ditions seem to have been as follows, viz. Preston Boats, Hunking ton, and Rea (members of Upton-Magna), and Roden and Roden- hurst (members of Rodington). 85 The Italian Lady already described as Alizon, daughter of the Marquess of Saluce (vide supra, p. 261). 86 Haughmond Chartulary, so. 219, b."], [303, "269 PRESTON BOATS. Seven estates went therefore to constitute that tenure under Fitz Alan, which was subsequently known as the \" Fee of Stanton.\" In 1165 the service due to Fitz Alan on this Fee was that of one Knight aud two Muntators, \u2014 the whole equivalent to the service of two Knights. At the same period the person who is entered in the Liber Niger as Robertus filius Halufi-i87 was undoubtedly the imme diate Tenant of the Fee of Stanton, and the ancestor of that family of Stanton which flourished for a century afterwards in the position of his heirs. Very little shall I say here of these Stantons. In 1231 William de Stanton was head of his house, but before 1240 he had been suc ceeded by his son Stephen. This Stephen is duly registered in the Feodaries of 1240, as holding two knights'-fees under John fitz Alan.88 He seems to have had an Undertenant at Preston, one Roger de Stanton, and Roger de Stanton again had for his Undertenant one Richard de Preston, a Clerk. Richard de Preston, Clerk, was a person much concerned in the affairs of Shrewsbury Abbey. He was in fact the Abbot's Clerk, for the Liberty or local Court of the Abbey Foregate, and at one time he appears to have held the higher office of Provost of the Foregate. This Richard de Preston, Clerk, about 1240-1250, gave to Haugh mon Abbey an acre of land in the field of Preston, whence the Canons might take and draw marl for the improvement of their land at Uffington. Witnesses, \u2014 Sir John, then official of Shrewsbury ; Sir Thomas de Roshall ; Master Alan Corbet ; and Thomas, Chaplain of Roshall. Roger de Stanton, holding over Richard de Preston, as I suppose, confirmed and quit-claimed the above grant. Witnesses, \u2014Stephen de Stanton and Sir William Chaplain of Uffington. The first of these witnesses, styling himself \" Stephen, son of William de Stantone,\" and probably as Lord of the Fee, also con firmed the grant, for half a merk paid him by the Canons. Wit ness,\u2014 Sir William de Hedleg. Subsequently to this, as I suppose, there was an agreement be tween the Abbot of Haughmon and Stephen de Stanton, whereby Stephen gave and confirmed part of an adjoining acre in Preston, where the Canons were to take marl as long as they pleased ; and afterwards to restore the land to Stephen. Witnesses, \u2014 Sir William de Hedle\u00b0*, Hugh Parson of Stanton, and John de Hodnet. About this time William de Doniton (another Undertenant in 87 Liber Niger, I. 143. I \" Testa de Nevill, pp. 44, 47, 49."], [304, "270 UPTON MAGNA. Preston) gave to the same Abbey part of an acre which he had bought of William fitz Ivo. The land in question joined up to the River Severn, near to the Weir or Fishery of the Canons, and it was given to enable them to make a road. Witnesses, \u2014 Nicholas fitz Hamo, Bailiff of the Foregate, and Richard de Preston, Clerk. The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 describes this Vill as \" Pres ton juxta le Goord.\" It was half a hide and held by Stephen de Stanton (son of the last Stephen), who, being a Minor, was in ward to Thomas de Lee, by gift of John fitz Alan, his Suzerain.89 Preston was at this time reputed to be a distinct Manor, and paid 2d. for Stretivard, and 2d. for Motfee, \u2014 the sums proportionable to any Manor of half a hide in Bradford Hundred. The eventual heir of this second Stephen de Stanton was his daughter Petronilla. As her husband, or as her Guardian, or in some way not as yet ascertained by me, John de Erkalewe appears in 1284 as seized of the Fee of Stanton. The Record states that John de Erkalewe holds the Vills of Preston, Stanton, Roden, and Rodenhurst, under Richard fitz Alan, for two knights'-fees. A Feodary of Bradford Hundred, drawn up perhaps three years later, has exactly the same statement. It is however certain that Petronilla, Lady of Stanton, eventually married to Thomas de Lee and transmitted her estates to her descendants by him. This Thomas de Lee was, I believe, next brother of John de Lee of Hadnall, The Lee, Alderton, and Hunkington, of whom and of whose wife, Alice Botterel, I have said something under Berrington. Thomas, by his marriage with Petronilla de Stanton, became a much more important personage than his elder brother. This mar riage took place before June 1289, and the issue thereof was at least four sons, viz. John, Oliver, Thomas, and Stephen. In 4 Edward II. (1310-11) Thomas, de Lee and Petronilla his wife gave to John, their eldest son and heir, the whole Manor of Stanton-super-Hyneheth, and the whole Manor of Preston-juxta-le- Were.90 The Deed, thus abridged, may have been part of some settlement or trust ; at all events it seems to have been ultimately inoperative, for it is clear that the same Petronilla (probably when a Widow, and so between the years 1316 and 1326) settled the Manor of Preston on-the-Were-juxta-Downton on Oliver her son, and the heirs of his body, with remainder to her son Stephen, and the heirs of his body, 89 Rot. Hundred. II. 57. | M Harleian MS. 1396, so. 253."], [305, "271 REA with remainder to her son Thomas, and the heirs of his body, with remainder to her own right heirs. It further appears that two of the said sons (Oliver and Thomas) died without issue, but that Stephen had a daughter, Catherine, who married Richard de Dreytou. The said Richard and Catherine being seized of the Manor of Preston, in or before the year 1384, were ousted by Robert Lee of Roden, who claimed the Manor on the grounds that Catherine was illegitimate, that her father Stephen, as well as her Uncles Oliver and Thomas, had died without lawful issue, and that he, Robert, was heir to Preston under the last re mainder of Petronilla's settlement, \u2014 that he was in fact her great grandson, being son of John, son of John, her eldest son before mentioned. In March 1384 Richard de Dreyton and his wife Ca therine sued Robert Lee of Roden for thus disseizing them. His only plea was Catherine's illegitimacy ; this in March 1385 was found to be a false plea, and she and her husband recovered seizin accordingly.91 When therefore the Feodary of 21 Richard II. (1397-8) enters Robert Lee as holding Staunton by service of two knights'-fees under Fitz Alan,93 the statement implies at most a mesne tenure in Preston. Of Undertenants in this vill I can only name Roger de Preston and Roger fitz Henry, both of Preston super Sabrinam, who were amerced by the Justices of the Forest in 1262. REA. This member of Upton Magna lies on the River Tern. I have before noticed that the word Rea means simply River.93 Accordingly we find that the vill under notice was described in Latin documents of the twelfth century as Aqua. I think that about the year 1155 Robert fitz Halufri held Rea as well as Preston under Fitz Alan, but that he had an undertenant at Rea, viz. one Roger fitz Hunald. Further, it appears from a literal construction of two documents that Robert fitz Halufri and Roger fitz Hunald were brothers ; \u2014 uterine brothers I presume, for the patronymics Fitz Halufri and Fitz Hunald, being distinct, we con clude that the two brethren were not sons of the same Father. However it is just possible that some Hunald was the father of both Robert and Roger, and that Fitz Halufri was a generic rather than 91 Placita apud Salop, 8 Ric. II. I 92 Inquisitions, 21 Rich. II. See printed I Calendar, Vol. III. page 323. 93 Supra, Vol. IV. p. 230."], [306, "272 UPTON MAGNA. a patronymic appellation. Thus the names of Fitz Alan, Fitz Odo, and Fitz Aer, were common to many successive generations of the same family. In short, Robert fitz Halufri may have been so called from his grandfather, while his Father's name may have been Hunald. Between the years 1155 and 1160 William fitz Alan certifies that Roger fitz Hunald had given all his land of Aqua to Haghmon Abbey, in almoign, and quit of all services, he (Fitz Alan) being pre sent and consenting thereto. The testing clause of this Charter runs as follows. \u2014 Teste R. filio Halufri fratre suo et concedente cum R. fratre suo et Johanne le Strange.9* This testing clause is partly explained by the Confirmation of Pope Alexander III. to Haghmon Abbey, dated in 1172. It con firms, \u2014 ex dono Rogeri Hunaldi terram de L' ewe, assensu Willielmi filii Alani domini sui et Roberti filii Halwredi fratris sui et here dum suorum. So then at this period (1155-1160) there were three brethren, Robert fitz Halufri, Roger fitz Hunald, and R. (perhaps Richard or Ralph). I have assumed Robert to have been the eldest, not merely from the evidence of the above Deed, but because under various names he appears attesting Charters of this period. For instance, in a Charter, which I shall quote presently under Down ton, he is called Robertus filius Hellunrici; in a Charter already quoted under Eton Mascott he is written as Robertus filius Cha leurici (probably a mistake for Haleurici) ; lastly, as Robertus filius Aluredi he has been seen to attest in 1160 the grant which Wil liam fitz Alan made cum corpore suo to Shrewsbury Abbey. Robert fitz Halufri was, as we have seen under Preston, living in 1165, and then holding an equivalent of two knights'-fees iu the Barony of William fitz Alan, deceased. I have not a doubt that the son and successor of Robert fitz Halufri was that Stephen fitz Aluric who appears on the Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 1177 as amerced one merk by Henry II. for trespass on the King's Forest. If so, my former suggestion, that Fitz Halufri, or Fitz Aluric, was a ge neric rather than a patronymic name, is somewhat strengthened. Stephen fitz Aluric seems to me to have abandoned this generic name, and to have styled himself De Stanton from his principal Manor of Stanton Hyneheath. As Stephen de Stanton we have surely seen him attesting Bishop Novant's Charter to Buildwas on November 22, 1192. Again, in 1199, I find Stephen de Stan- 91 Haughmond Chartulary, so. 171."], [307, "273 HUNKINGTON. ton giving 20s. to Hugh de Nevill, Justice of the Forest, \"for license to fence his haye, which stood within the King's Forest, and his own moor which was without the Forest.\"95 I will not here follow the further descent of these Stantons, seeing that their ancestor's grant to Haghmon dissolved their con nection with Rea. The Haughmond Chartulary cites another grant about Rea, com pletive, I presume, of Roger Hunald's. Thereby \" William fitz Alan (the second I think) gives to the Abbey the land of Aqua, to wit, of Ree, in moors and wastes, together with Aqua itself and all its appurtenances.\" The Feodary of 1287 gives Magna Ree and Parva Ree as mem bers of Richard fitz Alan's Manor of Upton. It then states, of Parva Ree alone, that it was held under the said Richard in frank almoign by the Abbot of Haghmon. The inference is, that Magna Ree, which I have no means of distinguishing from Parva Ree, remained in Fitz Alan's demesne. The Taxation of 1291 reckons among the Temporalities of Hagh mon Abbey a Mill at Upton, worth 10s. yearly ; a meadow at The Ree, worth 2s. ; and 5s. of assized rents receivable from The Ree.96 In 1340, the Abbot of Haghmon concedes to John son of John de Lye two parcels of land in Ree. On June 3, 1390, King Richard II. commissions Robert de Cherleton and John Hill to try a suit of novel disseizin which Ralph Abbot of Haghmon had arraigned against Henry de Ree concerning a tenement in Ree-juxta- Upton subtus-Haghmon. HUNKINGTON. Fitz Alan's Tenants in this member of Upton were the Lees, originally of Lea near Pimhill. Their feoffments there or elsewhere were of later date than the Liber Niger. In fact the first men tion which I find of any member of this family is of Reyner de Lee, who towards the close of the twelfth century acquired Alder ton near Middle, by purchase from Fulk fitz Warin, who held it under Fitz Alan, and whose posterity continued to be Mesne- Lords thereof.97 95 Rot. Pipe, 1 John. Salop. or inaccurate. He was iu nowise related to the Lees of Hughley ; far less was he any descendant of Rainald Vicecomes. His purchase of Alderton is dated, by Mr. Blakeway, much too early. 96 Pope Nich. Taxation, p. 260. 97 Almost everything printed in Mr. Blakeway's Sheriffs as to the descent or connections of Reyner de Lee is unfounded 35 VII."], [308, "274 UPTON MAGNA. Reyner de Lee was a person much conversant in the affairs of the second William fitz Alan, at the close of the 12th and the be ginning of the 13th centuries. His numerous attestations of that Baron's Charters, more especially those which related to Upton and its neighbourhood, are an illustration of this. Moreover, Reyner de Lee was Fitz Alan's deputy, as Sheriff of Shropshire, in the year 1201, when Fitz Alan quitted office. At the Iter of 1203 he appears as a Knight and Juror in cases of Grand Assize. I think that this Reyner de Lee, besides his estates at Lea juxta Pimhill, Alderton, and Hunkington, held something under Fitz Alan at Weston near Clun ; for \" Reiner de Lee, with consent of Thomas his son and heir, and for the souls' health of himself and Hawise his wife, gave to Haghmon Abbey 2s. rent which David de Weston held, William Chaplain of Clun attesting the grant.\" Again, \" Thomas de Lee confirmed the said grant of Reiner his father, and appointed that the said David de Weston and his suc cessors should pay the said rent of 2s. to the Abbey. Witnesses, \u2014 William Banastre, Alan Burcton, and Reiner his son.\" About 1220-30 we have seen Thomas son of Reiner de Lee at testing a Buildwas Charter,98 but I cannot connect him with the persons or places named therein. In 1221 and 1255 we have seen that Thomas de la Lee was a Coparcener in Aldon,99 showing, I think, that he or one of his ancestors had married a coheiress. His wardship of young Stephen de Stanton in 1255 was probably the result of a speculative purchase. His son John, marrying Petronilla de Draiton, acquired estates at Chatwall and Berrington.1 Him the Feodary of 1287 directly associates with Hunkington, saying that Honkynton was a member of Upton, and that John de Lee held it under Richard fitz Alan. I presume that Hunkington descended, with the other estates of this line, to John de Lee, the husband of Alice Botterel, which John I take to have been elder son and successor of John de Lee, hus band of Petronilla de Draiton ; but, as I have stated under Berring ton, the question is doubtful.3 This elder line of the Lees seems to have fallen into obscurity, nor do I find any further notices of Hunkington, to show what became of their interest here in the fourteenth century. Of Undertenants here I can name but one, viz. Walter de Hunkiton, a Juror in a cause concerning Albright-lee in 1272. 98 Supra, Vol. II. p. 218, note 66.

This member of Upton constituted a part of that new feoffment which between the years 1135 and 1160 was conferred on Marscot by the first William fitz Alan. Of Marscot I have spoken under Eaton Mascott. It remains then that I set forth the Deeds by which his grant of land at Downton to Haughmond Abbey was secured. \u2014 Between the years 1155 and 1160 William fitz Alan (I.) certifies that he has given, for the souls of himself and his ancestors, to Haghmon, the whole land which Marescote held in Dounton in his demesne. He has given it free of all earthly customs and aids, of all labour-dues (opei-acionibus) , scutages, tallages, arrays (exercitibus) , danegelds, hidages, and hidegelds.

So then Marscote gave the land, Fitz Alan released his seigneural rights and expedited a Charter conveying the land with its im munities, while Isabel de Sai, his newly married wife, waived her right of dower in return for certain articles of domestic use or orna ment. Between the years 1165 and 1170 Geoffrey de Ver and Isabel de Say his wife, confirm to the Abbey all the land which Marescott held in Dounton in demesne, as William fitz Alan had given it. Witnesses, \u2014 Richard de Cam vill, William de Caineto, William fitz Adeline, William fitz Hervey, and Osbert his brother, Gilbert de Ver, William de Ver, Ralph de Ver. This Charter shows how important a person Isabel de Say's second husband was. It passed, I doubt not, in the Court of Henry IL, for the five first witnesses were either officers of that King's Household, or attendants, more or less frequent, on his person. Pope Alexander III., confirming the endowments of Haghmon in 1172, enumerates these, viz. Ex dono Willielmi filii Alani fundatoris predicts ecclesi\u00e6, dominium de Dontona et dimidiam virgatam in eadem villa ; piscariam super Sabrinam cum dimidid virgatd terr\u0153 ; molendinum de Uptona cum dimidia virgatd terr\u0153 et insulis qu\u00e6 ad Mud pertinent. This shows that Fitz Alan's respective grants"], [310, "276 UPTON MAGNA. in Downton, Preston, and Upton were somewhat fuller than the extant Vouchers would imply. The Confirmation of William fitz Alan (II.) extends to other things besides Downton. It probably passed about the year 1190. I will give it in the original Latin. \u2014 Omnibus Sancte Ecclesie filiis Willielmus filius Alani salutem.

The result is embodied in a Charter of the Earl dated at Haghmon on February 2, 1294, and attested by Sir William de Huggeford, and John de Sibbeton, knights ; Thomas de la Hyde, the Earl's Seneschal ; Philip de Guldeford ; and Roger de Kynlet. Estovers in the Earl's Woods are further guaranteed by this Charter, and facilities for repairing the Mills of the Canons. A Charter of Edmund, Earl of Arundel, confirms that of Earl Richard, incidentally tracing part of the parochial boundaries be tween Downton and Uffington, between Upton Magna and St. Alk mund's, Shrewsbury, and between Upton Magna and the Demesne of Haughmond Abbey, which I presume was then recognized as extra parochial. The same Earl Edmund granted Estovers in his Wood of Upton to the Canons and their men of Dounton. This Charter bears date at London on June 29, 1326, that is within a few months of the Earl's ruin and death. On April 19, 1339, a Jury of the Manorial Court of Upton found that the Abbots of Haghmon had customarily taken timber from the Lord's Woods to repair their Mill of Upton, and that the Abbot's Tenants at Downton had customarily taken firewood from the same boses like other tenants in the Manor, but the antiquity and warranty of these customs the Jury knew not. Some other Charters relate to the acquisitions of the Abbey at Downton, and mention incidentally the names of some of Fitz Alan's Tenants in this quarter. \u2014 About the year 1220, Roger Chusin gave to the Canons a virgate to a Charter of the first WiUiam Fitz Alan.

How Osbert fitz Roger, or fitz Froger, could be Alan fitz Oliver's expectant heir, when the latter had brothers, it is difficult to say.

Sir Herbert for 10 merks quit-claimed all that part of the assarts of Sundorn in the Bosc of Haghmon which belonged to the Manor of Upton, and which was disputed between him and the Abbot. The Abbot was to pay Id. per annum to Her bert and his heirs, and to make no further assarts in that wood, except with Herbert's consent.

The Nemus of Asteley, and the Vivary of Pimbeleg, are named in defining the boundaries of this concession, which was attested by William de Pimbeleg, Philip de Peninton, Thomas de Withinton, and William de Rodene. A Confirmation of this Quit claim, bv Alan son of Herbert Mauveisin, is attested by the same witnesses, and must have passed between 1240 and 1242. Between the years 1255 and 1260 (as I suppose) John fitz Alan and Seer de Berewike (as Saer Mauveysin is here called) give two several quit-claims to the Abbey, in respect of a certain foss made by the Canons, and which is described as extending from Stan weiesdor towards Ydeburiate.

These Estovers, it seems, had been matter of litigation before Sir E. de Torkeby and others, Justices itinerant in Shropshire.9 I have quoted, under Golding, a Deed, perhaps fifty years earlier than the last, which shows that another of Fitz Alan's Vassals, viz. Hugh de Beckbury, had certain assarts at Sundorn which he made over to Haghmon Abbey.10 The acquisition thereof by Hugh de Beckbury was probably under some Fine or grant of a Fitz Alan, rather than by inheritance. The great Baronies of that period had been so parcelled out by feoffments, that when the Suzerain wanted to raise money, or to reward a Servant, he was obliged to have re course to the Manors of his Demesne, for that purpose. In 1250, five acres and eight perches of Forest-land in Sundr' were allotted to the Abbot of Haghemon at an arrentation of 3s. 9d. Again, at the Forest Assizes of 1262, the Abbot exhibited to the Justices a Royal Charter, which was allowed as a warrant for his having long before (de veteri) assarted 17 acres in Sondre. The Taxation of 1291 includes two carucates of land in Sondene, worth \u00a3\\.per annum, among the temporalities of Haghmon Abbey.11 On June 11, 1461, the Abbot of Haghmon, demises his Grange of Sondron to William Higges for 30 years, for a sum of \u00a37. 3s. 4</., and reserving Suit of Court and a Heriot. Parochially the status of Sundorn is curious. It was originally in the Shrewsbury Parish of St. Alkmund's, and so, when (in 1155-7) the Canons of Haughmond got the estate, they made a composition with the Abbot of Lilleshall about the tithes of Sundorn. Their agreement, though not extant, was confirmed by Pope Alexander III. in 1172. The result is clear, viz. that Sundorn was thus detached from St. Alkmund's Parish and annexed to the extra-parochial liberty of Haghmon. It remains extra-parochial to this day. HAUGHTON.

This distinction has its reflex in the pre sent day ; \u2014 for part of Haughton is in the Parish of High Ercall, and part in the Parish of Upton Magna. It is of Haughton, only so far as it was a member of Upton, that I am now to speak. I cannot tell who held this part of Haughton under Fitz Alan in 1165, but in 1240 Reyner de Acton is said to hold half a knight's fee in Halekton (Haughton) and Grinsill, of that Barony.13 The Bradford Hundred- Roll of 1255 puts all Halihton down as 1^ hides. One moiety thereof was held by Thomas Boterel as Guardian of P., son of Reginald (i. e. Reyner) de Acton. It was held of the Fee of John fitz Alan and did ward at Oswestry for 40 days by one horse man ;13 a service equivalent to half a knight's-fee, and probably due on Haughton and Grinsill collectively. How Sir Richard de Leighton (who succeeded to his paternal in heritance in 1262) acquired the Acton Fee in Haughton I cannot say. About 1270-80, as \" Richard, Lord of Leighton, knight,\" he gives in aid of the Sacristy of Haghmon Abbey 4 acres and 1 seilion of land in Halghtou, whereon the Canons might build a house. Witnesses, \u2014 John de Ercalwe, John fitz Aer, knights; and Robert de Peninton.14 The Feodaries of 1284 and 1287 both enter Richard de Leighton as holding half Haughton under Richard fitz Alan. Subsequently Richard de Leyghton enfeoffed Robert Corbet of Moreton and his wife Matilda, conjointly, in certain tenements in Halughton. Leyghton ultimately retained no mesne interest in this feoffment, for the In quest, taken on Robert Corbet's tenures in 1301, states that he and his wife had held the premises under Philip Burnel's heirs, by a penny rent.15 I suppose that Burnel's Seigneury came with his wife Matilda fitz Alan, but possibly it was purchased from Leygh ton, and was a mesne interest only. Between 1304 and 1310, Edmund Earl of Arundel gives to Hao-hmon Abbey four shillings rent, receivable from his Tenants in Haghton, in exchange for seven burgages at Ruyton (near Bas- 12 Testa de Nevill, pp. 44, 47, 49.

By Patent of May 26, 1318, the King allows Henry and Richard Beaufrere, each to convey a messuage and virgate in Halghton juxta Haghmon to the Abbey of Haghmon, \u2014 to be held by the Abbey of the Lords of the Fee. On July 3, 1319, Henry and Richard, sons of Roger Beaufrere, make such conveyances ; John de Lee, Geof frey de Peninton with his brothers John and Philip, John de Withi ford, William Reginald of Withiford, and Master Robert de Preston, attesting their Deeds. I cannot say that these two virgates were part of the Fitz-Alan Fee in Haughton, but it seems probable that the Abbey gradually acquired a greater part of both moieties of the Manor. On March 24, 1336, King Edward III. empowers Robert Corbet of Moreton to convey to Haghmon Abbey 9 messuages and 5 virgates in Haughton and Egebaldenham (Edgebold) in exchange for 16 messuages, a Mill, a Vivary, and 10^ virgates in Stokyate, Kenewike, Brome, and Newton (all near Ellesmere). In the same year it seems that certain tenements in Haughton held by John le Strange of Ercall, deceased, escheated to Haugh mond Abbey, because the said John was illegitimate, and died with out heirs. On July 18, 1336, Robert Corbet of Morton, being then at Wattlesborough, instructs John Horde, his Valet, to give the Abbot seizin of these escheats, which the Abbot claimed against Corbet.16 From this I judge that Le Strange had previously held the said tenements under Corbet, and that they were part of the recent exchange between Corbet and the Abbey. In 21 Richard II. (1397-8) the Abbot of Haughmond and John Mouthe are said to hold half a fee in Halghton and Grinsill under the Barony of Fitz Alan.17 Whatever John Mouthe may have had in Haughton, it will have descended to him from Corbet of Moreton. i^auafjmottti gfctop.

Haughmond-Hill, with the wood-land and waste to its north, remained unvisited save by the Traveller, the Hunter, or the Forester ; \u2014 untenanted, save by the Robber, or the Hermit. As to the time and mode of the Foundation of Haughmond Abbey, we have a variety of statements, which, as being discordant with each other, must involve some degree of error. To detect that error shall be our first concern. The first statement which I shall cite upon the matter is em bodied in the Abbey-Chartulary.1 It has been printed in the ' Mo nasticon,'3 but with much verbal and grammatical incorrectness. This is not chargeable on the original, which runs as follows. \u2014 Fundata est Abbathia de Haghmon anno Domini millesimo cen tesimo, et in anno ultimo regni Regis Willielmi Rufi, et anno regni Regis Henrici primi primo, per Willielmum filium Alani, ut patet in pluribus, et specialiter in duobus Bullis sub plumbo Alexandri Pap\u0153 Tercii vocantis eum Fundatorem predicti loci? This document then asserts Haughmond Abbey to have been founded in 1100, and William Fitz- Alan to have been its Founder. It alludes to much unspecified evidence of the fact, or facts (for it is ambiguously worded), and particularly cites two Bulls of Pope Alexander III. in support thereof. Now we happen to know some thing of Pope Alexander's two Bulls to Haughmond. One, dated apparently in 1172, is of \"Privileges.\" It is preserved in the Chartulary4 in all its essential parts, and says not a word about the Founder or date of foundation, nor indeed is it a document of the class which would be likely to contain such allusions. The other Bull also exists in the shape of a full and apparently accurate transcript.5 It is dated at Tusculanum, May 14, 1172. All Deeds quoted in the following pages, and of which the particular authority is not given in the notes, are from one or other of these Chartularies. 1 Chartulary of Haughmond Abbey (in possession of D. R. Corbet of Sundorn, Esq.), so. 76.

It is a confirmation of \"grants\" to the Abbey. It distinctly in dicates William Fitz-Alan as the Founder thereof, but says nothing about the date of foundation. In short, a matter so irrelevant and discursive can hardly be conceived to have crept into a Papal Bull of any kind. We therefore have no other authority for dating the foundation of Haughmond in 1100, than the assertion of that Abbot or Canon of the House who wrote the above extract at least 72 years after the events he affects to describe (otherwise he could not quote the Bulls of 1172) .6 Any one acquainted with those monastic documents, usually en titled De Fundatione or Historia Fundalionis, will know that they are not to be received without caution. The antiquity of a house was a matter of pride as well as of advantage. It was therefore seldom underrated by any member of the house concerned. We have external evidence which is very strong against this alleged date of foundation. William Fitz-Alan, the undoubted Founder, was, as we have seen, called a youth by Ordericus in 1138, and was therefore not born so early as 1100. Also, no Ca nons-regular of St. Augustine, such as were those of Haughmond, had found their way into England, till 1105 at the earliest.7 A second date has been assigned for this foundation under the following circumstances. \u2014 In the year 1253 a Shropshire jury had been empanelled to try an issue as to the right of patronage over this House. Their return, made to the Courts at Westminster, in Michaelmas Term of that year, remains on the Plea-Rolls, and a seeming copy thereof is given in the Abbey Chartulary. The latter however enlarges on the text of the Plea-Roll. Part of the verdict as recorded in the legal document is, Dicta Abbacia est de feodo Johannis filii Alani et a, predecessoribus suis fundata ;\u25a0 \u2014 to which words the Chartulary adds, \" anno xxxvii Regis Henrici Se cundi.\"8 Henry II. did not, however, live to enter on his 37th, or even on his 36th regnal year. This inaccuracy is not, I imagine, to be explained by charging it on a false chronology of the jurors, * The extract is written in red ink throughout, and is therefore the work of the Rubrieator of the Chartulary. All documents professing to be copied from original deeds stand in black ink. The Chartulary was probably written as late as the reign of Henry VII. ; but I have allowed in the text for a possibility that the writer got his information from some older source. 7 Their first houses seem to have been at Colchester, founded in 1105, \u2014 Christ Church, London, founded about 1108, \u2014 Brisett, in Suffolk, founded about 1110, \u2014 and Nostell, Yorkshire, founded about 1114.

It rather belongs to the transcriber of the Chartulary, who has assigned the year in which the trial was taken (viz. 37 Henry) to the foun dation of the Abbey, and so incorporated it in the supposed verdict, altering, however, the style of the King to suit his own ideas. The third date assigned for the foundation of Haughmond is 1110,' which may be possible, so far as that about that time Augus tine Canons were settling in England, but is inconsistent with the known era of the Founder. We may now dismiss all previous statements on this subject, and investigate the question of date on other evidence. \u2014 The mistakes whicli have given to Haughmond a too high degree of antiquity, may possibly be connected with a circumstance which Leland heard and recorded, viz. that there had been a Hermitage and Chapel there, previous to the erection of the Abbey.10 The Chartulary contains no Charter of Foundation by which we may estimate the date when the Abbey was begun. The document purporting to be a Foundation-Charter is in fact nothing of the kind, but, as I shall presently show, belongs to a much later period. The next object of search must therefore be the earliest deed which the Chartulary contains. This, when found, though it may say nothing about foundation, will probably belong to the period im mediately succeeding that event. The deed then which I fix upon hypothetically, as the oldest in the Chartulary, is one whereby William Fitz- Alan gives, to \" the Church of St. John the Evan gelist at Haghmon, the fishery of Upton, which is upon Severn, and the man and land pertaining thereto, free and quit of all ser vice, for the maintenance (victum) of Fulco the Prior, and all his brethren, living in the aforesaid church, in right perpetual, so long as faithful brethren shall serve God in the same church. Wit nesses, \u2014 Walter, his (the grantor's) brother, and Christiana, his (the grantor's) wife, and Matthew Dapifer.\"11 Now this Deed exhibits, I think, the church of Haughmond as a Priory, and so in an intermediate state between the previous Hermitage and the subsequent Abbey. As no other Charter to 9 Tanner assigns this date on the evi dence of a MS. chronicle, formerly in founder. He says too that William Fitz- Alan and his wife were buried at Haugh mond.

Haughmond has so obvious an appearance of being a grant to a Priory, we have thus far justified our selection of this as the ear liest of its Charters. \u2014 The difficulty of dating this Charter is not so great as its very brief testing-clause would promise. The Grantor was a \"youth,\"12 and became an exile from Shropshire in 1138. He is not heard of at any earlier period than the close of Henry I.'s, or beginning of Stephen's reign. To that period (1130-8) I therefore assign the deed. With this agrees all that can be ascertained of the two wit nesses; e.g. Walter Fitz-Alan had no feoffment in his brother's barony till after 1135. In 1141 he appears as an active partisan of the Empress. He died in 1177. Christiana, the wife of William Fitz-Alan, was a niece of the Earl of Gloucester. The latter was the eldest of Henry I.'s illegitimate children. It is not probable that he should have had a marriageable niece much before 1135. At the same time Fitz-Alan must have been married at least as early as 1136, for, in August 1138, he was father of more than one child by this very wife, of whom we are speaking. There is another very early grant by William Fitz-Alan to Haugh mond. It does not speak of the church either as a Priory or an Abbey, but I cannot help looking on this Charter as nearly coeval with the last. \" William Fitz-Alan with his wife, Dame Christiana, give to God and to the Church of St. John of Hamon, and to the Canons there serving God, two carucates of their own demesne (de proprio nostro fundo) of Hales \" (Sheriff Hales) : they give the same \" for support of the Canons' necessities, in perpetual alms, for the remission of the grantors' sins and the souls' redemption of their pa rents and ancestors, and specially for the soul of their son Alan, whose body they had bestowed in burial there \" (i. e. .at Haughmond) .13 The next Charter which I shall cite is one of which the date can 12 Ordericus calls him so, but the ex pression must be construed with some la titude. Fitz Alan was probably upwards of thirty years of age in 1138. The other witnesses are John le Strange and Marescote, whose feoffments in Shrop shire were later than 1135. Marescote, unless this deed be the exception, does not appear till after Fitz-Alan's restoration in 1155. John le Strange held indeed a fee in Norfolk under Fitz-Alan, which was apparently of old feoffment, i. e. grant ed to him or his ancestors before 1135. However, the early history of the Stranges is itself too great a problem to allow of its yielding any facts for the clearance of other difficulties. 13 Chartulary, so. 53.

Another grant of the Empress to Haughmond I can say little of. It was of Walcot Mill, and was attested by Robert fitz Heldeber, Walter Fitz-Alan, and Nigel de Brae. The infamy of the first wit ness happens to furnish us with the proximate date of this charter. It must have passed before 1144, when Robert Fitz-Hildebrand, having betrayed the interests of the Empress to Stephen and the Bishop of Winchester, and being tainted with the further crimes of adultery and sacrilege, expired by the same horrible death which is recorded as the judgment of Heaven on Herod Agrippa. There was a Charter of King Stephen to Haughmond, in which, addressing the Bishop of Chester, he gives three carucates and the mill of Walcote, as if his own original gift, and without any refer ence to the previous. Charters of the Empress.16 This was the usual course pursued by these great antagonists. .It is again to be noted in this Charter, that the grantees are described only as the \" Canons Regular of Haghmon.\" Another early grant to Haughmond is by Walcheline de Maminot, a noted partisan of the Empress, and who, early in Stephen's reign, succeeded, in what way is not known, to a 14 Chartulary, so. 220, collated with Harleian MS. 2188, sol. 123. have been on July 25.

This Charter is to the \" Church of St. John of Haghmon,\" to which it conveys the Mill of Bradeforde,17 then involved in the Manor of High Ercall. It is attested by Roger fitz Warin and Fulk, his brother, whom I believe to have been tenants of the Peverels at Whittington. This deed passed before the year 1147, as we know from the concurrent act of William Peverel of Dover, at that time a Coparcener in the Peverel estates. William Peverell's grant, the original of which still exists,18 is verbally to \" St. John and the Canons of Haiman.\" Its date, as well as the date of Walcheline Maminot's deed (to which it refers), is fixed as in or before 1147, for William Peverel went on the crusade of that year and perished therein. \" Henry, Duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, and Earl of Anjou,\" confirmed his mother's donation to Haughmond, according to her Charter. The Prince was at Leicester, and William Fitz-Alan at tests his Deed.19 It can be dated almost to a day, and so is not only a fact for history, but a monument of Fitz-Alan's constancy. The Prince attained the titles which he uses in 1151 and 1152. On January 6, 1153, he landed in England to fight for his crown. He was at Leicester on June 7, at Warwick on June 12, and, on August 18, he entered on that pacification with Stephen which at length ended in his leaving England about Easter 1154. In eight months he returned, not however as Duke of Normandy only, but as Stephen's successor on the throne. In 1155, the Haughmond Chartulary supplies us with another interesting circumstance and its date. In the beginning of July a great council of the nation had been summoned to Bridgnorth to settle the terms of the King's peace with Hugh de Mortimer, hitherto in rebellion. William Fitz-Alan, now no longer under attaint, had restitution of his lands and honours from the King. On the 25th of July, the day on which he took the homage of his tenants at Bridgnorth, and in presence of a great concourse of barons and knights, Fitz-Alan gave the church of Wroxeter to the Abbot and Canons of Hageman in perpetual alms, for the well-being of the Lord the King, and the souls'-health of himself, his ancestors, and successors.20 17 Chartulary, so. 39. 19 Chartulary, so. 220, b. 18 In possession of Mr. George Morris of Shrewsbury.

He gave them half a salt-pit in South Wich (Cheshire), a grant afterwards, it would seem, increased by his son, but again without reference to 'the previous gift of the father. He further encouraged and confirmed several grants of his tenants, viz. of Hamo le Strange in Naginton; of Gilbert de Hadnall iu Hard wick ; of Osbert de Hopton and others in Hopley ; of Alan Fitz Oliver and others in Sundorn, and of Roger Fitz Hunald in Ree.23 I have said that William Fitz- Alan died about Easter 1160. By his first wife, Christiana, he left no surviving male issue, but by his second wife, Isabel de Say, Baroness of Clun, whom he seems to have married about 1153-4, he left a son, William, an infant, whose minority seems to have expired about June, 1175.

Here, therefore, we have not only the first assurance of Haughmond having become an Abbey, but also a specific as sertion of its previously low condition. The grant by William Fitz-Alan, as preserved in the Chartulary, is a most curious document, and shall be given else where. I should state, however, that he gives Wroxeter Church to his Canons (Canonicis meis de Haghmon) \"to in crease their number, so that they may 21 Rot. Pip., 2 Hen. II. Salop. 22 Chartulary, passim : and Harl. MS. 2188, sol. 123. 37 VII."], [330, "290 UPTON MAGNA. this minority that King Henry II. , at request of Alured, Abbot of Haughmond, who seems to have sometime been the King's tutor,23 granted to William Fitz-Alan and his heirs, custody of the Abbey and its possessions in all future vacancies ; and this, notwithstanding any grants which had been or might be made, by the King or his heirs, to the said Abbey.24 This was in effect a cession of the right of patronage by the King to the youthful heir of the Founder of Haughmond. The Deed passed unquestionably either between 1163 and 1166, or else in 1170.25 The favour thus granted at petition of Abbot Alured, rather than of Fitz-Alan, is curiously consistent with the known minority of the latter. Another Charter remains on the Abbey-Register, which requires a few remarks here, inasmuch as its expressions are such as to render it easily mistaken for the Foundation Charter. It is entitled, \" De Sede et Loco Abbathi\u00e6 ibidem,\" and, in fact, conveys the site and precinct of the church, with all appurtenances, to the Canons.26 This is done without any reference to a previous grant thereof. The Charter is, however, by the second William Fitz-Alan, and so is really only a Charter of confirmation. I could quote several other Charters of the same Baron, which have a similarly delusive appear ance ; but avoiding a matter of such detail, I will merely say that this deed passed positively between the years 1175 and 1196, probably towards the close of that period. Summarily, then, we conclude the Augustine House of Haugh mond to have been founded as a Priory between 1130 and 1138, to have grown into an Abbey in or before 1155, and that its Founder in all respects was the first William fitz Alan ; that its other bene factors, during the life of the Founder, were the Empress Matilda, King Henry II. , Walcheline Maminot, William Peverel of Dover, and several of the Founder's tenants. We need not include Stephen, whose grant was either an act of usurpation, or a piece of mimic 23 Adpreces Aluredi Abbatis de Hagh mon, nutricii mei. was elected Bishop of Ely in 1173. A grant of land which the King made cotemporarily to Haughmond has the two witnesses rightly described (Chartulary, sol. 132). It also is dated at Woodstock, and it received the Papal Confirmation in May, 1172. These facts, when combined with the known movements of the King, limit the date of both deeds as stated in the text. 24 Monasticon, VI. 108, Num.

The foundation of Haughmond was therefore associated with a distinct political creed ; for those whom I have named were, for the most part, either the representatives or champions of that cause of legitimacy which was at issue during the twenty years that followed the death of Henry I. All, or nearly all, were sufferers, either from the eminence of their position, or the greater loftiness of their prin ciples. Thus out of calamities such as Shropshire has never again experienced, were elicited at least two beneficial results \u2014 the increase of its religious estabbshments, and the triumph of those hereditary rights which it has ever since venerated as divine. Thus far I have treated of the Foundation of Haughmond Abbey as distinct from its development. In proceeding with the latter subject the multiplicity of evidences obliges me to be select. I pro pose, then, to take in chronological order such documents as refer to the site, the precinct, the home-estate, or the internal affairs of the Monastery.

Privileges is in the form usually granted to Augustine Houses. As printed elsewhere,39 I need not minutely describe it. It exempts all lands brought under cultivation by the Canons (novalia), and all the produce applied to feeding their five stock, from tithes. It gives them the right oifree sepulture within the Abbey, and forbids any one to resist the last Wills of those who should have given themselves in burial there. Such were the pro visions which operated to make Sundorn and Haughmond extra parochial, a status which remains to this day. The same Bull gives the Canons the uncontrolled right of electing their successive Abbots; the right of celebrating divine services, in a prescribed way, even during the time of a General Interdict ; a freedom from tithes as regarded all their meadows and mills, unless previously tithed ; and it forbids any one to erect either Church or Oratory within Parishes, whereof the Canons had the Advowson, except with the consent of the Diocesan Bishop and of themselves. The same or other privileges were enlarged or conferred by suc cessive papal Bulls of Honorius III. (1216-1227), Nicholas III. (1277-1280), Martin IV. (1281-1285), and Boniface IX. (1389 1404). Richard Peche, Bishop of Coventry (1161-1182), com pleted the parochial independence of this House, by allowing that one of the Brethren, holding the office of Sacrist under the Abbot, should administer the Sacrament of Baptism to both Jews and Infants within the Monastery, and should have right parochial over all familiars or domestics of the House, as regarded the administra tion of Church Sacraments in general.30 The following Charters of King Henry II.,31 passed at Shrews bury, probably towards the close of the year 1176. \u2014 Henricus D.G.

Not a single Patent, Privilege, or favour can I find vouchsafed by King John to this House. Between 1198 and 1208, Geoffrey de Muschamp, Bishop of Coventry, confirmed that mansure of land in the Foregate of Chester, which the Canons had held in the time of his predecessors (the allusion is to Walter Durdent) . This Con firmation was attested by Master Robert, Archdeacon of Salop.33 The Charta de Forestd promulgated by King Henry III., on February 11, 1225, was conceived in a liberal spirit. It was fol lowed by a Perambulation of the Forests of Shropshire, a document now lost ; but full advantage seems to have been taken of the King's liberality. Among other lands, disforested by this perambulation, were lands in the Forest of Haghmon and in Mittelwode. The Canons took immediate opportunity to assart 16 acres in these lo calities. A Writ-Close of the King, dated January 10, 1227, shows that the King was greatly dissatisfied with the first Perambulation of Shropshire Forests, and wished to reinvestigate its particulars.34 We learn from the Haughmond Chartulary that a second Peram bulation shortly took place, and that the localities where the Canons had made their assarts were reafforested. But on August 10, 1232, the King being at Wenlock, the Canons of Haughmond obtained from him a special Charter, acquitting the aforesaid 16 acres from regard and view of the King's Foresters for ever. The Bishops of Winchester and of Coventry and Lichfield, the Earl of Chester and Lincoln, and John de Lacy, Constable of Chester, attested the King's Charter.35 On May 10, 1253, a Writ of King Henry III. directs that Inqui sition be made as to the Jus Fundatorium of Haghmon Abbey, that is, who had been used to have custody of the Abbey during vacan cies, and who had been used to grant the license for an Abbot, to be at any time elected, and to grant assent to such election when made? The Jury replied hereto that the Ancestors of John fitz Alan had been used to have custody of the Abbey on the death or cession of any Abbot, that from them license to elect a new Abbot 33 Chartulary, so. 42. 3< Rot.

This Verdict and John fitz Alan's seizin of the right of patronage were sanctioned by pro cess of the Courts of Westminster, in Michaelmas Term 1253, and by a Writ of the King himself, dated October 18 of the same year.36 On October 10, 1283, King Edward I., being at Acton Burnell, allows the Abbot and Convent of Haghmon to assart and fence 14 acres of land in their Bosc of Bottewode and 14 acres of meadow in their Bosc of Haghmon.37 By comparing a statement in the Chartulary of Haughmond38 with the Taxation of Pope Nicholas, we get an estimate of the ex tent and value of the Monastic possessions in 1291.

However the total presented, viz. \u00a3157. 4s. \\\\di, is within 40_\\ of the total, apparently produced by the Accountant who wrote the Chartulary. By the Great Forest-Perambulation of 1300, the Abbey of Hag wemon with its boses, roads, and plains, as well as the Earl of Arundel's bosc of Upton, were disforested. It appears from a letter of Bishop Walter de Langton, dated Janu ary 23rd, 1306, that in his late Visitations of this Abbey, he had been scandalized at finding that five professed Canons of the House were living loose and irregular lives. As they remained incorrigible, he now orders his Official, and the Archdeacon of Salop, to cause them to be severally deported to five other Augustine Monasteries of his Diocese, and there to be subjected to a discipline which he prescribes. John de Sarum, Peter de Sumerford, Richard de Peppe lawe, William de Leighton, and Thomas de Bruges, were the Canons thus dealt with.39 On August 31, 1310, Edmund Earl of Arundel, being at Haugh mon, gave leave to the Canons to improve, as they might, the waste and bosc which lay between the road, which led from the Abbey to wards Shawbury, and the wood of Uffington. On April 7, 1313, a Patent of Edward II. allows the Canons to enclose 60 acres of their bosc which lay within the Royal Forest of Haghmon.40 On May 1, 1313, Edmund Earl of Arundel, then at Castle-Isabel, quit-claims to the Abbey a disputed parcel of wood between the Abbey wood and Upton wood. He also grants & place of waste land to the Abbey, near Upton Mill. Witnesses, \u2014 Sir John Peschel, Sir John Blangmoster, knights ; Sir Roger de Kynlet, Clerk, Roger Cheney, and Roger Careles. On May 16, 1314, Edmund Earl of Arundel demises to the Ab bey, for a fee-farm rent of 2 merks, a parcel of land in the bosc of Haghmon, called Blakewellemor, lying, in length, between the Shrewsbury and Haughton road, and the road from the Abbey to wards Shawbury, aud in breadth between the field of Haghmon and the field of Haughton.

He made certain alterations in a plan for the support and treatment of Gilbert de Caumpedene, the late Abbot, which plan had been framed by a Commissioner of the Bishop's, pursuant to an order made at a previous visitation, when the said Abbot's resig nation had been tendered and accepted. By another letter, immediately after the Visitation of 1315, Bishop Langton rebukes the Convent for having granted a corrody for life to one Roger de Oi without Episcopal sanction ; also for al lowing each Canon a sum of money wherewith to provide clothing and shoes for himself. He forbids such practices in future, and di rects that a Chamberlain be appointed, who should provide gar ments, etc., for all members of the community indifferently. \" The Bishop will not on this occasion inflict punishment for the above excesses. \"42 On July 2, 1315, the same Bishop approves of the step which the Convent had taken in apportioning specific revenues, wherewith their Chamberlain was to provide the vesture of the Brethren. The fruits and profits of Cheswardine Church, and the rents of Nagynton and Hydesland, were thus appropriated.43 On August 12 (1316) Edmund Earl of Arundel, then at Arundel, advises Walter de Yrlond, Warden of his Wood of Upton, that he has granted a parcel thereof, in farm, to Haghmon Abbey. The Canons are to have seizin thereof. On Sept. 28, 1316, the Earl, being at Clun, gives a similar com mission to his dear and well-beloved Roger Carles, who, on October 12 following, certifies his fulfilment of the Earl's behest. On May 26, 1318, King Edward II. issues a Patent allowing Edmund Earl of Arundel to demise, at a fee-farm rent of 20s., to the Abbot and Convent of Haghmon, 60 acres of his boses in Up- ton Manor. On February 27, 1320, King Edward II. confirmed, by Patent, all the principal possessions of the Abbey. This Patent (printed 41 Harl. MS. 446, and Chartulary, so. 36. | 42 * 43 Regist. Langton, fos. 66, 68.

King Edward II.'s Charter of Free- Warren, to the Abbot and Convent of Haghmon, followed on April 27, 1320. It extends to their demesnes at Haghmon, Uffington, Downton, Grinsill, Hard wick, Muriden, and Linley, besides places already mentioned.45 In September 1326 Bishop Northburgh sends a letter to the Abbot and Convent, in which he sets forth the destitution of the bearer, \u2014 a man, who having been formerly ordained Priest by Bishop Langton, on a Title provided by the Abbey, had been so maltreated by Robbers, as to be utterly incapable of discharging any duties of his Office. The Bishop advises and exhorts the Convent, in common charity, to provide necessaries for a man so circumstanced, and in common decency not to allow a clergyman to beg. He concludes his letter with a hint about legal compulsion in case milder argu ments were unavailing.46 We next come to a reminiscence of the unfortunate Edmund Earl of Arundel, dated seventeen years after his execution. \u2014 On November 18, 1343, John de Cherleton Senior, John de Cherleton Junior, and John Tromwyn, Knights, and John son of Richard de Leighton, Knight, being at Salop, bind themselves to the Abbot of Haghmon in a penal bond of \u00a350., unless the first-named John de Cherleton should convey to the Abbey the Advowson of the Church of Lydom, to provide three Chaplains regular in the Church of Haghmon, to chant for the soul of the Lord Edmond Earl of Arundel for ever. A document of the year 1443 informs us of a design originated by Henry V. and encouraged by Henry VI., of founding a College without the walls of Oxford, for the special training of Students of the Augustine Order. An estate in the Oxford Parishes of St. Peter le Bailey and St. Michael, had now been bought for this pur pose, by the Prior and Convent of the Holy Trinity, London, as representatives of that Order. I presume the Abbot and Convent of Haughmond had subscribed to this purchase, for the London com munity binds itself in \u00a340. to the Haughmond community in case the said estate should be alienated or applied to any second purpose.47 The Valor of Henry VIII. gives us Abbot Thomas's account of the gross and net income of his House in the year 1535-6. \u2014 44 Monasticon, YI. 109, Num.

The alms for the poor were scanty indeed. \u2014 On Maundy -Thursday (c\u0153na do mini) 40s. were distributed by ordinance of the original Founder. By the same ordinance seven paupers, who prayed daily for the Founder, divided \u00a36. 13s. 4d. among themselves in a year :\u2014 in other words, each person had about one halfpenny per week. The Officers, who were receiving the income of the dissolved Monastery of Haughmond in 1541-2, returned items amounting to \u00a3297. 9s. 6\u00b1d., \u2014 an extraordinary approximation to the return of Abbot Thomas ; but we must remember that in the later account a fee-farm rent of only \u00a32. 8s. 7\\d. was received for the site and demesne-lands of Haughmond.48 These had been granted in the previous year (32 Henry VIII.) to Edmund Littleton. ABBOTS OF HAUGHMOND. Though it was only by accident that the Crown was called upon to sanction the election of an Abbot of Haughmond, and though we may search Patent-Rolls and Public Records in vain for anything like a list of these dignitaries, yet a very full account of their suc cession may be compiled from other sources. \u2014While the House was still a Priory, that is, about the year 1135, \u2014 Fulco was at its head as Prior. It is not apparent that he ever assumed the title of Abbot. Ingentjlf, Abbot of Haghmon, is Grantee in a Charter of the first William fitz Alan, which passed between 1155 and 1158.49 Alured, having been apparently Tutor (Nutricius) to King Henrv II. , when a youth, occurs as Abbot of Haghmon in or before 1170, and again in May 1172. William was Abbot here between the years 1176 and 1182. Richard occurs as Abbot before 1180; \u2014 also in 1186-7, 50 in November 1192, in October and November 1194, in October 1203, and in or after 1204.61 51 John, Abbot of Haughmond, is said in one List to occur in 5 John (1203-4).

Ralph, Abbot of Haghmon, attests a Charter of Bishop Mus champ in 1206,62 and is a frequent witness of other Charters be tween 1204 and 1210. Nicholas occurs as Abbot between 1217 and 1222. Osbert occurs between 1217 and 1222, and between 1220 and 1226.53 William (II.) occurs in August 1226 and October 1227. Ralph, whom we must call Ralph (II.) , is said to have suc ceeded William, but on evidence which in some particulars is er roneous.64 However, I have seen a Deed which shows that there was an Abbot Ralph at this period.54 Hervey was Abbot on June 25, 1236. In March 1241 the Abbacy was vacant, and in consequence (as I presume) of the co incident minority of John fitz Alan (II.) , the King's sanction was necessary to the election of \u2014 Engelard, a Canon of this House, to be its Abbot. Such as sent is expressed in a Patent of April 1, 1241. Engelard soon vacated by cession or death ; for other Patents of August 10 and August 24, 1241, addressed to the Bishop of Lichfield's Official, to the Sheriff of Shropshire, and to the Abbey tenants, certify the Royal assent to the election of \u2014 Gilbert, late Prior of Stanes, as Abbot. Gilbert occurs in office in 1245, 1246, 1248, and as late as August 1252.55 It is probable that the question about the right of Patronage, mooted in May 1253, 66 was relevant to a then existing vacancy ; indeed Gilbert is spoken of as the \" late Abbot \" in the Inquest held in that year. I presume that his successor was \u2014 Alexander, who appears to have been in office in January 1256 ;57 and perhaps three or four years later. John is said to have been Abbot in 48 Hen. III. (1263-4) ; but I cannot verify this statement, or say whether this was the Abbot John who is exhibited in one List58 as of the House of Le Strange, and (erroneously) as having held office as early as 28 Hen. III. (1243-4). We have an indication that an Abbot John survived the accession of Edward I. (Nov. 20, 1272) ,59 but I hardly trust it. Alan is said to have been Abbot in 2 Edw. I.

Henry de Astley received the Temporalities by Patent of December 4, 1280, when it will be remembered that Richard fitz Alan, Patron of the Abbey, was in ward to the Crown. This Abbot has occurred to us in 1281-2.61 Upon his death \u2014 Gilbert de Caumpeden was elected, and his election was con firmed by a Patent of July 27, 1284, a period which must have nearly coincided with the termination of Richard fitz Alan's mino rity. Gilbert was yet in office on October 21, 1304, and, though he resigned within two months afterwards, we have seen that he re mained an inmate of the Convent in June 1315. Meanwhile, that is, in December 1304, Hugh de Mortimer and Ralph de Leycester, Canons of Haghmon, went to King Edward I., and sought from him (because Edmund fitz Alan was under age, etc.) license to elect a new Abbot in place of Gilbert. The King gives the said license by a Writ of December 25, 1304. Another Writ of February 1, 1305, confirms the election of\u2014 Richard de Broke, Canon of Kenilworth. At his death in 1325, Richard, the Prior of Haghmon, and his Brethren elected \u2014 Nicholas de Longenore, a Canon of the House, as their Abbot. In a long letter written at Eccleshall on June 10, 1325, Bishop Roger de Northburgh minutely recites and examines the process of this election, and pronouncing all things to have been well and canonically done, confirms it. He commits the care of the Abbey to the Abbot elect. A second letter, entitled Inductio, is addressed to the Archdeacon of Salop or his Official, and contains the man date for the installation of the new Abbot. A third letter, entitled Admissio, is addressed to Brother Nicholas de Longenore himself, and admits him to the office of the late Abbot, whose name is here contradictorily and erroneously written as Thomas. By a fourth letter the Bishop apprises Edmund Earl of Arundel of what had been done in this matter, leaving the Earl to perform his part at his pleasure.63 In consideration of the increased means of the House, Abbot Nicholas built a new Kitchen at Haughmond, endowing it with the (as stated Vol. V. p. 28) is altogether a mistake.

On April 5, 1336, Abbot Nicholas grants to Hugh, son of Sir Roger de Cheyne, a Perpetual Chantry in the\" Church of Hagh mon, to be held by a Priest of the Monastery, celebrating daily services for the good estate of the said Hugh, and after his death, for the souls of himself, his ancestors, and successors.

On the death of Abbot Nicholas, about January 1346, the Canons duly and canonically elected \u2014 Richard de Brugge, one of their number, as his successor. By writs of February 7, 1346, Bishop Northburgh confirms the election, admits the new Abbot, orders his installation, and apprises the Earl of Arundel of such proceedings.64 Abbot Richard occurs as in office on July 28, 1348 ;65 but on November 23, 1348\u2014 John occurs as Abbot of Haghmon.66 Richard is named by one authority67 as Abbot in 1359 ; but I cannot verify this. I think it to be a mistake, and suppose that \u2014 John de Smethcote who occurs as Abbot in 1371, and on Oc tober 5, 1373, was identical with the former John. Nicholas Biriton was Abbot in June 1377, and in 3 Richard II. (1379-80). Ralph occurs as Abbot in 10 Richard II.

Abbot BurnelFs ordinance, for the duties and emoluments of the Ciaustral Prior and the Sub-Prior of Haughmon, bears date September 29, 1459, and is printed elsewhere.70 Abbot Burnel resigned in 1463, and in November 28 of that year the Canons petitioned William, Earl of Arundel, and Lord Mal travers, their Founder and Patron, for license to elect a new Abbot. On December 7 the Earl grants such license, though it appears that on the day of their petition the Canons had elected \u2014 John Ludlowe, D.D., Canon professed and Priest of Haghmon, to the office. The Earl being at Northampton on January 26, 1464, consents to this election and appoints the Abbot of Shrewsbury to receive the fealty and obeisance of the Abbot Elect, the Earl wishing to save the Convent the expense of a journey. On December 1, 1476, Abbot Ludlowe concedes to John le Strange, Lord of Knokyn and Mohun, and Jacinta his wife, a per petual Chantry in the Monastery, with a daily mass to be said at the Altar of St. Anne, Mother of the Virgin, for the souls of the said John and Jacinta, of Richard, late Lord Strange, and Elizabeth his wife, parents of John, and of Constancia, former wife of the said Richard. The endowment of the said Chantry is charged by John le Strange on the vill of Willecote in the demesne of Ness-Strange, if it should happen that the Church of Hanmer (which the Canons had by gift of the said John and his Ancestors, for the support of the said chantry) should realize less than 10 merks per annum, by reason of any Welsh rebellion or otherwise.71 John de Ludlowe was still Abbot in 18 Edward TV. (1478-9). Richard Pontesbury is said to have been Abbot in 1495. Christopher occurs as Abbot on March 22, 1526. Thomas Corvesor, the last Abbot, was in office in 1535-6. On September 9, 1539, he, with ten other Canons, surrendered his Monastery to the King, when a pension was assigned to him of \u00a340. a year. PIMLEY. To set down Pimley as a member of the Domesday Manor of Upton is more than I will venture to do dogmatically. I will <\u00bb Monasticon, VI. 112, No. XI. | ?1 Chartulary, fos. 85 b, and 86."], [344, "304 UPTON MAGNA. merely state negative reasons which induce me so to consider it.\u2014 It is not mentioned in Domesday ; \u2014 therefore it was involved in some other Domesday Manor. That Manor was probably in Re cordine Hundred ; \u2014 because Pimley was subsequently in Bradford Hundred. The Recordine Manors abutting on Pimley were only three, viz. Albrightlee, Uffington, and Upton. There is hardly a possibility that Pimley, from its subsequent history, can have been a member of Albrightlee or Uffington. Therefore I suppose it to have been a member of Upton. It is true that Pimley is not in Upton Parish : it is in the Parish of St. Mary's, Shrewsbury. But this is no conclusive objection to my view ; for Upton had another manorial member, viz. Sundorn, which was once in the Shrewsbury Parish of St. Alkmund. The history of Pimley is of some antiquarian interest. In the reign of Henry I. it was held by Fulcoius Vicecomes, a person whom I have often mentioned, and whose position was analogous to the Under- Sheriff or Deputy of the next century. As his chief was the Sheriff-in-fee, that is, Rainaldus, first, and Alan fitz Flaald, and William fitz Alan, afterwards, there is nothing more probable than that Fulcoius should have been enfeoffed in some part of a Sheriff's Manor, for instance in Pimley, a supposed member of Upton. In 1121 Fulcoius Vicecomes attests Henry I.'s great confirmation to Shrewsbury Abbey. He had not as yet been a Grantor to that House ; but King Stephen's Confirmation, which passed in 1136, tells how Fulcoius Vicecomes, at the burial of his wife, and with the consent of Henry his son, had given Pimelega to the said Abbey.1 This gift of Fulcoius is recorded in the later Confirmations of the Empress Maud, Henry II. , and Henry III. to Shrewsbury Abbey; and we know that the Seigneury of Pimley remained with that House till its Dissolution. In the reign of Henry II. the Abbot's Feoffee at Pimley was that Stephen de Pymbelg whose Fine, dated February 8, 1189, and settling certain disputes with the Abbot of Lilleshall, has been re cited under Hencot.2 In another, but nearly cotemporary, transac tion with Haughmond Abbey, this Stephen appears as Stephen son of Unerard de Midleton ; and in the Seal which he used on that occasion is called, I think, Stephen de Sidenun. The Canons of Haughmond had, it seems, a Mill in Uffington Manor, but situated on the Rivulet of Pimley or Pimbroc, which Rivulet divided Uffing- 1 Monasticon, III. 519, IL | 2 Supra, Vol. VI. pp. 368, 369."], [345, "305 PIMLEY. ton from Pimley. The Mill was called Pimley Mill. \u2014 \" For the sum of half a merk, Stephen, son of Unerard de Midelton, gives to the Canons of Haughmond his part of the bank of Pimbelega, to which the Canons' Mill was attached. He concedes also that they may fix their Mill, anywhere they choose, between the present Mill and the ford next below it. He further gives them the Moor which lay be tween the said ford and the Mill. Witnesses, \u2014 William fitz Alan, Hugh Pantulf, William de Botereus, Robert de Girros, Peter fitz Toret, Marscot, William de Wudeton, Alan de Etlega (Hadley), William de Ercaloua (High Ercall), Odo de Hodnet, Wido de Sau buri, Robert fitz Aer, and Ralph Hose.\" 3 The Haughmond Chartulary contains a Deed of less certain date, whereby Stephen de Pimbel gives to the Abbey a piece of land, de fined by trees, on the rivulet of Pimbroc. Witnesses, \u2014 Robert de Giros, Vivian de Rosall. By a third deed, which must have passed after the year 1215, and so twenty years later than the Deed first quoted, the same Stephen allows the Canons of Haughmond to make a stank for their Mill and Vivary of Pimbeley. Witnesses, \u2014 Sir John fitz Alan, Sir Thomas Maudut, and Robert his brother. Meantime, that is, on September 26, 1199, Stephen de Pimbelee, Plaintiff, renounces by Fine, a claim to one virgate in Erlavescote (Harlescot), for which he had sued Adam fitz William of Erlavescote, by process of Grand Asske. For this quit-claim the Tenant, Adam, paid 10s. On the Plea- Roll of Michaelmas Term 1201, I find several es soigns, or other allusions to a Suit, which Stephen de Pimbeleg seems to have had with the Provost and certain Burgesses of Shrews bury, viz. as to \" why they would not allow him to hold his land and pasture at Pimbeley in good peace, and in accordance with the right which he had established thereto in the Curia Regis.\" The Defendants named are Thomas the Provost, Alberic de la Cote, Geoffrey fitz Terric, Henry Wildegose, Robert Sitte, Thomas Puer, and Alberic fitz Tefric.

The Burgesses of Shrewsbury seem to have been rather prone to this kind of complaint. From a similar process which they had instituted against the Abbot of Shrewsbury, it ap pears that the Abbot's weir had not obstructed any usual passage, but that the usual passage had become choked, no one knew how. The Justices-in-Eyre gave no redress to the Plaintiffs in either case. It is evident that the ordinary channel had become choked, not by pourpresture of private parties, but by neglect of those who should have kept it open.4 During the course of his known career (1189-1221), I find Ste phen de Pimley attesting Charters of both Shrewsbury and Haugh mond Abbeys. In the Lilleshall Chartulary is preserved a Deed of his, whereby, with the consent of William his heir, he surrenders nearly all the advantages secured to him by the Fine of 1189; \u2014 that is, he gives to the Canons of Lilleshall \" all his share of the Bosc which lay between Hennechot and Pymbelee, and which had been in dispute in the Curia Regis.\" He reserves a right of com mon for his own cattle only, and \" surrenders to the Canons the Cyrograph (of 1189), which had been levied, before the King's Jus tices.\" I suppose that William, the above-named son of Stephen de Pimley, succeeded him, for I find a William de Pimbeleg attest ing certain grants to Haughmond Abbey, which must have passed about 1240 and 1241. This William had, by different wives, two sons, Geoffrey and William. He seems to have intended to disinherit the eldest son, Geoffrey, but to have failed to do so in a legal way. He actually executed a charter enfeoffing his younger son, Wil liam, in two-thirds of the Manor of Pimley, except a capital mes suage and 6 acres of land, which I -suppose, with the remaining third, constituted the dower of his second wife. It appears, how ever, that he died seized of the premises, having never divested him self of the actual possession, or changed his state. His son Geoffrey accordingly entered the same as heir-at-law. This we know took 4 A similar case has been the subject of a Lawsuit within the present Century. A Company interested in the navigation of the Severn, having neglected to keep open the ordinary channel at Preston- Boats, had taken an easy alternative by breaking up an adjoining Weir, which had been private property since the reign of Stephen. The Company was sued for damages, and, if I recollect the sequel, the Judge, who heard the cause, exhibited the same deference to private rights as the Justiciars of King John had done six centuries previously."], [347, "307 PIMLEY. place before January 1250, when an acre of Forest-land in Pymbel is included among Langley' s arrentations as set to Geoffrey de Pym bel at an annual rent of 9d. In 1254, however, William de Pimbel appears on the Pipe-Roll as fining one merk pro habendd assizd. We know, from another Record, that the said assize was one of novel disseizin against his elder brother Geoffrey, and that the cause was heard by Simon de Wanton. William de Pimley maintained that he had been seized of two-thirds of Pimley long before his Fa ther's death, and for three weeks after that event, till disseized by Geoffrey. Geoffrey, on the other hand, averred that William had never been seized at all, and consequently never disseized. The Jury of twelve found for Geoffrey. William now proceeded to convict these Jurors of perjury by the verdict of a Jury of twenty-four.5 The cause came on at the Assizes of 1256, Simon de Wanton again pre siding ; but Reyner le Rus, Richard de Pimley, and Cecily his wife, being associated with Geoffrey de Pimley in the defence. The whole of the above facts was now detailed, the verdict of the twelve Jurors was confirmed, and the Plaintiff was committed to prison.6 On the Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 it is stated as follows. \u2014 \" Geoffrey de Pembeleg is Lord of Pembeleg, and holds it of the Abbot of Salop for 5s. per annum. And there is a certain assart of that vill in the Forest of Haweman, which contains one acre and a quarter, and pays 9d. yearly to the Exchequer. The Vill does no suit to County or Hundred, and pays neither motfee nor stretward.\"1 Except as regards a slight discrepancy as to the extent of the Pim ley arrentation, this statement is very intelligible. The immunities of Pimley probably resulted from its connection with Shrewsbury Abbey. In what way Robert Burnell acquired Pimley I cannot certify. I think that he had it in 1272, and that Robert le Keu, who occurs at that date as a Tenant at Acton Burnell and as Bailiff of Pimley, was Burnell's Servant.8 A fragment of a Deed is preserved whereby Bishop Burnell gives his Manor of Pymbeleye (which he had previously given to William Burnel), to Thomas de Wythington and his wife Isabella, which Isabella was sister of the said William, and Cousin (consanguinea) of the Bishop.9 It is difficult to say who this William Burnell, cousin and grantee 5 For the process of Attaint, as this was called, vide supra, p. 81. 7 Rot.

There were several of the name, cotemporary with the Bishop, but all of them, except two, \u2014 the Out law and the Bishop's own brother, \u2014 seem to have survived him.10 Is it possible that the Bishop had lent a helping hand to his out lawed relative? Thomas de Wythington's \u00e6ra seems to have been from about 1289 to 1318, but I have nothing further to say of him under Pimley. The Seigneury of Pimley remained with Shrewsbury Abbey till its Dissolution. In the Minister's Accounts oi 1541-2, the assized rent of Pymley is put at 6s., and classed under the receipts from the Abbey-Foregate estate of the late Monastery.11 Pimley Mill and its annexed farm, though only partly in the Manor of Pimley, may be further spoken of here. On August 19, 1252, Gilbert, Abbot of Haughmond, assigns to the pittance of his Convent the Vivary of Pimbeleg, as well as 100s. rent due from Ron ton, by ordinance of Roger, Bishop of Lichfield.12 The Abbot of Lilleshall had, it seems, a charge of one merk per annum on the Abbot of Haughmond's Mill of Pimbeleg.13 This was, apparently, in compensation for such uses of the stream called Pimbrook,14 as, having belonged to the Abbot of Lilleshall's Manor of Albrightlee, had been conceded to the Canons of Haughmond for the benefit of their Mill at Pimley. The Valor of 1535-6 acknow ledges this due, both as paid by Haughmond and received by Lilles hall.

The older and greater associations which belong to this place must not tempt me beyond my sphere. I will not enumerate those tombs and relics, \u2014 those various evidences of Roman occupation, which have already been classified and described, with scrupulous care and learned sagacity, by another.1 I will not even discuss the etymology of names which have been fully examined by the same competent authority.2 Uriconium, or Wroxeter, at the date when my history commences, was no longer a City, or only a City of the dead. The fields which covered the ashes of the Proconsul and the Legionary are described in Domesday under far other relations. Wroxeter was a demesne- Manor of the Norman Sheriff of Shropshire. \u2014 \" The same Rainald holds Rochecestre. Toret held it (in Saxon times) and was a free man. Here is one hide, geldable. In de mesne there is an ox-team and half, and there are seven teams among the Serfs, male and female. Here are vn Villains, mi Boors, mi Priests, and one Radman. Amongst them all, they have mi ox-teams. Here is a Church and a league of wood. In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 40s. (per annum) ; now it is worth the same.\"3 There is something extraordinary in the figures here given. An Annual value of \u00a32. was not above the average for a hide of fertile soil; but the team-power employed, viz. 12| teams, is far in excess of such a hidage and such a value. I cannot help thinking that this excess of team-power may indicate the cotemporary progress of some extensive building operations. The once Collegiate Church of Wroxeter was richly endowed and greatly cherished by the Norman Lords of the Manor. Probably the fabric was of their construction. Moreover the Fitz Alans, Rainald's successors, are known to have had a Residence at Wroxeter. Perhaps Rainald was its builder. Of Toret, tbe Saxon, I spoke last under Langley.* Though living at Domesday, he had lost certain of his former possessions, and Wroxeter among the number. There is some appearance of 1 * 2 See Hartshome's Salopia Antiqua, I pp. 117-133, 90 and 91.

Of the central Manor of Wroxeter, as held in demesne by the Fitz Alans, I have very little to say beyond what has transpired under Upton Magna. The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 says that \"John fitz -Alan holds Wroccecestre, with its appurtenances, of the Barony of Ose waldistre, and of the King in capite.\" The Jurors knew not by what service he held it. He did suit to the County by his Senes chal, but not to the Hundred.\"6 The Assize-Roll of 1256 records, in part, a perambulation then made, between the land of the Abbot of Lilleshall in Uckington, and the land of John fitz Alan in Wroke cestre. A foss which descended to the bank of the River Time was part of the boundary. This John fitz Alan seems to have died at Wroxeter. The Manor constituted part of the dower which his widow Matilda carried to her second husband, Richard de Amundevill. On the death of this Lady in 1283, Wroxeter, with its Mill and Fishery, was valued at \u00a312. 9s. 2d. per annum ; and it then reverted to the estate of Rich ard fitz Alan, Matilda's Grandson. The Feodary of 1284 does not name Wroxeter, but a Tenure-Roll of Bradford-Hundred, not three years later, classes Wroxeter and Norton as members of Upton Magna, and as held by Richard fitz Alan in demesne. One Mano rial Court seems indeed to have sufficed for the whole. In the said Court, the Lord held Pleas of bloodshed and hue-and-cry, twice a year, and maintained a gallows. At the Assizes of 1292, Richard Ears of Arundel was presented as exercising a right of Free Warren in Upton and Wroxeter, but the right does not seem to have been questioned.7 In the Nomina Villarum of 1316, the Earl of Arundel is duly registered as Lord of Wroccestre. 5 \" Thoret de Wrochecester gave to Shrewsbury Abbey a piece of land in Salop called Rumaldesham, to make a garden.\" \u2014 Abbey includes some small grants which, though very early, had been omitted in the Confirmations of Henry I. and Ste phen.

I have already told the story how William fitz Alan (I.), having assisted King Henry II. in the siege of Bridgnorth and the reduction of Hugh de Mortimer, and being himself, after long exile, restored to his Shrievalty and estates, received the homage of his Vassals at Bridgnorth, and on the same day (July 25, 1155) gave the Church of Wroxeter to his Monastery of Haughmond.

Such Excavators, as they would be called in the scientific language of the nineteenth century, were deemed to be criminals in the thirteenth. The Record solemnly tells us how \" Wil liam son of William de Hodeney, Walter de Drayton, William Parson of Ledewych, and Richard Tyffe, had dug by night at Wroccestre, in search of treasure ;\" \u2014 how the first-named Digger was in prison, and how the second had died.

There was evi dently some doubt about the efficacy of the above Deeds, then and afterwards ; a doubt which probably caused the Canons of Haugh mond to procure the following Certificates from John le Strange and Roger de Powis, as to their recollections on the subject.

By six generations of the Fitz Alans the claims of Haugh mond Abbey to the Church of Wroxeter were utterly ignored. . The Taxation of 1291 estimates the Church of Wroxeter as worth \u00a323. 6s. 8d. per annum. There were three Rectors thereof. The Portion of the first was 20 merks, of the second 10 merks, and of the third 5 merks.18 In the years 1331 and 1332, Richard, Earl of Arundel, by various Charters, restored the Advowson of Wroxeter to Haughmond Abbey.19 On October 21, 1341, \" Roger Charles, Seneschal of the Earl of \u00bb Harl.

Arundel in the Marches\" (of Wales), gave the Abbot of Haugh mond seizin of 3 acres of waste in the wood of Norton-juxta-Wrox eter.20 In 1341, when the Parish of Wroxeter was taxed to the Ninth, there were still three Portioners here. These Portioners held all the land of the Vill of Norton in demesne, as glebe of the Church, and the said Vill was a good part of the Parish. For this reason, and because the Portioners, in common with other Clergy, paid Tenths to the King on their glebe land, and were not subject to the Ninth, the Assessors rated the Parish at 1 0 merks only, in stead of at 35 merks, \u2014 the Church-taxation. This assessment, how ever, included the Temporalities of the Abbot of Shrewsbury within the Parish;21 \u2014 alluding to his estate at Eyton-upon- Severn. A manifesto by Richard (de Brugge), Abbot of Haughmond, dated October 3, 1347, announces the virtual dissolution of the Collegiate Church of Wroxeter, and the consent of Bishop Northburgh to the measure. The document recites how Richard (Peche), Bishop of Coventry, had anciently allowed an appropriation of the Church to Haughmond Abbey ; how the Abbey had held it for a long time in a state of appropriation ; how the Canons had then been ejected by power, wrongfully exercised; and how at length Bishop Roger (not the Earl of Arundel) had of late restored them to their rights. The Abbot proceeds to ordain the future Vicarage and its portions. He gives the Vicar that manse in the vill of Wroxcestre in which the Parish Priest (Sacerdos parochialis) had been used to dwell, also two messuages, now inhabited by Edith Crowe and Joan de Rodyngton, with the curtilages adjacent, also all the arable land which Sir Ro bert le Notinge had in demesne, as pertaining to that portion in the Church which he held when living. The Vicar was further to have the tithes of wool, lamb, hay, curtilages, fisheries, weirs, milk (lactunii), geese, ltitle pigs, bees (i. e. honey), goats, dove-cots, eggs, flax, hemp, and apples; also all annual heriots, alive or dead, ex cept those which belonged to the Abbot, in virtue of his demesne (racione dominii) ; also all oblations, charity-pence (denarios cari tatis), and the whole altarage of the Church, by whatever name it might be described. He was also to have an annual pension of 5s. from Little Buildwas, 8s. rent in the vill of Eyton, and 2s. in the vill of Clotleg (Cluddley) ; also the tithes of the Abbot of Shrews bury's demesnes at Eyton, and all the tithes of the vill of Rusche ton (Rushton) . On the other hand, the Vicar was to pay 10s. to the Archdeacon for procurations, and 2s. for synodals, yearly. He 20 Chartulary, ut supra. | -' Inquis. Nonarum, p. 184."], [359, "315 THE CHURCH. was to serve the Church of Wroxeter and the Chapel of Eyton by proper Ministers, and as they had been served from ancient time. All other burdens of the Church the Abbot takes upon himself and his Successors. The above Ordinance was sealed, by the Abbot's wish, with the Seal of the Archdeacon's Official, as well as with the common Seal of the Abbey.22 On November 11, 1347, the first Vicar of Wroxeter was admitted by Bishop Northburgh, at the pre sentation of the Abbot and Convent of Haughmond. The Haughmond Chartulary preserves another partition of the tithes of Wroxeter, in which the following items are assigned to the Vicar, viz. the whole tithes of all fields in Norton, except glebe ; the whole tithes of Rushton ; the fortieth Sheaf of the demesne lands at Eyton ; the thirtieth Sheaf of three tenements there ; two waggon-loads of hay therefrom ; and the tithes of his own glebe there. The Rector, or Abbot, had, on the other hand, the whole tithe of all the fields of Wroxeter ; \u2014 except that, as regarded the demesne-lands, two out of every three Tithe-Sheaves went to the Chaplain of St. Mary,23 while the third Sheaf only remained to the Rector. The Rector further had the whole tithes of the field of Okinton (Uckington), called Austaneshill, near Beslow ; the whole tithes of all fields of Beslow, Donington, Drayton, and Sewal lesdon (a place now lost) ; of five tenements in Eyton- Abbots, and of one furlong in Drayton, between Eyton and Drayton ; and of 18 half- virgates in the fields of Opynton (Uppington). The Valor of 1531^5 gives the preferment of John Hall, Vicar of Rockcetor, as \u00a312. per annum, less 10s. for procurations and 2s. for synodals.24 At the same time the Rectory of Wroxcetour was re turned by the Abbot of Haughmond as yielding an annual ferm of \u00a38. There was in Wroxeter Church a Chantry, dedicated to St. Mary, to the Chaplain of which the Abbot paid \u00a32. yearly, \" by gift of the Founder.\"25 RECTORS OR PORTIONERS OP WROXETER.26 There are no means whatever of assigning to the earlier Digni- 22 Regist.

In the first instances, therefore, I class all the Rectors, whose names I can find, in order of date, without reference to their individual Stalls. Denys, Godfather of William fitz Alan (I.), resigned his prefer ment, whatever it was, in 1155. William de Drayton was probably a Portioner here for 50 years, commencing about the year 1225. The variety of ways in which he is described deserves remark, e.g. Willielmus de Dray ton, Capellanus; Willielmus Capellanus de Drayton; Willielmus de Drayton, clericus ; Willielmus Sacerdos de Dreyton ; Willielmus Per sona; Willielmus Presbyter de Wroxeter; Willielmus Canonicus de Wroxeter; Dominus Willielmus de Drayton, Capellanus; Dominus Willielmus de Drayton, Rector ecclesi\u00e6 de Wroxeter ; Willielmus Por cionarius in ecclesid de Wroxeter. I doubt not, moreover, that he was the Willielmus Capellanus who in 1231 was amerced 4 merks, because his hounds coursed in the Royal Forest, and whose Secu rities were Herbert Mauveysin and Thomas de Constantine. His further irregularities seem to be indicated by the appearance of his son Alan on one occasion. In January 1277 he was deceased, for then did King Edward I. recover against Richard de Munde ville and Matilda his wife, and against Simon fitz Walter (probably Mundeville's Presentee), \" the presentation to that Portion of Wrox eter which William de Drayton had held.\"27 Randulph Shaw, Parson of Wroxeter, is named in a Deed with out date. On January 18, 1275, \u2014 William de Blankeny, a Portioner of Wrekwrthyn (read Wroxeter), being deceased, King Edward I., as Custos of the late John fitz Alan's lands, presents \u2014 Nicholas de Bassingburne to the vacant Portion.28 In 1276\u2014 Henry de Len was presented to a Prebend here, by King Edward I., as Custos of John fitz Alan's heir.29 In 1278\u2014 John Burnell was presented to one Prebend, and \u2014 Roger Beneyt to another, by the King, in the same right.30 RECTORS OF THE FIRST PORTION.

On April 18, 1301, his portion was sequestered, and on May 31 the Bishop instituted \u2014 Roland de Viquiria, Acolyte, to the same, on the presentation of Richard, Earl of Arundel. On December 3, 1309, this Por tioner has a year's license of absence, studendi gratia ; but on June 5, 1314, his Portion, being sequestered, was committed to the custody of \u2014 John de Cheyny, Acolyte (son of Roger de Cheyny), who it seems had been presented to the same, but whose title to be insti tuted was long in question. However, on April 2, 1317, the Bishop admits John de Cheyne, at presentation of Edmund, Earl of Arundel. On February 3, 1318, John de Cheyne has a year's license for study, and on March 10 following, was, as we have seen, instituted to Cound.31 On the same day \u2014 Sir John de Braundon was admitted to Cheyne's Portion at Wroxeter, on the presentation of Edmund, Earl of Arundel. On October 3, 1322, Brandon had license of non-residence, as being in the service of Sir Hugh le Despenser. On December 6, 1325, this license was renewed for two years, Despenser, in conformity with the known period of his exaltation, being styled Lord Earl of Winchester. On September 21, 1331, Brandon having resigned, \u2014 William de Hopton, Priest, was admitted, at presentation of the Abbot and Convent of Haghmon, whose right to one Portion in this Church seems to have been recognized in a Patent of 1327. Hopton died on November 28, 1331 ; and, on January 4, 1332, \u2014 \u25a0 John de Coventre, Chaplain, was admitted, on presentation of the same Abbot and Convent. He, it seems, was an attache of Sir Hugh le Despenser (Grandson of the Earl of Winchester), and had licenses of non- residence in 1338, 1339, and 1341. In the latter year he is the first-named of the Wroxeter Portionists in the as sessment of the Ninth, and he appears to have remained here till 1347. RECTORS OF THE SECOND PORTION.

On Au gust 2, 1308, the Bishop institutes \u2014 James de Tifforo, Priest, to a third part of this Church, Ed mund, Earl of Arundel, presenting. On September 28, 1322, Tif ford exchanges preferments with \u2014 William de Hodenet, late Rector of Madeley, who is admitted at presentation of the same Earl Edmund. Hodenet is the second named of the Portioners of 1341, and remained a Rector till 1347, when, it would seem, he accepted the Vicarage. RECTORS OF THE THIRD PORTION. Robert de Warrewyk occurs as a Portioner of Wroxeter from 1283 to 1293.33 On December 21, 1323, being in a state of dotage (senio confractus), Hugh Wilchar of Lichfield, Chaplain, is appointed his Curator, by the Bishop. Robert Notekyn,34 Portioner of Wroxeter, died February 17, 1333; and, on March 11, the Bishop admitted \u2014 John de Longeleye, Clerk, on the presentation of the Abbot and Convent of Haughmond. John de Longeleye is the third mentioned of the three Portioners of 1341 ; and, at Michaelmas of that year, he died. On December 30 following \u2014 William de Brugge, Clerk, was instituted to the vacancy, \"Richard, Earl of Arundel, presenting (hoc vice), and having power so to do from the true Patrons, the Abbot and Convent of Haughmond.\" I suppose it was this Portioner, who, as \" Sir Wil liam de Wroccestre, Portioner of a (or the) third Portion of the Church of Wroccestre,\" appears in 1346, as failing to prosecute a suit about Uppington Chapel, which he had promoted in the Court of Canterbury against the Prior and Canons of Wombridge and others.35 William de Brugge was here in 1347.

William Opynton, Priest, admitted October 22, 1393, died in 1401. William Amyas, Priest, admitted May 25, 1401, died in 1409. The Patrons in the five last instances were the Abbot and Con vent of Haughmond. NORTON. This member of Wroxeter is said in one instance to have been all Glebe.37 Another document assures us that there were fields in Norton which were not glebe.38 It is clear to me that an estate in Norton, or Wroxeter, or both, was separated from the demesne of the first William fitz Alan, and given by him to Robert Dardif, or De Ardi. Hence we find that in 1165 Robert de Ardi was holding one fee of new feoffment in the Barony of Fitz Alan.39 I do not suppose that what De Ardi had in Wroxeter constituted the whole of this fee, but whatever he had, probably lay on that side of the Manor which was bounded by Beslow and Uckington. As very little is known of Robert de Ardi, every fact is of im portance, and I venture to suggest that he was the same person with Robert de Hardif, who, in the same year, 1165, was Copar cener with one Adam de Eton in half a Staffordshire fee, \u2014 held by them under Hervey de Stratton, and by Hervey de Stratton under the Baron Stafford.40 Again I should notice how about 1175 Hugh de Laci and Robert Dardif attest John le Strange's certificate concerning Wroxeter Church.41 It seems that Robert de Ardif and Milana his wife had a vivary, or fish-pond, near Okinton (Uckington), and were in receipt of a rent of I2d. from the Canons of Lilleshall, for a watercourse which ran from this pond to the said Canons' MiD.42 This rent Robert and his 36 Called Amyas under Condover (Vol. VI. p. 32), and again on his readmission here in 1401. 33 \u25a0 4\u00b0 Liber Niger, I. 144, 136. 41 Supra, p. 313. 42 The Mill alluded to, as belonging to the Canons of Lilleshall, seems to have 3? \u25a0*> Supra, pp. 314 and 315."], [364, "320 WROXETER. wife gave to the maintenance of the house of the infirm poor at Haughmond Abbey. They gave it for the souls of themselves, their ancestors, and heirs, and for the soul of Hugh de Lacy. Witnesses, Robert Chaplain of Withington, Reyner de Acton.43 It is evident, I think, that D'Ardif's feoffment in Wroxeter re verted to the Fitz Alans as Seigneural Lords. LITTLE BUILDWAS. This Vill must not for a moment be confused with the Bishop of Chester's Manor of Buildwas. The River Severn divided the two, and Little Buildwas was, parochially and manorially, an isolated member of the distant Church and Manor of Wroxeter. This an cient status was primarily obliterated by a grant made by the first William fitz Alan to Buildwas Abbey. He gave the Vill of Little Buildwas to that House, probably at the time of its foundation, and if so, early in the reign of Stephen. The second William fitz Alan coming into possession of his estates in 1175, confirmed and in creased his Father's gift by a Charter which I will give in full. \u2014 In nomine Sanct\u00e6 et individu\u00e6 Trinitatis, ego Willielmus, filius Willielmi filii Alani, pro salute anim\u00e6 me\u00e6, et pro animabus patris et matris me\u00e6, concessi et confirmavi, sicut pater meus concessit et dedit, Deo et Sanct\u00e6 Mari\u0153 et monachis de Buldewas, tarn presenti bus quam futuris, villain qu\u00e6 vocatur Parva Buldewas, cum omnibus ad earn pertinentibus, in terra et aqua, in silva, in pratis et pascuis : ita scilicet liberam el quietam ab omni exactione seculari, ut nichil in ed retinuerim, nisi solummodo tutelam contra aliorum incursiones.

Accordingly we find Alan de Bildwas attesting two grants to that Abbey in the time of Henry IL, one of which is precisely dated in 1176.46 Again we have Alan de Buildwas attesting two Charters of Richard I.'s time, one of which passed in November 1192.47 Whether these attestations belong to two persons, father and son, I cannot say ; but we have had evi- dence under Posenall that an Alan de Buildwas was deceased in 1226, having left a widow, Agnes, and a son and heir, Alan.48 On August 30, 1228, this second Alan de Buildwas, as I may hypo- thetically call him, is found impleading his Suzerain, the Abbot, concerning a stank in Buildwas. In January 1230, the same Abbot and Roger Springhose were at issue concerning their re- spective rights to the custody of the lands and heir of this Alan. I think Springhose sought the right as a relation, for in the agree- ment to which the Litigants came, he acknowledges the Abbot's right, \" because the deceased had held under the Abbot.\" In turn, the Abbot conceded the custody and marriage of the heir to Spring hose, for a sum of 8 merks.49 The Abbot paid the King half a merk pro licentid concordandi in this case.

In the same interval he attests a Build was Deed (which I shall give under Leighton) as Alan de Parva Buldewas. In 1251, I find the Abbot of Buildwas taking out a Writ against John fitz Alan for some disseizin in Parva Buldewas. The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 not only assures us that Little Buildwas was still remembered to have been manorially a member of Wroxeter, but shows us that Alan de Buildwas's services to the Abbot had become a kind of Serjeantry, which satisfactorily accounts for his, and his Ancestor's, frequent attestations of the Abbey Charters. \u2014 \" Alan de Buldewas,\" says the Record, \" is Lord of Parva Buldewas, and holds under the Abbot of Buldewas by this manner of service, viz. that he shall ride with the Abbot anywhither in England at the Abbot's will and at the Abbot's charges. And (the Vill) is hidated together with the Manor of Wroccester, and does no suit to County or Hundred.\" 50 At the Forest Assizes of 1262, Alan de Buldewas was in due attendance, \u2014 optulit se primo die. He, it seems, and Robert de Stanton, stood indicted for taking a stag. At the same time we have Geoffrey de la Holte of Little Buildwas amerced 2s. for de. fault. The Taxation of 1291 gives the Abbot of Buildwas an assized rent of 6s. 8d. in Little Buildwas.51 I cannot tell how this could arise unless it were the estimated value of the Tenant's services. It seems that Alan de Buildwas (III.) left a daughter and sole heir, Alice, who became the wife of Edmund de Leynham. This lady, as yet unmarried, and being styled Alice de Buildwas, was sued at the Assizes of 1292 for a toft and half virgate in Posenhall, in which the Plaintiff (Thomas le Frensche of Bradeleye) alleged that she had no ingress save through Alan de Buldewas, who had held the same for a term, now expired, by demise of Agnes de Bradeleye, the Plaintiff's mother. The defendant, AUce, acknow ledged that she had ingress by Alan (her Father, I presume), but denied that the said Alan had been demisee of Agnes, for that the latter had never been seized of the premises.

In pursuance of a King's Writ, dated Dec. 7, 1302, an Inquest was held on Dec. 28 following at Little Buildwas. It was found to be no injury to the Crown, if Edmund de Lenham and his wife Alice should have license to give the Manor of Little Buildwas to the Abbot and Convent under whom they held it. Their services to the Abbot were as follows. \u2014 Edmund and his wife were to place the first dish on the Abbot's table at Buildwas every Christmas-day, and were to ride with the Abbot anywhither within the four seas, at the Abbot's charges. The Manor contained a capital messuage, six cottages, 120 acres of arable and five acres of meadow land, and was worth \u00a31. 18s. Qd. per annum. The Grantors would still have a messuage, a carucate of land, three acres of meadow, 20s. ren.t, and 60 acres of bosc in Posenhale, \u2014 an estate quite sufficient to bear all the customs and services accruing to the Crown from both tenements.63 We have a double and very instructive proof of the way in which such transactions were closed. By a Deed, dated at York on May 1, 1303, Edmund de Leynham and his wife, Alice, daugh ter of Alan, formerly Lord of Little Buildwas, grant and quit-claim that Manor to the Abbot and Convent for ever; \u2014 to hold of the Chief Lords of the Fee by accustomed services. Witnesses, \u2014 Sirs Walter de Beyseyn, John de Lee, Richard de Leyghtone, Augo (i.e. Hugo) le Fizeyre (Fitz Aer), Reginald son of Reginald de Charnes, and Michael de Moreton.54 Again we have a Fine, levied June 25, 1303, whereby the same Edmund and Alice, as Deforciants of the Manor of Parva Buldewas (whereof was plea of convention), quitclaim the same to Henry, Abbot of Buldewas, Plaintiff. The latter covenants to pay the Recognizors an annuity of 20 merks, terminable with their lives ; and in default gives them a power of distress on his estates at Edweneye, Stirchley, and Walton. This Fine purports to be levied per preceptum Regis, and is indorsed with a memorandum that Geoffrey son of William del Holt (whom we know to have been an Undertenant in Little Buildwas) opposes his claim. At Buildwas Abbey, on June 24, 1312, the son of this Geoffrey, calling himself Geoffrey, son of Geoffrey de la Holte, quit-claims to the Abbot all his right and interest in Little Buildwas or any part thereof.

The proceeds of this estate, immediately before and after the Dissolution of Buildwas Abbey, have been already given.56 Of Undertenants here I may name three persons, Orin, William, and Acer, who, at the Forest Assizes of 1180 were amerced Is. each for pourpresture. About 1210-15, one Alan de Bellewas, Clerk of Bellewas, attests a Leighton Deed. On Oct. 29, 1227, Adam, a Chaplain, being Tenant of 16 acres in Parva Bildewas, whereof was suit-at-law, surrenders the same to William fitz Geoffrey. The latter in turn concedes the premises (except two messuages, held by Ralph de Calvedon and Adam de Tibreton), to the Recognizor j \u2014 to hold for life at a rent of lSd., and for two merks now paid down. At the Chaplain's death, the premises are to revert to William and his heirs. I take it that this William fitz Geoffrey was father of that Geoffrey de la Holte who occurs in 1262 and 1303. If so, we have four generations of this family complete, viz. Geoffrey (sans date), William (1227), Geoffrey (1262-1303), and Geoffrey (1312). BUILDWAS CHURCH. This was, at its foundation, a. mere Chapel, subject to Wroxeter. The Pension of 5s., which the Incumbent of Buildwas paid, first to the Co- Rectors, and afterwards to the Vicar, of Wroxeter, was probably a composition in lieu of the tithes of Little Buildwas. Inasmuch as William fitz Alan's Charter of 1175 says nothing about the Chapel or Advowson of Little Buildwas, I conclude that the Chapel was founded at a later period by the Monks of Build was. The latter too appear as Patrons of the Living, before they acquired the fee-simple of the Manor, so that the foundation must not be ascribed to any descendant of Alan fitz Berenger. It is very remarkable that the Monks of Buildwas managed to annex the parochial cure of the Abbatial Manor of Great Buildwas to the Church of Little Buildwas. It is most probable that Great Buildwas was originally in Cound Parish. This change of a paro chial boundary, so rare in occurrence, must be attributed to the 55 Monasticon, V. 359, No. XIX. 56 Supra, Vol. VI. p. 332."], [369, "325 LITTLE BUILDWAS. influence of a Cistercian House, backed by that of the Diocesan Bishops, its Founders. Little Buildwas is neither mentioned as a Chapelry in the Taxation of 1291, nor distinguished as a Parish in the Inquisition of 1341. I take it, however, that the Chapel existed at an earlier period, and that \u2014 Alan de Buildwas, Clerk of Buildwas, who occurs about 1210-15, was its Incumbent. The following names of later In cumbents are from the Diocesan Registers of Lichfield, the Patrons in every case being the Abbot and Convent of Buildwas. \u2014 Sir Richard de Morton, Chaplain, instituted Nov. 28, 1298, to the Chapel of Parva Buldewas, died August 5, 1311. Sir Thomas de Brocton, Priest, admitted Sept. 10, 1311, is certified on the Register, to be \" liable to a pension (pensionarius) to the Mother Church of Wroxcester, of 5s. per annum.\" William, Rector of Parva Buldewas, died June 4, 1349 (pro bably of the prevailing pestilence) , and \u2014 William, surnamed Tandy, Chaplain, was admitted on June 29 following. On December 27, .1349, William Tandy was collated by the Bishop to the Chapel of Eaton Constantine, and on March 18, 1350, was instituted to the Vicarage of the Holy Cross, Shrews bury.57 Tandy is stated on the Register to have vacated Buildwas about Feb. 2, 1350. Hugh Boldyng, Chaplain, admitted here on March 21, 1350, re signed on June 15 following ; and on July 24, 1350 \u2014 Thomas de Aston, Chaplain, was admitted here. After this the Incumbents of Little Buildwas cease to be instituted by the Diocesan Bishops. In this extraordinary way the Church became a Peculiar, and remained so to the present century. It is not mentioned in the Valor of 1534-5. We have seen that in 1536-7, the Rectorial Tithes of Buildwas were accounted among the assets of the dissolved Monastery.58 iUiijljttm- In Domesday this Manor appears as one of those held in demesne \u00bb Vide Hist.

He (Rainald) found it waste.\"1 The reign of Henry I. closed about 50 years after Domesday. Within that 50 years Rainald, or one of his Successors, enfeoffed a Tenant in Leighton. That Tenant was Ancestor of the knightly family which took a name from the place, and which has borne its part in Shropshire history from that day to this. The labours of Heralds have been bestowed on the early part of this genealogy with ruinous effect. Invention has supplied the place of fact, and thus an ancient pedigree, which needed no adornment or addition, has been supplanted by an incredible myth. Tihel, or Tiel, the known ancestor of the Leightons, was pro bably the first Feoffee who held the Manor, and his \u00e6ra was, if so, the reign of Henry I. His name is apparently Saxon, but the Arms borne by the Leightons point, I think, to some early alliance with the influential House of Fitz Warin. Tihel de Lahtune, as he is in this instance called, survived the restoration of Henry II. to the throne, and of the first William fitz Alan to his Shropshire estates. Between the years 1155 and 1160, he attests two Charters; \u2014 one where Gilbert fitz William of Hadnall makes a grant of land to Haughmond Abbey, \u2014 the other a cotemporary confirmation of the said grant, evidently by William fitz Alan himself.2 Before the year 1165 Tihel had been succeeded by his son, who appears in the Liber Niger as \u2014 Richard fitz Tiel, and as holding one knight's-fee oi old feoff ment, in the Barony of Fitz Alan.3 In 1177 we find Richard fitz Tiell paying the half of a sum of 40s. in which he had been amerced by King Henry II. for forest-trespass. The Justices recently in eyre, had also amerced Richard fitz Tihel 20s., apparently for giving false evidence (quia negavit quod postea recognovit) ? In the year 1178 he had discharged both his debts, and was quit? The Shrop shire Forest- Roll of 1180 commences with a series of persons and places which we see at once to have belonged to the Jurisdiction or Baibwick of the Wrekin.

I2d. for a pourpresture in Lecton, and Richard de Lekton is assessed 7s. for an imbladement of 7 acres of corn. Also Richard de Lehton is amerced 2s. for waste. The Pipe-Roll of 1188 shows Richard de Leocton paying a fine of 6s. %d. which the Justices-in-Eyre had put upon him for disseizin. On December 5, 1194, Richard de Letton having a suit pending at Westminster against William de Hetleia (Hadley), excused himself from attending, by the essoign called de malo veniendi. His Essoignor was John de Rile.6 I am inclined to think that all the above extracts relate to Richard de Leighton (I.), alias Richard fitz Tiel; but inasmuch as he was succeeded by a son and grandson of the same name, it is not easy to mark the points of interval in this succession. It was perhaps \u2014 Richard de Leighton (II.) , who, as Richard de Lecton, was sub jected to a charge of half a merk in 1200 by Hugh de Nevill, then Justice of the Forest, and who paid the debt in 1201. Perhaps also the following Deed, which certainly passed about 1200 or 1201, may he looked upon as a Confirmation, granted by the Suzerain, at the period of the Grantee's succession. So interesting a document should be given in its original language. \u2014 \" Omnibus Christi fidelibus ad quos presens scriptum pervenerit, Willielmus filius Willielmi, filii Alani, salutem.

Leaving that matter to a note,9 I proceed to state my opinion that the next Richard de Leighton who occurs was son and heir of the above Benefactor to Buildwas Abbey. With this idea I class the following extracts under the name of \u2014 Richard de Leighton (III.), though I leave it a question whe ther some of the earlier ones relate to him or his Father. In the struggles which closed the reign of John we have seen that Sir Hugh de Sheinton, being one of the Coroners of Shropshire, remained a Royalist.

Hence a Writ-Close of April 10, 1216, orders the Sheriff of Shropshire to hand over to John fitz Philip the lands of Richard de Leghton in Leghton and Garmundeston (Garmeston), which lands, together with those of Thomas de Costentin, unless they were of more than \u00a320. (annual) value, the King had granted to the said John.10 A Writ of King Henry III., dated Nov. 3, 1217, certifies the Sheriff of Shropshire that Richard de Letton had returned to his allegiance.11 Such a Writ was of course tantamount to an order for the restoration of his estates. Accordingly, at the Assizes of Nov. 1221, we have Sir Richard de Lechton, as a Knight, and as a Selector of other Knights, who tried certain causes of Grand Assize. At these same Assizes he was called to warranty by his Tenant, Robert de Wodecot, who was impleaded for a part of Leighton Mill. A Writ of King Henry III., dated at Ludlow on October 2, 1224, orders that Richard de Lecton, Richard de Mid delhope, and Thomas de Constantine, being three of the King's Verderers for Shropshire, shall not, as long as they hold that office, be put on any Assizes, Juries, or Recognitions ; but the Sheriff was not to remove them from any panel on which they were already serving.12 However, in August 1226, all three persons appear on a Jury of the chief men of Shropshire, to try certain issues con nected with the Stiperstones Forest. The Pipe-Roll of 1231 exhibits Richard de Lecton and Thomas de Constantine once more in conjunction, viz. as sureties for Gil bert de Bukenhull. It would be tedious to requote the various deeds already set forth, which show Richard de Leighton and Richard de Middelhope in each other's company about this time. In Mi chaelmas Term 1237, Richard de Middelhope, Thomas de Constan tine, and Richard de Lecton appear as Fellow-Jurors in a great cause heard before the King at Worcester. The Feodary of 1240 duly registers Richard de Letton as holding a knight's-fee in Letton, in the Barony of John fitz Alan.13 In the same year Richard de Legton was impleaded by William de Erleton for refusing to allow the said William reasonable estovers in Legton bosc, such as he had been used to have, viz. husbote and other estovers. By Fine levied on November 18, 1240, Richard de Legton allows the demand, subject to the purview of his own Fo rester. For this the Plaintiff gave a sore sparrow-hawk. io . ii . r: 2?o_. Claus.

A Patent of July 14, 1241, again associates Richard de Leghton and Richard de Middelhope as Justices, to deliver Shrewsbury Gaol, and to try a civil suit at the next County-Court. I shall elsewhere give proof that in or after the year 1242 Richard de Leighton was still acting as a Verderer of the Shropshire Forests. On two Inquests, held pursuant to Writs of May 7 and July 9, 1246, and which have been set forth under Caus,14 Richard de Leighton was a Juror. Perhaps the year 1249 is the latest date which can be assigned to any of the numerous attestations of Sir Richard de Leighton (III.)./ Even at that rate his activity would seem to have been nearly coextensive with his life, for within the next three years he was certainly deceased. William de Leighton, who in the year 1256 appears in the important post of Constable of Oswestry, was son* and successor of Richard. He attests, apparently as a knight, and at a somewhat earlier period, a Charter to Buildwas Abbey, \u2014 which I have set forth under Ragdon.15 I find notice of a Charter whereby in the year 1252 \u2014 \" William, son of Richard, Lord of Leithone, grants his Mill of Leithone to God and Saint Milburg and the Monks of Wenlock.\"16 1 have never seen any evidence that this gift held good ; indeed it is strange to find a Leighton thus granting to Wenlock in preference to Buildwas. The latter House, as we shall see, obtained a Mill in Leighton the very next year, and, though not by William de Leigh ton's grant, yet apparently with his sanction. The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 gives important evidence about Leighton. \" William, Lord of Leheton, holds the Manor of Leheton of John fitz Alan by service of one knight's-fee in time of war, at Oswestry Castle, for forty days, and at the Tenant's charges. And the Manor is in hides (the Domesday estimate) and pays 12c.. per annum for stretward and \\2d. for rnotfee, and does due suit to County and Hundred.\" \u2014 \" The Abbot of Buildwas obtained entry into the said Manor in respect of one meadow, in the time of the said William's Grand father ; and he holds the said meadow in pure alms ; and it is worth one merk yearly.\" \u2014 \" The same Abbot bought a certain Mill from Robert de Wodecote 14 Supra, pp. 22, 23.

It helps to prove four generations in the Leighton Pedigree, for we learn that Richard, son of another Richard de Leighton and Grantor of the meadow aforesaid, was William de Leighton's Grandfather. At the Assizes of 1256, William de Leighton was one of the two Jurors of Bradford Hundred who chose the rest of the Panel. The Justices pronounced him and other knights in miser icor did for re fusing to make some Perambulation which they had ordered. On April 2, 1258, we have Sir William de Leghton, Knight, Constable of Oswestry, testifying in full Court of the Hundred of Oswestry to a grant then made to Haughmond Abbey.18 In Easter Term 1260, William de Lecton was one of the only two Jurors who appeared at Westminster to certify as to their previous verdict in the famous Trial between Thomas Corbet of Caus and Fulk fitz Warin.19 I shall hereafter cite evidence to show that Sir William de Leighton died in 1263, apparently about the month of March. In perfect consistency with such a date we find early mention of his son and successor, whom I will call \u2014 Richard de Leighton (IV.) ; for a Patent of February 18, 1263, includes Richard de Lecton among those who were to be protected from all Law-suits, etc., till June 24 following, and as long as there should be war with Wales. Richard de Leighton then undoubtedly shared in the toils of that period, so memorable on the Shropshire Borders, when the Princes of North Wales and of Powys stood leagued with De Montfort against the English Crown. This Richard de Leighton succeeded his Father as a Coparcener in the Manor of Stanwardine-in-the-Fields. How this arose I shall consider elsewhere ; but I may here state that in the course of a Suit which, in 1272, Richard de Leighton had, concerning a lease of lands at Eyton (near Stanwardine), he was obliged to prove inci dentally the date of his Father's death. Of this information I have already availed myself. V Rot. Hundred. II. 57. 18 Haughmond Chartulary, so. 234-b. 13 Vide supra, p. 82."], [376, "332 LEIGHTON. On January 27, 1282, a Fine was levied at Westminster between Robert (Burnell), Bishop of Bath and Wells, Plaintiff, and Richard de Leghton, Deforciant, of a messuage and one acre of land in Leghton, whereof was Plea of Convention. Richard acknowledged the premises (which I presume were glebe), together -with the Ad vowson of Leghton Church, to be the Bishop's, \u2014 to hold to the Bishop and his heirs, under Richard and his heirs for ever at a clove rent. For this the Bishop is said to have given a sore sparrow hawk. We know that Bishop Burnel forthwith conveyed the above premises and Advowson to Buildwas Abbey. We have also seen how the Monks propitiated or rewarded their Benefactor.20 As re gards their recent acquisition they of course took immediate steps to obtain permission to appropriate the Rectory of Leighton, and we know that they were successful. In prospect of such success, and with reference to the territorial interests which they would have in Leighton, as appropriators of the glebe-land, the Monks seem to have had some negotiation with Sir Richard de Leighton. By one agreement, dated in 12 Edward I. (1283-4), Sir Richard covenants that, in case the Monks \" shall possess the Church of Leighton in proprios usus,\" they shaU keep a certain quantity of stock in the common pastures of Leighton, over and above what they were al ready entitled to keep under grant of Sir William, father of Sir Richard. Sir Richard further commutes his present hay- tithes for a plot of meadow in Addeley, to be conveyed to the Monks ; and in lieu of certain plots already given in commutation of other hay-tithes, Sir Richard undertakes to measure, and convey to the Monks, a plot of equal extent, before Christmas 1284. In lieu of houseboot and hayboot Sir Richard will give the Monks a small meadow of 2s. annual value, besides a certain quantity of fuel under view of his Forester.

Both parties bound themselves in \u00a340. to the Church of Lichfield to fulfil the above agreement as soon as practicable.21 Another, and probably earlier agreement,22 is without date, and a little less definite than the above, but contains nothing worth re citing. I must however give at length, a Deed which I conceive to be Sir Richard de Leighton's fulfilment of a part of his undertakings, \u2014 a supposition which as regards date is quite consistent with the known \u00e6ra of the attesting witnesses. \u2014 31 Supra, Vol. VI. p. 326. 21 \u25a0 - Dukes's Antiquities, pp. lxvi, lxvii."], [377, "333 LEIGHTON. \" Sciant, etc., quod ego Ricardus dominus de Leghton, pro amore Dei, etc., dedi, etc., Abbati et Conventui de Buldewas et eorum suc cessoribus quandam placeam terr\u00e6 me\u00e6 in territorio de Leghton, cum pertinentiis suis ; illam videlicet qu\u00e6 vocatur Moseruding, et jacet inter terram meam ex una parte et pratum dictorum Abbatis et Conventus ex altera, sicut rubis et una haia circumquaque includitur; habendam etc. in liberam, puram, et perpetuam elemosynam, etc. Hiis testibus, \u2014 Domino Adam de Lacy, Hugone domino de Scheyn tone, Waltero de Dreytone, Henrico de Garmundestone, Willielmo Peyn de Leghtone, Willielmo Brun de eadem.\"23 The Feodary of 1284 says that \" Richard de Lechton holds the vills of Lechton and Garmonston under Richard fitz Alan, who holds of the King in capite.\" A somewhat later Feodary expresses Richard de Leighton's service to be that of a knight's-fee, and adds that his estate in Leighton and Garmston was geldable. Again at this point of the Leighton genealogy, I am uncertain as to the time when Richard de Leighton (IV.) was succeeded by a Son of the same name. A Sir Richard de Leighton occurs, either with the express title of Knight, or in the position of a Knight, under the following dates, viz. on a Jury of December 1285, in a testing-clause of 1286, as a Knight in August 1290, and as a Witness in March 1294. Again we have a Richard de Leighton, apparently a Knight, at testing a Buildwas Deed in May 1303, and sitting as Foreman of a Jury at Wellington in March 1304. This person I shall call \u2014 Richard de Leighton (V.), and proceed to say what is further known of him. By some means or other he came into collision with the Consistory Court of the Diocese, and having been repeatedly pronounced contumacious by Bishop Langton's Commissary in the said Court, was at last excommunicated. On January 12, 1310, the Bishop absolves Sir Richard de Leghton, Knight, from this sen tence, but enjoins that under a penalty of 40 merks he shall, before Michaelmas next ensuing, journey to Rome, and there offer 12 pounds of wax-candles in the Church of St. Peter, and make a like oblation in the Church of St. Paul.24 I presume that the Knight preferred the penalty to the journey, but of this we have no evidence. His employments and trusts at home were as follows. \u2014 Durin\"* the reign of Edward IL, he was returned as a Knight of the Shire for Salop, to five Parliaments, viz. three in 1313, one in 53 Rot.

In four instances we have evidence of his attendance, and in the last case his Manucaptors were Roger de Leighton and William de Leighton (of Eaton Constantine). In 1308, and 1316, Sir Richard de Leighton acted as a Commissioner of array, and for raising levies in Shropshire.25 In the Feodary of March 1316, he is returned as Lord of the Vill of Leighton, and in May 1324 he was summoned from the County of Salop to attend a Great CouncU at Westminster.26 I must conclude my account of this family with showing the mode in which this Richard de Leighton settled his estate. The Deed, of which I give an abstract, passed on July 13, 1315, and must be taken as a feoffment-in-trust. \u2014 \" Ricardus Dominus de Leghton, Miles, dedi, etc., Willielmo filio Ricardi Pride de Salop, pro quadam summa quam dedit, etc., totum manerium meum de Leghton cum dominio ejusdem manerii. \u2014 Habendum et tenendum cum wardis Releviis, Escaetis, homagiis, fidelitatibus, sectis, serviciis, boscis, moris, etc., dicto Willielmo et heredibus et assignatis, de capitalibus dominis inperpetuum sine retinemento mei, etc. Hiis testibus, \u2014 Dominis Ricardo de Har legh, et Willielmo de Lodelawe, Militibus; Rogerio de Cheney, Hugone de Sheynton, Rogerio de Mokeleye, Hugone de Besselowe, Johanne Rondulf, et aliis.

The Fine purports to be levied between Richard de Leghton and his wife Agnes, Plaintiffs (William son of Richard de la Fountain of Upton being put in Agnes's place by Writ Royal), and William son of Richard Pride of Salop, Defor ciant, of the Manor of Leghton, etc., whereof was Plea of Convention.

On Walter's death without such heirs, there are further remainders to John, brother of Walter, and to William son of Richard de Leghton. As it is impossible to draw a Pedigree from any Fine couched in such technical language as the above, I wiU not discuss how this en tail took effect. \u2014 I will merely state that on April 10, 1347, John de Leighton appears as .Lord of Leighton, and that he had a brother, another John, and a Sister Agnes, tenants in the Manor.28 Among the Undertenants in Leighton I must mention several who wUl occur to us elsewhere in higher positions. Among others, the Woodcotes, who were Lords of the adjoining Manor of Eye, held Leighton-Mill under the Lords of Leighton, and, as it would seem, had their own Undertenants at the said Mill. At the Assizes of November 1221, Lecia, widow of Damian de Lecton, sued Robert de Wodecot for a third of Leighton Mill, which she claimed as her dower. Robert de Wodecot called Richard de Lecton to warranty ; \u2014 who was present, but claimed to have reasonable notice before he could appear in warranty. The cause was adjourned till January 14, when also it was to be shown what interest MiUsent, widow of Robert de Wodecot, the present Plaintiff's Father, had in the Mill ; for the said Milisent, although summoned by the Plaintiff for the present hearing, was not forthcoming. Lucia had named her son Philip, or else Geoffrey de Dunnoc, as her Attorney, when Robert de Wodecot reappeared in Court and surrendered what was claimed.29 The Fine which ensued is preserved. \u2014 Robert de Wudecot concedes the said third of Lecton-Mill to Lucia for life, to hold under him self and his heirs, at a rent of 2s. 1 \\d.

LEIGHTON CHURCH. This may be looked upon as a Saxon Foundation, although the Parish of Leighton must at any time have been far short of the usual Saxon dimensions. It seems in fact to have been surrounded on all sides by the greater Saxon Parishes of Cound and Wroxeter. Nevertheless, Leighton Church can be shown to have had one affiliation, viz. the Chapel of Eaton Constantine. The right of Burial which Leighton has always maintained over the latter Parish, is an infallible proof that it was originally the Mother Church. With this view Domesday is in perfect harmony, for the Priest, who is registered under Lestone, was doubtless the Rector of the pre-existent Church. We have seen how the Advowson of Leighton was conveyed in 1282 by Richard de Leighton to Robert Burnell, Bishop of Bath and Wells, and how within two years that Prelate conferred it on 33 Cum necesse fuerit dijudicio reddendo per afforciamentum Curi\u0153.

The Bishop's Charter in this matter is not, as far as I can learn, extant ; but a synopsis of benefactions to their House, drawn up by the Monks of Buildwas, recorded the gift in the following terms. \u2014 Episcopus Bathon' dedit Abbati et Conventui de Buldewas unum messuagium, et acram terr\u00e6 in Leghton et advo cacionem Ecclesi\u00e6 de Leghton?6 A Patent of King Edward I., dated in 1285-6, seems to have sanctioned this grant to BuUdwas ; and I find it stated that Bishop Langton ordained the Vicarage of Leighton (that is, assigned the portion of the future Vicars) in 1288.37 In a former Volume I stated the great difficulty which I anti cipated in accounting for the pension of 5s. which the Vicars of Leighton used to pay to the Church of Holgate.38 I now have little hesitation in suggesting that this impost was laid upon the Church of Leighton by Robert Burnell (Lord of Holgate) during the short period in which he was Patron of Leighton. The Taxation of 1291 gives the Church of Lehton, in the Arch deaconry and Deanery of Salop, as worth \u00a34. per annum?9 In 1 341 the Assessors of the Ninth call the Church of Leghton a Chapel, and reduce the Taxation of \u00a34. to an assessment of \u00a31. 13s. 4d. Two carucates of land which were Roger le Taillour's, and two vir gates besides, lay unfilled. Moreover, the Glebe and other income of the said Chapel was, in the current year, hardly as much as two merks.40 The Valor of 1534-5 gives \u00a38, as the income of John Barnys, Vicar of Leighton. The Rector of Holgate's pension of 5s. (already alluded to) was the only charge on the Vicarage.41 At the same time the Abbot of Buildwas was in receipt of \u00a34. per annum for the ferm of the (Rectorial) tithes of Leighton.43 Out of this income the Abbot paid 6s. 8d. for procurations to the Archdeacon of Salop.43 EARLY INCUMBENTS.

Tradition says that the Monument, of which an Engraving is annexed, was brought hither from BuUdwas Abbey at the Dis solution, and that it is the monument of a Leighton. So far tra dition is entitled to impUcit faith. The next question is, to which of the seven first Lords of Leighton, of whom we have authentic accounts, shall the Monument be assigned ? Tradition, with a less definite voice, speaks of a Sir Richard de Leighton. Such was its dictum at least in the year 1814. 44 We have seen that the Seal used by Sir Richard de Leighton (V.), in 1315, had the usual Leighton Arms, differenced by a Bendlet.45 The same Shield is observable on the Monument under notice. As to the costume of the Effigy, that again is consistent with the \u00e6ra of Richard de Leighton (V.).46 His social eminence, and his transactions with Buildwas Abbey, make it quite supposable that he was buried there; though I think it possible that some of his ancestors may have been also buried at Buildwas, \u2014 in fact, that the Abbey Church was the ordinary burial-place of the family. afterwards %tt Cutttta^ NOW LEE-GOMERY.

There are two leagues of Wood. In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 20s. (yearly); now it is worth 15s.\"1 I have already observed that nothing which Toret the Saxon held, at or before Domesday , can be proved to have remained in his family, or to have descended to his heirs, the Corbets of Moreton. In this respect the history of Lega is in keeping with aU analogy ; for the Corbets of Moreton never inherited any interest in Lee- Cumbray. In another respect the descent of this Manor is almost exceptional ; for, though it belonged at Domesday to the Fief of Rainald Vicecomes, it did not afterwards belong to the Fief of Rainald's ordinary successors, the Fitz Alans. Lega and, with it, Rainald's Manor of Little Dawley, were lost to the Domesday Fief of which they formed a part ; but when this happened, or how, we know not. An exchange, a surrender, or an insufficiency of title, are more probable causes of the change than any forfeiture; but the change, however caused, took place during that dark period of Shropshire History, of which we have neither Record nor Tradition. Suffice it then to say that within fifty years after Domesday, Lega and Little Dawley had reverted to the Suzerain, whether Earl Pala tine or King, and were thenceforth held in capite as one Manor, by a famUy which had no known connection with Rainald Vicecomes, or with Fitz Alan. The House of De Cambray was clearly of Norman origin, but without attempting to trace it to its remoter sources I shall content myself with saying that it was established in Cheshire at least as early as the reign of Henry II. Thus \u2014 Alured de Cambrai stands first witness of a Charter which Hugh Cyvelioc, Earl of Chester, expedited, between 1155 and 1180, to Shrewsbury Abbey.3 And this Alured we know to have been Lord of Lce-Cumbray; for in the year 1167, when Alan de Nevill, Justice of the Forest, set an amercement of 10 merks on this Manor, it is described on the Pipe-Roll as Alured's Lee (Lega Aluredi). Again the Forest- Roll of 1180 records a fine of 2s. against Alured de Cumbrai for waste in Dalilea ; \u2014 that is, in Little Domesday, so. 254, b, 2. | 2 Salop Chartulary, No. 315."], [387, "341 LEE CUMBRAY, NOW LEE GOMERY. Dawley. The same person is assessed 7s. for imbladements in Legh, viz. 4 acres of wheat and 16 acres of oats. Also one Alured is assessed 12c?. for pourpresture in Ketel, which I take to be Ketley. The successor, probably the son, of Alured de Cambrai was \u2014 John de Cambrai. Between the years 1187 and 1197 John de Cumbrey, for the souls' -health of himself, his father, mother, pre decessors, and heirs, gave to Wombridge Priory a virgate of land in Wethmundeshall (Wappenshall) , with 8 acres and an adjacent meadow in addition.

He left a son Roger, an infant under ten years of age. His Widow, Alina, soon became the wife of Robert de Hamarz. Lee Cumbray, as being a tenure -in-capite, naturaUy appears as an escheat at this juncture. Hence we find on the Pipe-RoU of 1199 that the Villate of Lega had been assessed 40s. to a King's Tallage. At Michaelmas 1200 the Sheriff of Shropshire accounts at the Exchequer for 100s., being the year's proceeds of the land of Lega qu\u00e6 suit Johannis de Cumbrai. The same thing is repeated at Michaelmas 1201, but at Michaelmas 1202, the Sheriff pays 50s. for one half-year, and owes 50s. for another half-year. This item of account does not recur on succeeding Rolls, but why, I cannot say. Meantime, I find these notices of John de Cambrai's Widow. She had, it seems, either as dower or inheritance, a moiety of the Staffordshire Manor of Warslaw. Being Widow of a Tenant-in capite, her estates and remarriage were a subject of presentment at the Lichfield Assizes of September 1199 and September 1203. On the first occasion the Jurors of Totmanslow Hundred reported how the \" wife (widow) of John de Cumbray was holding a moiety of Werfelawe in that Hundred, which moiety was worth 29s. 3d. per annum.\"i The Report of 1203 (as printed) is that \"Alina, widow of John de Pumerai, was of the King's gift (as to remarriage), and was married to Robert de Hamarz, the Jurors know not by whose authority.\"5 An Inquiry in the County of Salop was ordered to be made. 3 Wombridge Chartulary, Tit.

At the Forest Assizes of March 1209, one Robert de Cwnbrais is assessed under Regard of Mount Gilbert. I cannot help thinking that this was Robert de Hamarz, though Robert de Lee Cumbrais would have been a more distinct description of the person who doubtless was holding a third of the said Manor at the period. Roger de Cumbrai, son and heir of John de Cumbrai, was still an infant in 1212. In that year \"Baldwin de Hodnet fined 40 merks and one good palfrey to have custody of the land of Roger de Cumbrai, son of John de Cumbrai, together with the marriage of the said Roger.\" The money had been paid, but the palfrey was owing.6 Roger de Cumbrai must have died without issue very shortly after this ; otherwise the marriage and land of \u2014 Agnes de Cumbray would not have appeared in the market of such commodities. It seems that John fitz Philip (of Bobbington, I presume,) fined 20 merks for this marriage ; but he had it not, for a Writ of King John, dated August 4, 1215, orders the Barons of the Exchequer to cancel the Fine and to acquit John fitz Philip of all liability in respect thereof.7 I cannot suppose that Agnes de Cumbray and Petronilla de Cumbray (presently to be mentioned) were the only or the principal claimants of Roger de Cumbray's estates. Nor do I think that they were his Sisters, far less his daughters. The Cumbray estates seem to me to have been divided among coheirs, remotely coUateral, and the share of the principal claimant, Thomas Tuschet, to have devolved on him from his mother or some more remote ancestor ; but certainly not to have accrued to him in right of any wife. By what means soever \u2014 Thomas Tuschet became Lord of Lee Cumbray before 1221, but not, as it seems, without some dispute. The Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 1218 tells us how Petronilla de Cumbry had fined 30 merks \"to have her reasonable part of the lands which had been Alured de Cumbry's,\" and how the debt had by Writ- Royal been made a pre sent to the Earl of Chester (then Sheriff of Shropshire) . I suppose that Petronilla got her share of the Cumbray estates generally, but Lee Cumbray remained ostensibly with Thomas Tuschet, except so much thereof as still formed the dower of Alina, wife of Robert de Hamarz. At the Assizes of November 1221, Robert de Hamet and his wife Alina sued Thomas Tuschet for disseizing them of their tenement in Lega. The Defendant appeared not, and could not be found. The Jury decided that he had disseized the Plaintiffs of a certain bosc, whereof one-third was of Alina's dower. So he was r' Rot.

About this time, that is, between the years 1215 and 1224, Thomas Tuschet gave to Wombridge Priory all his share of the common wood of Wombridge, which was common between himself and John le Strange. Stamforde in Watbngestrete, Riehe lin, Sprungwellsich, and Watlingestrete, are named as boundaries of the grant, which was attested by Baldwin de Hodnet, William de Ercalew, Hugh fitz Robert, Robert fitz Aher, Philip Parson of Wel lington, Robert de Hammas, Robert de Broctou, and John Walsh.9 On January 2, 1235, Thomas Thushet being dead, the King re ceived the homage of \u2014 Henry Thushet, his son and heir, who had fined 100s. for his Relief for the ViU of Lee Cumbray, which was held in capite by Serjeantry.10 On November 20, 1242, Henry Tuschet was deceased, and his brother and heir\u2014 Robert Tuschet fined 10 merks for relief of all his lands. He had already done fealty for the same, and was to do homage on the King's return to England.11 John le Strange, Justice of Chester, was ordered to give Robert Tuschet seizin of all such lands as were in his baiUwick, saving the dower of Henry Tuschet's widow, Emma. Robert Tuschet died in the month of October 1248, but the King's Writ of Diem clausit did not issue till August 23, 1249. In the interval, Ysambel, Robert Tuschet's Mother, died, seized in dower of 2\\ virgates in Lee Cumbray.12 One Inquest stated this fact, and that Robert Tuschet's tenure was two-thirds of a carucate held in demesne, and four virgates held in Villainage, and two-thirds of a messuage, garden, and mill ; \u2014 the whole worth \u00a32. 15s. 4\\d. per annum.

One of these last Inquests valued Robert Tuschet's interest in Leg-Cumbre at \u00a35. 17s. 4c.., or at least stated that that revenue was already in manu Regis, but that three Ladies (domin\u0153) were portioned (dotantur) in the same fee, and a certain chUd (puer), Lee Cumbray was only dower. Neither is it supposable that she was the second of two wives, the first of whom was such a coheiress ; for then Robert Tuschet, not being the son of such supposed first wife, could not have inherited Lee Cumbray. 8 Assizes, 6 Hen.

Again, it was stated that a boy of five years of age was Robert Tuschet's heir, and that the said heir had about five merks revenue in Tatenhal in the County of Cheshire, subject to the dower of a certain dowager.13 I cannot altogether explain these Inquests. It is impossible to conclude that the three Domin\u00e6 were surviving Widows of three Lords of Lee Cumbray, and yet I have no direct evidence to show that the Manor was still held in coparcenary, or that more than one of John de Cumbray' s coheirs was represented there. One of the three Domin\u00e6 was, I think, Emma, widow of Henry Tuschet, and I shall show a probability that she carried her dower in Lee Cumbray to her second husband, Griffin de Bromfield. She was a daughter of Henry de Audley, and had several children by her second husband. By a Patent of August 4, 1251, King Henry III. gives custody of certain lands in Lee Cumbray and in Tatehal (Cheshire) to John Maunsell, \" which lands the King had found by Inquisition to belong to the heirs of Robert Tuschet, of which heirs John MaunseU had the custody.\" We have heard of John Mansel be fore,14 and can easily account for his obtaining this or any other wardship in Shropshire. The Bradford Hundred- Roll of 1255 says as follows. \u2014 \" John Mansel holds the vill of Lega Cumbray in ward, of the fee of Robert Thochet ; and it is mi hides with its appurtenances ; and it pays 16d. per annum for stretward, and 16d. for motfee. Ralph de Lega does suit to County and Hundred, hereditarily, for the Manor of Lega. Robert Thuchet, Lord of the said ViU, holds (read held) it, in capite of the King, by service of one muntorius, in war against Wales, for forty days, at his own cost, and according to the King's pleasure, as regards the time or place of invasion.\" The Muntorius was, it seems, to be armed \" with a hauberk, a chapel de fer, and a lance.\" \"The said land was worth 100s. per annum.\"15 I have here to observe that the four hides thus attributed to Lee Cumbray, clearly consisted of its own three Domesday hides, and the single hide which Domesday had aUotted to Dalelie (Little Dawley) : the latter being now reputed a mere member of Lee Cumbray. A King's Writ, dated March 9, 1258, certifies that Griffin de 13 Inquisitions, 33 Hen. III., No. 54. 15 Rot. Hundred. II. 57. 14 Supra, Vol. I. p. 339."], [391, "345 LEE CUMBRAY, NOW LEE GOMEItY. Brumfeld had renounced his fealty to the King, and orders that \" Leyes Cumbray (which Griffin held as dower of his wife, and of the inheritance of Henry Thuchet's heir, which heir was under age and in custody of John Mansell, Treasurer of York)\" should be extended or valued.16 Notwithstanding the general terms of this Writ, it is evident that all which the Prince of Powis Vadoc held or forfeited in Lee Cumbray was his wife's dower. It is time now to give some account of the Minor so often alluded to. Calling him \u2014 Thomas Tuschet (IL), I proceed to observe that he can hardly have attained his majority before the year 1265, when his Guar dian, John Mansel, was already deceased. A Grant of Free Warren however had been allowed as early as the year 1252, to Thomas son of Robert Tuschet in respect of the Manor of Markenton (Markeaton in Derbyshire).17 There is no doubt that this Tho mas was the Minor of whom I am speaking, and I suppose it was the great influence of his Guardian which procured so unusual a favour. About the year 1269, Thomas Tuschet expedited two Charters to Wombridge Priory.18 Styling himself \" Thomas Tuschet, son and heir of Robert Tuschet,\" he concedes to the Canons free in gress and egress in his bosc of Ketley, with their carriages, carts, and work-people, to hew and get stone in his quarry there, and to convey it away for their buUdings and repairs, whenever neces sary. The grant was for the souls' -health of himself, his ancestors, and successors, and on condition that the Canons should yearly on the day of St. Valentine the Martyr (Feb. 14) perform solemn ser vices for the souls of Robert, the Grantor's father, of Sir John MaunseU, and for the souls of the Grantor and his wife Margery, whenever they should depart this life, and for the souls of the Grantor's children, etc. Witnesses, \u2014 Sirs John de Ercalewe, John fitz Aer, John fitz Hugh, and Walter de Pedewardin, Knights ; Robert de Stanton, John de Stewynton, Herbert de Wyke, and Michael de Moreton.

It was but a counterpart of Walter de Dunstanvill's Deed already alluded to : 19 that is, he gives to the Canons all his share of a wood which was in dispute (in calengio) between Dun stanviU and himself.

It very properly names Ketley as a member of Lee Cumbray, and gives Thomas Tuchet's service as a Serjeantry, viz. \" to provide a man at his own cost, to proceed (with the King's host) for 40 days in time of war.\" In January 1287 Thomas Tuchet was appointed one of the Con servators of the Peace in the County of Derby. At the Assizes of 1292, the Bradford Jurors, under the title De Serjanciis, gave ac count of Thomas Thochet's tenure of Leye Cumbrey, and valued the Manor at \u00a315. per annum. Hugh de Louther, the King's Attor ney, alleged that the services due from the Manor were in arrear for two campaigns in Wales, viz. those of 1277 and 1282. Thomas Tochet appeared in Court, and showed that he had compounded for his service in 1277 by a Fine of 10 merks ; but not being able to say anything as regarded the campaign of 1282, the Court ordered his Serjeantry to be seized in manu Regis, but he fined 40s. to retain it till the next Parliament, Roger son of Thomas de Pulesdon and Master Richard de Pulesdon being his securities.20 Among those who were summoned to muster at Londou for Foreign service, on July 7, 1297, Thomas Tochet was one. His liability arose from his holding lands, of \u00a320. annual value or upwards, in the Counties of Derbyshire and Shropshire. Again, he was summoned to a Military Council, to be holden at London by Prince Edward on Oct. 6, 1297; and again, to attend muster at Berwick upon Tweed on June 24, 1301, prepared for military service against the Scots.31 This last summons alludes to his lands in Rutlandshire as well as Derbyshire. In 1299 Thomas Tuchett obtained a Charter of Free- Warren in his Cheshire Ma nors of Tatenhale (Tattenhall) and Lauton (Bug Lawton).22 In 1314 Thomas Tuchet was twice put in commission as a Justice of oyer and terminer and of gaol delivery for Lincolnshire, and had also military summons against the Scots, returnable at Berwick upon-Tweed on June 30th of that year.

His tenure of Aswelle (Rutlandshire) was by service of one-third of a knight's-fee. The Manor was held of that part of the Honour of Chester which having fallen to the pourparty of Robert Bruce was now an Escheat of the English King.24 A Derbyshire Inquest likewise describes his interest in Mark-eton, but I may refer to an earlier Record on that point, and state that that Manor had been held by his ances tors of the Honour of Chester, and by service of 1\u00a7 knight's-fees.25 The Rutlandshire Inquest states the age of Robert son and heir of Thomas Tuchet to be 40 years ; the Shropshire Inquest with more probable accuracy states the heir to have been 50 years of age on December 25, 1314. Robert Tuchet (II.) appears in the Nomina Villarum of March 1316, as Lord of the Vills of Ashwell and Teigh in Rutlandshire, aud of Lee Mumbray, in Shropshire.26 In the same year he was summoned to be at Newcastle upon Tyne on October 6, for military service against the Scots. A similar summons returnable at New castle on July 24, 1322, was served by the Sheriff of Rutlandshire at the Manor House of \" Sir Robert Tuschet, Lord of Assewell,\" but the Knight was absent from home. In 1324 he appears as Custos of certain escheated lands in Derbyshire. The same year he was summoned both in Derbyshire and Rutlandshire to attend a great Council at Westminster on May 30th.26 This Robert Tuchet is said to have been succeeded by a son and heir, Thomas ; and I quite concur in the statement, though Dugdale has erroneously attributed to \u2014 Thomas Tuchet (III.) those grants to Wombridge Priory which were made by his Grandfather. In 1342 Thomas Tuchet was en deavouring to obtain view of frank pledge at Marketon Harneys, Derbyshire.27 He died in 1349 seized apparently of Leghe Cum bray, and leaving a son and heir, \u2014 John Tuchet, then 22 years of age, and already distinguished in the Wars of France.

From them the existent Barony of Audley is derived through an unbroken descent. Thus in tracing out the history of a Shropshire Manor I have been fortuitously enabled to add something and correct much which had been previously forgotten or misapprehended by Writers of Baronial History.29 Of Undertenants in Lee Cumbray, we have Ralph de Lega, already noticed in 1255, and Robert de Leg Cumbray, a Juror on a Bradford Inquest in May 1264. The latter is he, I think, who is empaneUed as Robert de Lega in a Wellington Inquest of September 1279, but who appears again as Robert de Leycombre in February 1283. Wappenshall. This member of Lee Cumbray is variously written in ancient documents as Whatmundeshal, Quatmundeshale or Quap pynsall. The earliest notice which I have of it is in a Fine of May 31, 1228. Thereby John le Reve and Cecily his wife, Plaintiffs in a suit of Grand- Assize, quit-claim for themselves and the heirs of Cecily a virgate of land in Whatmundeshal to Stephen de What mundeshal (Tenant), who pays one merk for the recognition.

There was at Malins Lee \u2014 A Norman Chapel, of which some remains stiU exist. This is not likely to have been founded by the Lords of Lee Cumbray, who 19 Compare Dugdale's Baronage, Vol. II. p. 28 ; and Collins's Peerage (ed. 1779), Vol. VI. p. 301."], [395, "I RUINED CHAPEL, MAI.INS LEE"], [396, ""], [397, "349 LITTLE DAWLEY. would have selected a site nearer to Lee Cumbray itself. At the same time it is clear that the Chapel must have been founded by a Layman, and if so, by some Feoffee of the Manorial Lords. Of course no notice of such a Chapel is to be expected in Ecclesiastical Records or Diocesan Registers. Both the Church of Great Dawley and the Chapel of Malins Lee were originally founded in the Parish, and subject to the Church, of Idsall ; but when Dawley became an independent Parish, Malins Lee was involved in the change, and losing aU connection with the Mother-Church was rather associated with the daughter. kittle Batolep, I have said that Domesday treats of Little Dawley as an indepen dent Manor, but that in later Records it appears as a mere member of Lee Cumbray. The Domesday notice runs as follows. \u2014 \" The same Rainald (Vicecomes) holds Dalelie, and Benedict (holds it) of him. Sistain held it (in Saxon times) . Here is one hide. In de mesne there is half an ox-team, and (there are) i Serf, i Villain, and ii Boors with half a team ; and there might be two additional teams. There is one league of wood, which the Earl holds in demesne. In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 24s. (per annum) ; now it is worth 5s.\"1 It is just worth remarking that the above-named Benedict appears in Domesday as holding the Staffordshire Manor of Morton, imme diately under Earl Roger de Montgomery;2 and that whereas Rainald Vicecomes or his Successors, the Fitz Alans, lost the Seigneury of Little Dawley, they gained the Seigneury of Morton, which, except in Domesday, always appears as a member of the Barony of Os westry. This circumstance induces a suspicion that whatever was taken from the Fief of the Sheriff, as in the cases of Lee Cumbray and Little Dawley, was replaced elsewhere. After insisting so often on what I may caU the permanent in tegrity of the Sheriff's Fief, as transmitted to Fitz Alan, it is satis factory to find that one of the few exceptions to that theory rather i \u2022 2 Domesday, fos. 254, b, 2 ; 248, a, 1."], [398, "rainald's anonymous manor. 350 strengthens it than otherwise. I now pass to another of these ex ceptions, about which I have nothing so satisfactory to suggest. \u2014 fcatnato's ananpmuus JHanor, Between the Domesday notices of Dalelie (Little Dawley) and Lega (Lee Cumbray) stands the following entry. \u2014 \" The same Rainald (Vicecomes) holds, of the Earl, two hides and two parts of one hide, for a Manor. Wige held it in King Edward's time. Richard holds it of Rainald, and has one ox-team in demesne, and two Serfs and three ViUains, with two teams. Out of this land, one free-man (francus homo) holds half a hide and two parts of a virgate ; and together with his three Boors, has six oxen ploughing thereon. In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 25s. (per annum) . Now it is worth 20s. There might be a team and half (additional) here.\" 1 My attempts to identify this nameless Manor with any Manor of later notoriety have been vain. No estate in Recordine Hundred, corresponding with the above in hidage or any other circumstance, can be traced down to Fitz Alan ; nor does any Recordine Manor of Fitz Alan appear subsequently with any such increased hidage as to warrant a suggestion that it had absorbed the Manor unnamed. I may go even further than this, and state summarily that of all the later Manors of Recordine Hundred, whether held by Fitz Alan or others, there is not one, which cannot be traced to its Domesday antecedent. We have then to account for the destination of a Manor, unquestionably lost or suppressed, after Domesday. \u2014 Judging from position in the Record we should expect to find the territory, which then constituted this anonymous Manor, in the neighbourhood of Little Dawley or Leegomery. The surrender or loss of all three Manors, by Rainald or his Successors, makes it still more supposable that they were in the same district. Again, Wige, the Saxon Owner of the nameless Manor, was also a Co parcener in Eyton (on the Wealdmoors) ; \u2014 a fact which leads to a similar conclusion as to the situation of the lost Manor. Now we have seen under Little Dawley, that though that Manor 1 Domesday, so. 254, b, 2."], [399, "rainald's anonymous manor. 351 had been annexed before Domesday to the Fief of the Sheriff, Earl Roger retained a league of wood there, in the Palatine Demesne. This league of wood I take to have been the nucleus of a Palatine or Royal Forest, formed subsequently to Domesday ; and I think it very possible that the Sheriff (whether Rainald or one of his Suc cessors) surrendered his Manors in this quarter in aid of such a pro ject. Leegomery and Little Dawley, as we have seen, eventually regained their Manorial status, but regained it in a form different from that of which Domesday informs us ; that is the Domesday Seigneury vanished in both, and they became a combined Manor, held in capite by a tenure newer than, and quite irrelevant to, that of Domesday. But I repeat that there is no symptom of Rainald's unnamed Manor having been reproduced in any manorial shape whatever. Surely then it remained absorbed in the Palatine or Royal Forests : and this conclusion wiU become more plausible, when we consider that one principal department of the Forest of the Wrekin, lay in the exact situation where we should expect to find the anonymous Manor now in question. In the following pages I shall frequently have to speak of the Forest of Wombridge. It was not disforested till the year 1300. Its jurisdiction, though it was only a member of the Wrekin-Forest, was compact in itself. We have seen how two named Manors of Domesday (Womerton and Netley) became depopulated and absorbed by The Forest.2 I see no alternative but to conclude that Rainald's Manor, Ul-distinguished in Domesday, soon vanished utterly in the obscurities of Wombridge Forest. As to Ricardus, Rainald's Tenant at Domesday, in this anonymous Manor, I have suggested under Preston-Boats, that he was Ancestor of the Stantons of Stanton Hineheath, etc. I have also shown that before the death of Henry I. great additions were made to the Domes day Fief of Ricardus, that is, he or his successors, the Stantons, were holding five estates under Fitz Alan, in which he had no con cern at Domesday? It is quite consistent with, and rather auxiliary to, my former arguments, if we suppose that what Ricardus lost by the afforestation of the Manor now under notice was made up to him elsewhere. 3 Vide supra, p. 268. 2 Supra, Vol. VI. pp. 158, 298."], [400, "352 irntiiep* Domesday describes this Manor as follows. \u2014 \" The same Rainald holds Hatlege, and Goisfrid (holds it) of him.

In demesne there is one ox-team, and n Serfs and vni Boors with half a team, and yet there might be two and a half teams additional here. Here is a Mill of 2s. (annual value), and a league of wood. In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 37s. (per annum); now it is worth 15s. He (Rainald) found it waste.\"1 Goisfrid's connection with Hadley is established by further evi dence than the above. Within ten years after Domesday he gave half a hide in Hadley to Shrewsbury Abbey. Various Confirma tions to that House speak of the grant ; \u2014 for instance, Earl Roger's Confirmation says, \u2014 Goiffridus (dedit) dimidiam hidam in Herlega : the Charter of King William II. says, \u2014 Goffridus (dedit) dimidiam hidam in Herleia; and that of King Henry I. says, \u2014 Goisfridus (dedit) dimidiam hidam in villa qu\u00e6 dicitur Herleia. King Ste phen's Confirmation speaks the same language, but King Henry II.'s is more accurate than any, when it confirms, ex dono Gaufridi, di midiam hidam in Hetlega. Notwithstanding this cumulative proof as to the identity of the Grantor and the locality of the Grant, it is pretty certain that the Grantees eventuaUy retained nothing in Hadley except the tithes, and these, I think, accrued to them as Impropriators of the Church of Wellington. Returning to Gois frid it is quite clear that before the end of Henry I.'s reign he was succeeded in his tenure of this Manor by one whom I can hardly think to have been his sou. This was \u2014 William de Hadley (I.), who, by his marriage with Seburga, daughter of Hamo Peverel, acquired a position for himself and his descendants, which the genealogical obscurities of the twelfth cen tury have affected but little. There are two Charters by Hamo Peverel to Shrewsbuiy Abbey, which passed towards the close of Henry I.'s reign, i. e. about the year 1134. Both these Charters are attested by WiUiam de Hedlega and his sons Alan and William.2 A later Grant of Hamo Peverel to the same Abbey passed immediately aftqr Stephen's accession to 1 Domesday, so. 254, b, 2.

It is attested by Alan son of William de Hedlega.3 * The Wombridge Chartulary contains a curious grant by Hamo Peverel to his daughter Seburga, which, though it belongs more properly to WeUington, I prefer to recite here. \u2014 \" Hamo Paperellus heredi suo et omnibus amicis suis etc. tam Angligenis quam Francigenis salutem. Notum sit, etc. me dedisse Seburg\u00e6 fili\u00e6me\u00e6 quendam f rondel lum* in Waletonia, scilicet fron dellum Siwardi cum hominio ejus, in feodo et hereditate, etc. Tes tibus Ranulfo Abbate de Salopesbia, Roberto fratre suo, Radulfo filio Tealdi, Roberto filio Nigelli, Roberto de Meleburn et multis aliis.\"5 Now it is quite certain that this Deed passed between the years 1137 and 1141, for Ranulph did not succeed to the Abbacy of Shrewsbury till 1137, or after, and Hamo Peverel was dead in 1141. I think too that at the time of this Deed, William de Hadley (I.) must have been dead, and Seburga the Grantee, a widow, otherwise her husband would have been named. I further think that, when, about the year 1136, Alan son of William de Hadley, attested Hamo Peverel's grant to Shrewsbury, the said Alan had already succeeded to his father. It is important thus to ascertain the date of the first William de Hadley's death, for we are thereby enabled to fix proxi mately the period when Wombridge Priory was founded. Whatever has been said to the contrary, the said William, with Seburga his wife, and Alan their son, were the joint Founders of that House, and William fitz Alan, the reputed Founder, had nothing more to do with the matter than, as Seigneural Lord, to confirm the acts of his Tenants. The site of the future Priory was in Hadley Wood. It was bounded on one side by a rivulet, which divided the said wood from the King's adjacent Forest ; on another side, by a rivulet called Sprungewella-broc ; on a third side, by Watlingstreet. The Priory was founded for Augustine Canons, and if, as I suppose, to wards the close of Henry I.'s reign, it was very nearly cotemporary with William fitz Alan's similar Foundation at Haughmond. Be fore I close my notice of William de Hadley (I.), I should observe that his wife, Seburga, the daughter of Hamo Peverel, was to all appearance illegitimate, and that she survived him at least 20 years. There is a curious but authentic story of something which happened to this Lady in her old-age. Henry II. had been restored to the 3 Monasticon, III. 519, b. I onymous.

The King took up his quarters at Ayldulveston, \u2014 now known as Arleston, a town ship of Wellington. Seburga is (not I think inaccurately) described in this instance as Domina de Hedlegh, which means, I think, that, having Hadley wholly as her own, and not partly as in dower, she was still resident there. She sent King Henry a present, to his lodgings at Arleston, and followed up the compliment by a personal visit. Hereupon the King gave to Seburga that parcel of land, consisting of 40 acres, where the visit took place, \u2014 to hold to her and her heirs, at a rent of 4s. per annum ; and Seburga retained the land to her death. In the year 1253, or nearly a century after this grant, King Henry III. impleaded Roger Corbet, then Lord of Hadley, for this parcel of land, which the King claimed as an ap purtenance of the Royal demesnes at Wellington. Roger Corbet was Great- Great- Grandson of Seburga, but he proved his title by the above narrative, and got the verdict of a Jury in his favour. William de Hadley (I.) left certainly two, and probably three sons by his wife Seburga. The second son William, sometimes called William de Hadley, and sometimes William de Ercalew, became Lord of High Ercall, in a way which I shall state elsewhere. The supposed third son, Jordan de Hadley, is found attesting a Charter of his Cousin, William Peverel, about the middle of Stephen's reign. Alan de Hadley, eldest son and heir of William de Hadley (I.), succeeded his Father about 1136, but came to his mother's estate at Hadley much later, if what I have said above is correct. In 1165 he appears in the Liber Niger as Alan de Headleg, and as holding the Fee of one Muntator in the Barony of Fitz Alan.6 It is not probable that this entry refers to or includes that estate at High Hatton which Alan de Hadley is known to have had. It refers to Hadley only, and his interest at High Hatton wiU require a dis tinct notice elsewhere. Alan de Hadley made several grants to Wombridge Priory, one of land in High Hatton, one of land in Ch errington, and another consisting of a ninth part of aU his tithable property. The first of these grants was probably a Con firmation of the original endowment provided by himself and his Parents for the Priory, but all three were recorded as his in a Charter of King Henry IL, which must have passed about 1181.

The King also appears to have retained his right to assess tallages in Bromley.8 In the year 1195, the Custos of the King's Escheats in Stafford shire accounts 7s. Id. for the issues or ferm of Bromley during such time as it had been in the King's hand.9 The inference from this is that Alan de Hadley had died between Michaelmas 1193 and Michaelmas 1195 (for these Escheators' accounts have a retrospect of two years) ; and that Bromley had remained an escheat for little more than a month. Subsequently we know that it was handed over to Roger Corbet of Tasley, as husband of Cecilia, daughter and sole heir of Alan de Hadley. On independent grounds I should fix on the year 1194 as that of Alan de Hadley's death and Roger Corbet's succession to Hadley. Alan de Hadley left his wife, Alice Pantulf, surviving. She was probably a daughter of that branch of the Pantulfs which was seated at Great Dawley. She had her dower in High Hatton. Of Cecilia de Hadley, as wife, first of Roger Corbet and then of Baldwin de Hodnet, and of her descendants and heirs, the Corbets of Hadley and Tasley, I have spoken at length already.10 Some few facts in the history of this branch of the Corbets are supplementary to that general account, and belong locally to Had ley. It was Roger Corbet (IL), the grandson of Cecilia de Hadley, who, in Michaelmas Term 1253 was impleaded by King Henry III. for 40 acres in Ayldulveston, as appurtenant to the King's demesne 1 Wombridge Chartulary, Tit.

Egidius de Erdinton, who prosecuted for the Crown, was more than a mere agent in the case, being in fact the then Tenant-in-capite of Wellington. Roger Corbet's first Plea was, that King Henry l\\. had never been seized in demesne of Welling ton, though he had been seized of the 40 acres in question. The Court seems to have disregarded this Plea, and indeed it can only have been true by some technical refinement. Corbet then told the story of the feoffment of his ancestress Seburga, as I have before related it. He further showed how his Grandfather, Roger Corbet, had married Cecilia, heiress of the said Seburga, and had done homage to King Richard for the land now in question, and had held it all his life. He also showed how the said Roger had been succeeded by his son, Thomas, father of the present Defendant ; how Thomas Corbet had done homage to King John for the land, and again had done homage to Thomas de Erdinton when the latter was enfeoffed by King John (in Wellington),11 and thirdly had done homage to Egidius de Erdinton, when the latter succeeded to his father, Thomas de Erdinton. Roger Corbet (II.) wound up his claim, as son of Thomas Corbet, and so heir of Seburga, to whom and to whose heirs Henry II. had given the land. The case went from Westminster to a provincial Jury, which sat at Sheriff Hales, before WiUiam Trussel, on September 5, 1254, and found the story of Seburga's feoffment by Henry II. to be true. This finding was returned to Westminster, and the Court determined that judgment should be given by the Justices next in eyre.12 The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 states as follows. \u2014 \" Roger Corbet holds the Manor of Hedleg', of the fee of John fitz Alan, for one sparrow-hawk, payable yearly to the same (John) at the feast of St. Peter ad Vincula ; and he (Roger) is to provide one Muntor, at his own cost, for 40 days, at the said John's Castle of Oswestry, in time of war ; and it (the Manor) is two hides, and half a knight's-fee ; and it pays 8d. motfee and 8c.. stretward (per annum) ; and it does suit to the Great Hundred-Court, at the She riff's Tourn, twice yearly ; and it does no suit to the Lesser Hun dred nor to the County, but the Jurors know not the warranty (for this exemption) .\"13 11 I doubt the truth of this, unless it was the custom for an heir prospective to do homage. It will be remembered that Cecilia de Hadley, through whom Thomas Corbet ultimately claimed, was living in 1221, that is, several years after the deaths both of Ring John and of Thomas de Er dinton (supra, Vol. I. p. 90). However, this does not aifect the merits of the case. ]2 Placita, Mich. Tm., 37 Hen. III., in. 6 dorso. 13 Rot. Hundred. II. 57."], [405, "357 HADLEY. I have reason to suppose that the services above recited included the services due on Hatton Hyneheath, and that the sparrow-hawk was the specific rent for that Manor, while the Muntor's service, equal to half a knight's-fee, was due on Hadley. Another half knight's-fee, due on Tasley, made Roger Corbet Tenant of a whole fee under Fitz Alan, and I find no instance where his collective military service is stated at more than a knight's-fee. I refer to a similar confusion in a previous Record, where Hadley and Hatton are said to constitute Corbet's single fee.14 Roger Corbet's marriage with Edelina, sister and in her issue co-heir of John fitz Philip (II.) of Bobbington, was only alluded to under Tasley, but more fully set forth under Quat.15 It was this marriage doubtless which secured to his descendants an interest in the Staffordshire Manor of Barlaston. The Feodary of the Barony of Oswestry, drawn up on the death of John fitz Alan (III.) in 1272, is so defaced, that we only know Hadley to have been mentioned therein from an ancient abstract. The Feodary of 1284, and a Tenure-Roll somewhat later, merely show Thomas Corbet (II.) as Richard fitz Alan's Tenant at Hadley, and that the Manor was geldable. I may add to what has been before said of this Thomas Corbet that he occurs as a Knight on August 11, 1290; as a Verderer of the King's Forests in May 1296, and that in 1297 he was returned from the County of Salop, as holding 20 librates of land and upwards, and was therefore sum moned to attend muster at London on July 7, to perform military service, with horse and arms, in parts beyond the seas.16 Though the Inquest on his death, in 1300, excludes aU mention of Hadley, it particularizes his Tenures at Hatton super Hyneheath, King's Bromley, and Barlaston. In the latter Vill he had a messuage and 80 acres of land. MeanwhUe the Assize Roll of 1292 makes mention of Thomas Cor bet's mother, as Edelina widow of Roger Corbet. She had, it seems, at some previous period disseized certain persons of land in Quat. Of Roger Corbet (III.), son and successor of Thomas, I have said little more under Tasley than that he was 28 years of age at Michaelmas 1300, and that he accounted as Sheriff of Salop and Staffordshire for such ferm as his Father, at his decease, had left in arrear. On October 21, 1302, \"Roger, son of Sir Thomas Corbet, Lord of Hadley,\" came to an agreement with Wombridge Priory concerning a right of common, asserted by Roger and denied 14 Supra Vol. I. p. 92. 15 Supra!

Corbet now abandoned such right of interference in the monastic tenements, and covenanted that he and his heirs would not so neglect their fences as to produce trespass on the said tene ments. The Priory was however to retain its own usual common rights throughout the whole fee of Hadley. For this arrangement the Canons paid Corbet 10 merks. Witnesses,\u2014 Peter de Eton (Eyton) ; Pagan de Preston ; John de Stivington ; WiUiam Hode ; and John de Bekeburi.17 In 1305, as we have seen,18 Roger Corbet was one of the expec tant coheirs of John fitz Philip of Bobbington, whose male line was shortly to expire with himself. Shaw gives two Bromley Deeds of Sir Roger Corbet, bearing date in 1 and 2 Edw. II. (1307-9). The second of these Deeds was sealed with these Arms, viz. Arg. two bars and a Canton Sa. with a Label of five points.19 There was a Roger Corbet returned as a Knight of the Shire for Salop, to three Parliaments in 1309 and 1311, and who in 1314 was a Commissioner of array in Salop and Staffordshire. I am doubtful whether this Roger Corbet was of Leigh 20 or of Hadley. Meantime we have a Deed ostensibly dated on October 13, 1309, whereby Roger Corbet, Lord of Hadelege, grants to William son of Richard Bleyn of Hadelege his two burgages in New-Street, Wellington ; \u2014 to hold of the Lords of the fee, but charged with an annual rent of 2s. to Wombridge Priory, for the souls of the Grantor and his wife Hawyse. Witnesses, \u2014 John Prior of Wombridge, WUliam de Lever sich, John de Diton, and Hugh Vicar of Welynton.21 This Deed is but a sample of many which purport to be transcribed in that most inaccurate of Records, \u2014 the Wombridge Chartulary. \u2014 It is probably misdated by more than 40 years. In March 1316 the Nomina Villarum gives Roger Corbet as Lord of the Vills of Hadley and Hatton in Shropshire, and of Barlaston and Bromley Regis in Staffordshire, also as Lord of the Vills of Ebrington and Fancott (Gloucestershire) and of Assington (Suffolk); also as Joint-Lord of the Vills of Marcham, Tubnay, and Frilford (Berkshire) and of Standlake and Brighthampton (Oxfordshire).

Corbet sat as a Knight of the Shire for Salop in July 1321, and was a Commissioner of array and for arresting malefactors in that County in January and November 1322. More distinctively a Com mission, as Conservator of the Peace in Salop, dated 12 December, 1321, is addressed to Roger Corbet of Haddele ; and, in February 1322, the same person, though described as Roger Corbet of Tasley, was Constable of the Castle of Helegh, which was garrisoned for the Crown. One Writ of May 1322, two of June 1322, one of De cember 1322, and two of January and May 1323, are addressed to Roger Corbet of Tasley, as a Commissioner of array in (Shropshire. In May and October 1324, Summonses to attend a Great Council and a Parliament, are addressed to Roger Corbet of Hadley ; but the Roger Corbet, who in January 1326 is named as an Inspector of array in Shropshire and Staffordshire, may have been of More ton, of Leigh, or of Hadley.32 Meantime, that is on May 8, 1323, Roger Corbet, Lord of Hadley, charges his manor of Hadley with 5s. annual rent, wherewith the Canons of Wombridge were to pur chase wine for the celebration of masses in their Church for ever.

This Deed is attested by WiUiam le Botiler of Wem, John le Strange of Whitchurch, and other persons, whose names are quite consistent with its aUeged date. However, Shaw has, without explanation, described its Seal as being the Seal of some Robert Corbet, whom he makes out to have been Uncle and afterwards heir of Roger, son of William, the Grantee.24 Of this statement I shall presently show the inaccuracy. On August 18, 1328, Roger Corbet, Lord of Haddelege, gives 10s. annual rent to Wombridge Priory, chargeable on a messuage and half a virgate in Hadley, in exchange for that ninth of his pos sessions at Hadley, which was claimed by the Priory.

These I take to have been the four sons of Sir Roger, named in order of seniority. An other Uppington Deed of January 6, 1333, mentions Sir Roger Corbet as Lord of the lands thus conveyed, and is attested by Sir John Corbet. Another Deed of June 29, 1344, is a concession to Sir Roger Corbet of Hadley; another of August 1, 1344, is a si milar concession, and is attested by Sir Robert Corbet, Knight, and passed at Hadley. Again, a Deed of July 1, 1349, indicates that Sir Roger Corbet of Hadley was stiU Uving, and still interested in Up pington. This is the latest notice I have of Sir Roger Corbet, whose age at the period cannot have been much less than 77. Now therefore I proceed to say something of his sons. \u2014 Sir John Corbet, the eldest, appears on the Roll of the Battle of Boroughbridge, in 1322, his armorial bearings being described as \u2014 Arg. two bars and a Canton Gu. with a label of the first.26 In May 1324, he was summoned, to a Great Council at Westminster, as Sir John Corbet de Haddeley, Knight.27 We have seen him attesting his Father's Deeds from 1323 to 1333. It will be shown that he was living in 1346, but it is probable that soon after the latter year he died ; \u2014 whether with or without issue, I will not here conjecture. Sir William Corbet, second son of Sir Roger, was, as we have seen, Grantee of King's Bromley in 1327, and a witness of a grant to his Father in 1331. In 1337 he is mentioned in connection with the Hertfordshire Manor of Pyriton. The Inquest on his death says that he died on October 14th, 1345. The King's Writ announcing that event is dated October 20, 1345, and the Inquest, taken in Hertfordshire on February 7, 1346, states that his next heir was his brother John, aged 30 years and more28 (he must have been nearly 50). Thus Bromley and Pirington will have gone for a time to Sir John Corbet, though his Father was living. Sir Robert Corbet, third presumed son of Sir Roger, has been seen to attest a grant to his Father in September 1331. I find him a fellow-witness with his father stiU earlier, viz. on April 1, 1325, and it is possible that it was his Seal which was appended to a Deed of his Father's in 1327.29 If so, the engrailed border, which 26 The mark of cadency here used is worth observation. \u2014 John Corbet's Arms are distinguished from those of his living Father, by changing the tincture of the Ordinaries from Sable to Gules. 27 Parliamentary Writs, IV. 715. 28 Inquisitions, 20 Edw.

In 1333-4 we have seen that Sir Robert Corbet of Hadley was husband of Matilda, probably the widow of that Sir Fulk Pembruge who died in January 1326.30 This Sir Robert Corbet was he who has appeared above as a Wit ness on August 1, 1344. He was Uving, as I know, in 1348, and was then the husband of a second wife, Elizabeth, by whom he had a daughter, Hawyse, born on December 6th of that year. It is also clear that Sir Robert Corbet had Kings Bromley from, or after, his elder brother John, who was living in 1346, for Sir Robert, conjointly with his wife Elizabeth, died seized of Kings Bromley. His death and that of his wife took place before 1354, for a King's Writ of January 17, 1354, announces the death of \" Elizabeth, widow of Robert Corbet.\" The consequent Inquisition found that Hawyse, daughter and heir of the said Elizabeth, was aged 5 years on December 6, 1353.31 Another Writ of February 10, 1354, is to inquire why Kings Bromley had been seized into the King' s-hand ; to which the Escheator replies that he had so seized it because Elizabeth, widow of Robert Corbet, had held the Manor in capite conjointly with her late husband on the day of his death.31 A third Writ of May 28, 1354, shows that the King was inquiring as to the merits of a petition presented in the name of Hawyse, \" daughter and heir of Robert Corbet and of his wife Elizabeth,\" and complaining that Kings Bromley, being held in fee-farm, and not by military service, should have been seized in manu Regis. An Inquest taken on the subject found that Kings Bromley was held in socage, for a rent of \u00a34. per annum, and not by knight's service?1 On October 12, 1361, the King's Writ of Diem clausit announced the death of Hawyse, daughter of Robert Corbet. A Jury which sat on November 21, fixed the day of her death four days later than that of the King's Writ, but found that she had held Kings Bromley in capite, but no other lands in Staffordshire, and that her heir was \u2014 Robert Corbet or Haddeleye, aged 30 years and more.32 The question is, \u2014 who was this Robert Corbet of Hadley, and I can have no hesitation in saying that he must have been Grandson of Sir Roger and son of Sir John, and consequently first cousin of Hawyse. The Wombridge Chartulary shows him to have been in possession of Hadley in 1354, that is, five years after the latest 30 Supra, VoL II. pp. 226, 239, 240. I 31 Inquisitions, 28 Edw. III., No. 25.

The probable date of its foundation was in the last five years of the reign of Henry I., \u2014 that is, between 1130 and 1135, \u2014 so that it was nearly cotemporary with Haughmond and Buildwas, and, as we shall here after see, not much earlier than LilleshaU. The earliest direct Grant which the Chartulary of this House exhibits, is in a mutilated form. It is the sanction given by the first WUliam fitz Alan, as Seigneural Lord of Hadley and High Hatton, to the previous act of his Feoffees, as regards the foundation of Wombridge. It runs as foUows, if I read it rightly. \u2014 \"Willielmus filius Alani, etc. Notum sit me concedere et carta, mea confirmare donacionem Willielmi, et uxoris ejus Saburg\u00e6 de Hedlega,1 et Alani eorum filii, etc., quam ipsi in perpetuam elemos- ynam Canonicis de Wombrug pro salute anim\u00e6 su\u00e6 (sic) dederunt, videlicet, locum ilium in sUv& de Hedlega, qui, ex uno latere, rivulo uno terminatur, qui silvam de Hedlega et silvam Regis discriminat, secundo vero latere, alio rivulo finitur qui dicitur Sprungewallabroc, tercioque latere sui terminum facit Watlingestret ; \u2014 et dimidium . frondellum iUud (quod) Morfan (sic pro Moyses) quidam Iherosolimi- tanus tenuit in Hectona (High Hatton), libere et quiete, etc. H.

If so, it suggests a far earlier limit for the \u00e6ra of the first William Burnel than that which I have hitherto been able to assign,2 and it shows the first John le Strange as a Shropshire Vassal of Fitz Alan at a period when there is another shadowy hint that he might have been so. The alternative is to Feoffee in Hadley, and that her husband's interest arose only in jure uxoris. We have had another hint (supra, p. 354) that Seburga was the real Tenant-in-fee. 1 An expression hardly equivalent to donacionem Willielmi de Hedlega et uxoris ejus Saburg\u00e6.

Between these three dates I will not here attempt to decide, as they do not affect the immediate question, viz. the period of actual foundation ;\u2014 for the Suzerain's Confirma tion may have passed long afterwards. The acquisitions made by this Priory during the first fifty years of its existence were very few. They are marked in a Charter of Confirmation granted by Henry II. at Feckenham (Worcestershire), and which probably passed in the Autumn of 1181. This Charter indicates St. Leonard as the Patron Saint of Wombridge, and con firms the following grants to the Canons, viz. Alan de Hadley's grants of aforndell in Cherrington, half aforndell in Hecton (High Hatton), and a ninth of all his tithable possessions; \u2014 William de Ercalew's3 grant of a similar ninth ;\u2014 the grant by Seburga, mother of the said WiUiam, ot aforndell in WeUington ;* \u2014 aforndell in Tib berton, given by Ralph Pantulf; \u2014 aforndell in Hosberton, given by Hamund Pichard ; \u2014 and the grant made by Walter de DunstanviUe and his father, as it has already been described under Shiffnal.5 This Confirmation of Henry II. was attested by Godfrey de Luci; Master Joceline, Archdeacon of Chichester ; Humphrey de Bohun, Constable (of England) ; Roger Bigod ; Robert fitz Bernard ; Ralph fitz Stephen, Chamberlain; and Michael Belet.6 The same witnesses attest another Charter of Henry IL, which passed at Lichfield, evidently during the same Iter of the King. Thereby the King gives to the Priory 80 acres of assarts at Wom brugge, quit of all regard and exaction of the Forest.6 The earliest Papal recognition of Wombridge Priory is by Pope Urban III., and bears date at Verona on June 23, 1187. This imposing document is in the form usually granted at that period to Augustine Houses. It takes the Canons of St. Leonard into the protection of St. Peter, enjoins on them the observance of Augustine Rule, confirms their possessions, acquired and to be acquired, allows them to celebrate divine services under certain restrictions, during the period of an Interdict, gives them right of free sepulture in their Church under certain limitations, fortifies them against the erection of other Chapels or Oratories in their Parish, and gives them the right of electing their own Priors.

They are for the most part identical with, or slight variations of, the grants confirmed by Henry II. , but there are one or two additions. The Site of the Church of Wombridge with all appurtenances is confirmed. Sutton Church had come to the Advowson of the Canons in the mode already described ; 7 and Rainald, a brother of the House, had given two manses, and four acres in Newport (Novoburgo). The ninths granted by Alan de Hadley and his brother WUliam, are confirmed by the Bull, as \" the tithe which the Canons had in Hetleia (Had ley) and Herkolina (ErcaU) .\" 8 Lastly, this Bull exempts from any tithes, all lands (novalia) brought into cultivation by, and farmed by, the Canons, and all fodder of their live-stock.9 Before the end of the twelfth century Wombridge Priory had obtained footing in the Manors of Uppington and Harrington, and had got the Advowsons of Loppington Church and of Uppington Chapel. With reference to the last acquisition and to that of Sutton Church, the earUest Episcopal Charters, which were pre served by the Priory, were drawn up. They were three in number, all by Bishop Hugh de Novant, and aU were obtained in or before the year 1190. The earliest Archiepiscopal Confirmation to Wombridge is that of Baldwin, Archbishop of Canterbury, concerning the Church of Sutton Maddock. I have already alluded to it, and fixed its date as between 1187 and 1190.10 I will now cease to speak of those smaU but innumerable grants, which the Canons of Wombridge were so indefatigable in securing, but which belong more especially to the localities of the grants themselves. The House never attained great wealth or influence. The reasons were, that it was deficient in prestige, and unfortunate in position. It was not, like Haughmond, founded by a Fitz Alan, but only by one of Fitz Alan's Vassals. It was rivalled in every direction by Monasteries, whose antecedents threw it completely into shade. Haughmond, Buildwas, Shrewsbury, and LUleshall, founded by Barons, Bishops, Earls, and Kings, were formidable competitors for eleemosynary benefactions, and all stood within twelve miles of Wombridge.

I find, by a mere accident, that the Suffolk Priory of Brisett sometime claimed a superiority over Wombridge. Brisett was an Augustine House, dedicated to St. Leonard. Its very great anti quity was probably connected with its claim to dominion over cer tain other Augustine Houses. The Canons of Brisett, it seems, impleaded Haughmond Abbey for the two subject houses of Wom bridge and Ranton. Haughmond made good its title to Ranton as an affiliation of its own, but paid the Brisett Canons 40s. for re mitting their claim.11 As to Wombridge, the Canons of Haugh mond asserted no right over that, but what further proceeding took place between Wombridge and Brisett, I cannot say. I only know that Wombridge did not eventually succumb. I will now take a chronological view of such Records and Docu ments as relate to the internal \u0153conomy of this Priory, or are evidences of its general prosperity. \u2014 It obtained no less than three Bulls, apparently from Pope Inno cent IIL, granting protection to the House and its possessions. These, if rightly ascribed to that mighty Pontiff, bear date June 20, 1199, April 11, 1205, and August 5, 1205. Another Bull of the same Pope is dated on April 12, 1205, and is addressed to the Abbot of Shrewsbury. The Canons of Wombridge had petitioned the Pope, that they might not, under pretext of any Letters of the Holy See, or its Legates, be compelled to pay any debts, unless it could be clearly proved that such debts had been contracted in fur therance of the interests of the Priory. The Abbot of Shrewsbury is informed of the Pope's assent to the prayer of this petition, and he is to enforce the immunity of the Wombridge Canons from all such debts, and against all who molest them unduly for payment thereof.13 A fifth Bull of Pope Innocent, dated on the 5th of August, 1205, is addressed to the Prior of Wenlock. It forbids that any Delegate of the Papal See shall utter sentence of Interdict, excommunication, or suspension against the Fraternity of Wom bridge, without special license so to do, obtained from the Pope 11 Haughmond Chartulary, so. 173 \u2014 This composition between Brisett and Haughmond was ratified by three Com missioners, appointed to settle the dispute by the Pope. They were R., Abbot of St. Osyth, P., Abbot of Cogoseh, and R., Prior of Colum; that is, I take it, by Ralph, Abbot of St. Osyth, or Chich (Es sex), Peter, Abbot of Coggeshall (Essex), and the cotemporary Prior of Colne (Es sex). I suppose the transaction to belong to the reign of Henry IL, or Richard I. 12 Appendix (ut supra), Nos. x. and viii."], [415, "367 WOMBRIDGE PRIORY. himself. The Prior of Wenlock is ordered to prevent all persons from troubling the Canons, in any way contrary to the tenour of the above indulgence.13 In the Shropshire Forest-Roll of 1209 the Prior of Wombridge is twice assessed for some privUeges or encroachments within the Forest of Mount Gilbert. On May 12, 1224, a Bull of Pope Ho norius III. vouchsafes the protection of St. Peter to the Convent and its possessions, and especiaUy confirms its ecclesiastical acqui sitions at Sutton, Loppington, and Uppington.14 On November 22, 1248, a Fine was levied at Shrewsbury which shows perfectly what family had founded, and who retained, at least the nominal patronage, of Wombridge Priory. The Fine was be tween Roger Corbeth, Plaintiff, and Baldwin, Prior of Wombridge, concerning a complaint of Roger Corbeth, viz. that the said Bald win, to the disinheritance of the Plaintiff, had permitted himself to be presented to the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, before he had been presented to the Plaintiff, as the Priors elect, Baldwin's predecessors, had customarily been presented to the Plaintiff's an cestors. The Plea, which had been set on foot touching this matter, was now compounded as follows. \u2014 The Prior conceded that the Plaintiff and his heirs, in case of any future vacancy by death of a Prior, should take a certain simple seizin in the Priory, by their Serviens, who was however to have no rule or administration of things in the Priory, but was to stay therein tiU a Prior-elect was admitted by the Bishop and confirmed in his office. The Canons were to elect such Prior without the Plaintiff's license, to present the Elect to Corbet and his heirs, if in England ; \u2014 if not, then to his principal servant, Bailiff for the time being, at Hedleg. And Corbet and his heirs were to go in person or send Letters-Patent, presenting the Elect to the Bishop ; otherwise the Canons were to present. In return for all this, Corbet renounced all right to any custody of lands, without the Priory, and to any other custody whatever, within the Priory, except as aforesaid. On Dec. 28, 1258, Bishop Roger de Molend, having inspected certain Charters of his predecessors, Geoffrey and Alexander, rela tive to the appropriations of the Churches of Sutton and Lopping ton and the Chapel of Uppington by Wombridge Priory, allows the validity of those instruments, and confirms the Priory in its rights. The Bishop did this out of consideration for the devoutness of the 13 Appendix (ut supra), Nos. x. and viii. | \" Appendix (ut supra), No. xiij."], [416, "368 WOMBRIDGE ABBEY Convent in religious observances, and out of compassion for its poverty.15 In two instances this Priory obtained a relaxation of the Statutes of Mortmain from Edward I. One was in 1281, and has been de scribed under Haughton.16 The other was on November 26, 1290, when the Priory was allowed to acquire a messuage and virgate in Brockton from John le Clerk of Brockton.17 The Taxation of 1291 exhibits the Temporalities of Wombridge Priory, scanty though they doubtless were, as ridiculously low. Three carucates of land at Cherrington, worth 30s. per annum, three ca- rucates at Wycleye (in Uppington) worth 36s., and one carucate at Surlowe (in High Ercall) worth 12s. ; these, together with 12s. for the profits of live stock, realized a total of \u00a34. 10s., and that was the whole reputed income of the Convent.18 I need not say that it had several other estates, or remark that the assarted lands, con- tiguous to the House itself, are not included in the above estimate. Perhaps the said assarts fell under the title of Novalia, and so were justly exempt from Papal Taxation. In 1315 or 1316 Bishop Langton visited this Priory, and a Letter which he subsequently wrote to the Prior and Canons is reprehensive of many things which he had discovered or observed. The Prior forsooth was too sohcitous about the temporal prosperity of his House. The Prior had been selling Liveries (i.e. Corrodies) without assent of his Chapter or of the Bishop; \u2014 at least he is forbidden to do so. Brother Thomas de Broughton, a Canon, is not to intromit in secular Courts, or in matters which had not the smallest relation to the Priory. He is to be recalled home, and remain with his Brethren, and under Religious Rule. A com mon Chamberlain is to provide the Canons' vestments.19 Silence is to be observed at the proper hours and in the proper places. Women are not to enter the choir or cloisters so often and so indiscriminately as at present. The sick are to be more carefully and more generously dieted than the healthy. The pains of the Greater Excommunication, and other threats, are held out in case of disobedience to these orders.20 The Charters and Patents of Edward II. to this Priory require our next notice.

Another dated at York on March 15, 1319, is an In speximus and Confirmation of the three Charters of Henry II. and the two Charters of Edward I. already noticed.21 A third, which, as printed elsewhere,22 1 need not minutely describe, is a general recitation and confirmation of all benefactions to the Priory, except Royal Grants and Grants of Advowsons. This Charter, I should observe, alludes to the gifts of the Founders of Wombridge, with out mentioning the Founders' names, but only citing the concession and confirmation thereof by WUliam fitz Alan. This is not contrary to, but is less than, the truth ; and hence it has come to pass that WilUam fitz Alan has been reputed to have founded Wombridge. On July 18, 1323, Bishop Northburgh, then at Worfield, aUows the Fraternity of Wombridge, in consideration of their necessities, to sell a Canon's corrody to Henry de Tonge, Chaplain, for his life.23 A mandate of this same Prelate, which should apparently be dated on March 2, 1325, is for the absolution, re-admission, and punish ment within the Convent, of Brother Roger de Eytone, a Canon of the House, who under pretext of going on a pilgrimage had left the Priory, and then, casting aside his regular habit, had lived a secular life for some time, but had now submitted himself to the Bishop, and to whatever sentence the Bishop might pass on his crime.2* A document in the Wombridge Chartulary purports to be an \" Indulgence for the Church and the New Chapel of St. Mary and St. Leonard of Wombridge.\"25 Its object is to increase the attendance of the liberal and pious at services of the said Church and Chapel ; and I suppose that the Chapel, dedicated to the Holy Virgin, had recently been buUt. The document is in the names of six foreign Bishops sitting in conclave at Annucium on January 25, a.d. 1328, and in the twelfth year of Pope John.26 It promises 40 days' indulgence from penance, on behalf of each of the conclave, and with consent of the Diocesan Bishop, for such persons as the following : \u2014 aU the confessed and truly penitent, who shall attend the said Church or Chapel on any feast of St. Mary, on the feasts of the Nativity and Translation of St. Leonard, on the day of the said Church's dedi cation, or on other specified occasions, as worshippers, supplicants, or pilgrims (causa devocionis, oracionis vel peregrinacionis) ; \u2014 all who shaU attend masses, sermons (predicationibus) , or other divine 21 Appendix (ut supra), No. xij. 22 Monasticon, YI. 388-390. 23 Regist.

I now pass over two centuries, and arrive at some details of a very different character. In the 27th year of Henry VIII. (1535-6), William, last Prior of Wombridge, made his declaration before the King's Commissioners of the Receipts of the Priory.27 Its Tempo- ralities realized \u00a362. 9s. per annum, of which I should here specify one or two items, more particularly arising from its precinct and home estate. \u2014 Four messuages and one cottage in Okynyate (now Oaken Gates) produced \u00a33. 15s. 4>d. An Iron Forge (molendinum ferrarium) in Woborne (Wombridge) produced 13s. 4d. A coal- mine there produced \u00a35. The demesne-lands, meadows, and pas- tures, lying in Woborne and occupied by the Prior and Convent, produced \u00a36. 13s. 4c?. The perquisites of Court in all the Manors of the Priory were 5s. Again, the total Spiritualities of the Priory were valued at \u00a310. 6s. 8d., of which sum 13s. 4d. resulted from the tithes and alterages of four messuages in Okynyate, and 10s. from the average Oblations, offered yearly to St. Leonard, within the Priory Church. The Gross Income of the Priory, viz. \u00a372. 15s. 8d. per annum, was charged to the extent of \u00a37. 8s. 4d., leaving a net income of \u00a365. 7s. 4d.

Henry was Prior, at least as early as 1220, and remained so in November 1236.29 Baldwin occurs as Prior in a Fine of April 30, 1245, and there are reasons for thinking that his appointment was then recent. He occurs again in November 1248. Two versions of a Deed which perhaps passed about 1260, respectively give B. and S. as the initial letters of the then Prior's name. If the former be correct, as most probably it is, Baldwin's tenure of office will have been longer than we can decide it to have been, on any good evidence. Walter was Prior here in October 1270. Philip occurs as Prior in March 1284,30 and thenceforward con tinuously till April 21, 1321, when a Letter of Bishop Langton's informs us that in consequence of his recent decease, the Canons of Wombridge had elected \u2014 Brother Richard de Meston, to be their Prior. The Bishop first annuls the election as informal; but, referring to the good character and antecedents of the Nominee, concludes by ordaining him to the office, by special grace?1 Richard was still in office in 28 Monasticon, VI. 391, No. II. 29 Supra, Vols.

The Commissioners reported on July 27, that they had found the said election to have been rightly and canonically conducted, and that they had ordered the installation of the said Prior elect.33 This Prior is, I presume, the same with him who is called \u2014 John Langley, and who, being dead in 1373, was succeeded by \u2014 John de Watford.34 This John, I presume, it was, who occurs as Prior in 1377. A Patent of indemnity, granted, I think, by Henry VI., will, if so, fix the date of another \u2014 John, Prior of Wombridge, as holding office in July 1425.35 A similar Patent, certainly by Henry VI., and being of date November 13, 1446, names \u2014 William Russhton as the then Prior of Wombridge.36 Fulk Eyton, a member of the family seated at Eyton on the Weald-Moors, by his WiU, dated February 18, 1451, bequeaths \"a vestiment to Wembrege, to pray for my fadre soule and my mo deres.\" I rather think that \u2014 John de Eyton, another member of the same family, was Prior of Wombridge at the time. Certainly he held that office in January 1460. Thomas Forster, sometime Prior of Wombridge, Warden of Tong and Vicar of Idsall, died in 1520, and was buried at Idsall, where his tomb may stiU be seen. William, last Prior of Wombridge, was in office in 1535-6, and till the Dissolution. WOMBRIDGE CHURCH. This Church, dedicated to St. Leonard, and containing a Chapel, dedicated to St. Mary, was at first merely Conventual.

After what has been observed under WUley, Norton, Langley, and Leegomery, we are of course not to expect to find Toret' s de scendants inheriting anything, even in a Manor which he retained at Domesday. It was probably on Toret's removal from Rodington that the Manor was subdivided. \u2014 At aU events it was before the death of Henry I. that Rodington and half Sugden were made a distinct Tenure, and given (with the exception perhaps of one tenement) to a Feoffee, who, himsetf or his heir, was in 1165 holding a Muntator's fee in Fitz Alan's Barony, and who is caUed Gwomar le Rotur in the Liber Niger,2 his name being, I suppose, Le Roturier. This Gwomar, or his successor of the same name, occurs to us as Daumer de Rodington in April,3 and as Guomar de Rodinton in October 1203, when he essoigned his attendance, at the common 1 Supra, Vol. VI. p. 351. 1 Domesday, so. 254, b, 2. 2 Liber Niger, I. 143."], [422, "374 RODINGTON. summons, to meet the King's Justices at Shrewsbury. A Deed in the Haughmond Chartulary which must have passed within five years after these Assizes has the attestation of Guimar de Rodintone. This Guimar, or rather his father, was, it seems, a Benefactor to Haughmond Abbey. As Gymer de Rodinton, he \" concedes to the said Abbey the meadow of Erwileie, which his Father had previously given in frank-almoign, receiving however 9s. from the Canons for the same.\" For the present concession and confirma tion the Canons now pay 2\\ merks more to the Son.

This was \u2014 Ranulf, son of Gilbert de Rodinton.5 Under that name he concedes to Haughmond Abbey \" the Ley (Legam) which was at the head of Beddeslega, which was of his inheritance, according to the boundary of the ditch which extends through the Schedoc of Tyrne up to Roden, which Ley his Father and mother gave to the same Canons in pure almoign.\" He not only confirms the above grant of his Parents, but sells to the Canons, for 40s., another meadow of his inheritance, which was near his Fishery of Time. He directs that none of his heirs (ne aliquis heredum meorum) shall trouble the Canons in regard to the premises. This Deed is attested by Robert fitz William (who was dead in 1203) and by WiUiam de Ercalwe.6 William fitz Alan confirmed the sale above negotiated, as the sale of a meadow, called Rondulfuseie, situated near the Fishery of Ranulph de Rodinton, and for which the said Ranulph had received 3 merks, towards paying his debts. Gregory the Priest and WUliam fitz Wido attest Fitz Alan's confirmation.7 Another Grant by this Ranulph, I will give as it stands in the Haughmond Chartulary. \u2014 \" Notum sit tarn presentibus quam futuris quod ego Ranulphus de Rodintona concessi et confirmavi vendicionem prati quod dicitur Sistannes-eie, quod Gilbertus nepos meus, sicut de hereditate sua, vendidit Canonicis Sancti Johannis Evangelist\u00e6 de Haghmon ad opus ecclesi\u00e6 eorum, pro decem soUdis ; \u2014 libere et quiete ab omni 4 Chartulary, so. 222. p. 267).

It is clear too, I think, that whatever Ranulf had in Rodington was held immediately under Fitz Alan, that it descended to Ranulf from his father, Gilbert, and not from Guomar de Rodinton. We see then that the Manor of Rodington-proper was not a single tenement held by one Feoffee, and it is exceedingly probable that Ranulph de Rodington' s interest was quite distinct from that Muntator's fee, or half knight's-fee, which I shall hereafter show to have passed of Shrewsbury; \u2014 and once forming part of the Newport Evidences. 8 Chartulary, so. 172. 9 In possession of Mr. George Morris,"], [424, "376 RODINGTON. from Guomar de Rodintone to certain Coparceners, of whom Ranulf was not one. For the present, continuing my account of \u2014 Ranulf de Rodinton, or of his son of the same name, I observe that Ranulf de Rodinton occurs on an Inquest which must have been held in the summer of 1220, and that a Patent of August 30, 1228, directs WilUam Pantulf of Hales and others to try a cause which was pending between the Abbot of Haghmon and Randolf de Roden ton, concerning a Watercourse in Rodinton. On May 13, 1234, Ranulf de Rodinton attests an agreement between the Abbot of Shrewsbury and WUliam de Ercalwe. About the year 1249 we have Ranulph de Rodinton attesting a Deed, already cited under Downton. In 1255 the Bradford Hundred- Roll names Ranulf de Rodinton among Fitz Alan's Tenants of the Manor, but estimates the gross tenure to be three parts of a knights'-fee.10 I doubt whether the original half-fee was thus increased by any service due on the feoffment of Ranulf de Rodinton. Ranulf de Rodinton was deceased in 1274. He left a Widow, Agnes, and at least two sons, Henry and William. WUliam sold something in Rodington to his brother Henry, and perhaps it was this William who as William de Rodinton is found attesting a Charter of Shrewsbury Abbey between 1259 and 1266.11 Be this as it may, a Writ of King Edward I., dated November 27, 1273, orders an Extent to be made of Rodinton, seeing that IsabeUa, widow of John fitz Alan (III.), claimed a third of the Manor (i. e. of the Seigneurial rights there) in dower. The return to this Writ, made probably in January 1274, valued the whole Manor of Rodington at \u00a33. 10s. \\\\d., excepting the tallage of Rodenhurst and the dower of Agnes, widow of Ranulf de Rodinton. Among the items included in the valuation was a rent of 9s. from land, which had been Ranulf de Rodinton's. This, I presume, was the chief rent due to Fitz Alan, and it would seem that Ranulf de Rodinton's heir was not yet in possession. The following Deed must however have passed soon afterwards. \u2014 Henry son of Ranulph de Rodinton gives to Haghmon Abbey, towards the lights of the Greater Altar, for the souls' health of himself and his wife AUce, his ancestors and successors, a rent of 2s. issuing from half a virgate in Rodinton, which rent Isabella de Rodinton had already assigned to the Canons,1\" and which land 10 Rot.

We shall presently see too, that the Feodary of 1284, enumerating Fitz Alan's Feoffees in Rodington, names Henry Forester as one of them. This was undoubtedly Henry de Rodington, but I can learn nothing afterwards of him or his successors. I now return to speak of the feoffment and the presumed descendants of \u2014 Guomar de Rodington. \u2014 The inheritance of half a knight's-fee in Rodington, as held under Fitz Alan, can be traced from Guimar de Rodington, living in 1203, to three coparceners, perhaps his daughters. Their names were Isabel, Clarice, and Petronilla ; \u2014 and I will say something of all and each. Clarice married Roger de Apley. Hence the Feo daries of 1240 say that \" Roger de Appeleg and his coparceners hold half a fee in Rodinton of the Barony of John fitz Alan.\"16 The name of Isabel de Rodinton's husband I cannot discover, but he was dead in 1246. Petronilla de Rodinton married Robert de Kaynton, otherwise called Robert de Rodinton on account of this marriage. Both were dead in 1246, and their only daughter and heir, Juliana, was then the wife of Richard de Flotebroch. Hence a Fine about Rodington Advowson, levied April 22, 1246, gives Isabella de Rodyngton, Roger de Appelegh with Clarice his wife, and Richard de Flotebroch with Juliana his wife, as joint Plaintiffs. Before 1255 another change had taken place in this estate, for Roger and Clarice de Apley were now represented by their son in such passages as the above. By the way is perhaps the vulgar expression which approaches nearest to the meaning. The Rubricator of the Haughmond Char tulary has entitled Henry de Rodington's Deed as a Confirmation of Isabella de Ro dington's previous deed.\" Her Charter shall be given in its proper place ; \u2014 but I should here say that so far from Henry de Ro- dington's Deed being a Confirmation thereof, the two Charters have every ap pearance of being independent acts of two rival claimants, renouncing, at different times, their respective claims, in favour of a third party. 13 Chartulary, so. 172. \" Supra, p. 256. 15 Testa de Nevill, pp. 44, 47, 49. 48 VII."], [426, "378 RODINGTON.

Among others, Geoffrey le Taylur and his wife Agatha were sued for one-third of the Manor of Rodinton.18 The result of this Suit is not to my present purpose ; but it will render the sequel more intelligible, if I suggest that Agatha, thus named, must have been the daughter or other heir of that John de Apley who was seized of a share of Rodinton in 1255. The In quest which, about January 1274, valued Rodinton with regard to Isabel fitz Alan's suit, I have already quoted. All that I need add here is that a messuage, \" held wholly by Geoffrey le Taylur,\" is stated to be worth 4s. per annum, the assized rents of free-tenants 16 Rot. Hundred.

Geoffrey le Taylur occurs in a lawsuit of 1277, which I will notice under Sugden, and as a local Juror in 1278. Richard de Rodinton, Juror on a Wem Inquest in January 1284, was perhaps identical with Richard de Flotesbruc. The Feodary of 1284 says that \" Philip Mavesin, Henry Forester, Richard de Flosbrok, and Geoffrey le Taylur hold the vill of Rodinton and half the vill of Suggedon, of Richard fitz Alan, for half a knight's-fee.\" The Bradford Tenure- Roll of (nearly the same date) repeats the statement, except that the first coparcener's name is written Mueyson. I con ceive that the said Philip Mavesin, or Mueyson, held the share which had previously belonged to Isabel de Rodinton. Soon after this, Richard de Flosbrok was succeeded by his son Jordan. The latter, as Jordan de Flossebroc, inspects and confirms the Charter of \" PetroniUa his Grandmother (avi\u00e6 me\u00e6), formerly wife of Robert de Kaynton,\" by which she had given 2s. rent in Rodinton Mill to Haghmon. He further aUows that, if he or his heirs should in any year fail to pay the said rent-charge, then it should be lawful for the Canons of Haughmond to levy one or more distresses upon Rodinton-Mill, and to drive or carry away whatever effects should be so taken in distress, either to Haughmond Abbey or elsewhere within the county of Salop, and retain them without replevin (contra vadium et plegios), till such time as the said Jordan or his heirs should pay the said rent, with all arrears thereof. The only witness of Jordan de Flossebroc's confirmation is Philip de Peninton.20 By Deed, bearing date at Rodinton on Sunday, March 25, 1313, John son of Geoffrey le Tailor of Rodinton inspects and confirms the Charter of Clarice, formerly wife of Roger de Apelegh, relative to a rent of I2d. in the same Mill.

It is singular that Domesday should mention a Church and a Priest under Rodington, and make no such allusions under High Ercall ; for it is certain that both these Manors belonged to one Saxon Parish, and that within nine years after Domesday the Mother Church of that Parish was reputed to be at Ercall, and was given as the \" Church of Archalou, with all its appurtenances,\" by Earl Roger to Shrewsbury Abbey. What remained at Rodington was a Church or Chapel, dependent on Ercall, and so in the pre sentation of the Abbot of Shrewsbury. The only occasion on which this status of Rodington Church was disputed, ended in a way which proves the Abbot's title. \u2014 On April 22, 1246, a Fine was levied at Westminster, whereby Isabella de Rodyngton (Robert son of Baldwin Wychard being her Attor ney) , Roger de Appeleg and Clarice his wife, Richard de Flotebroch and Juliana his wife, Plaintiffs, quit-claim to Adam Abbot of Salop, Deforciant, the Advowson of the Church of Rodyngton, whereof an assize of dernier presentment had been pending between the parties. Moreover the Plaintiffs conceded to the Abbot and his successors a right of estovers in Rodyngton Wood ; for all which the Abbot re ceived them into the prayers of his House for ever. The Taxation of 1291 does not name Rodington Church. In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth distinctly state that Rodington and Upton Parva were Chapelries of Ercall; though they taxed the three as separate Parishes. Their assessment of Rodington was 18s., and not more, because the income of Rodington Chapel con sisted chiefly of small-tithes and oblations, \u2014 things which were not to be accounted of, in estimating a tax on wheat, wool, and lamb ; \u2014 because also the corn in this Parish was very deficient.23 The Valor of 1524^-5 gives the preferment of Roger Grene, Rector of Rodyngton as netting \u00a36. 13s. 4d. per annum?* EARLY INCUMBENTS.

On December 17, 1300, being still a Subdeacon, Richard de Alberbury, Rector of Rodington, has the Bishop's license to attend the Schools for seven years, and meantime not to be compelled to take higher Orders. William, Rector of Rodington, died August 18, 1349 (probably of the Pestilence), and on October 17 \u2014 John de Rodenhurst, Chaplain, was admitted, on presentation of Shrewsbury Abbey.

This Vill constituted one out of the 4j hides which were involved in the Domesday Manor of Rodington. Half of it, as we have seen, continued to be held together with Rodington, by the Coheirs of Guomar de Rodington, under Fitz Alan. These Coheirs, however, had, I think, their Feoffees or Undertenants here, \u2014 persons who took their name from the place. The first of these De Sugdons was \u2014 Daumar de Suggedon, who attests a Charter of William de Ercalewe, early in the thirteenth century. Also, Daumar de Sog gedon gave to Haghmon Abbey, with his body in burial, and for the souls' health of himself, his father, and all his friends (parentum), half a virgate in Soggeden, viz. that which William le Waleis held. He gave it with rights of common, in wood and in plain, etc., and quit of all secular service. Witnesses, \u2014 William de Ercalwe, and Hugh Forester (i. e. Hugh fitz Robert, Forester of Bolas) .25 It seems that this Daumar was son of another Daumar, and that he had a brother Geoffrey, to whom the Canons of Haughmond re granted the above half- virgate at a rent of 2*. per annum.

Richard, son of Geoffrey Daumer of Suggedon, gives to Hagh mon Abbey that rent of Id., which he had been wont to receive from the land which William Bridde (identical with William Wa lensis) held in Suggedon.

Witness, \u2014 Alexander, then Official (of some Church Dignitary, I presume). There was also a Convention between the Abbot of Haghmon and William de Berewic relative to the above half-virgate, by which the Abbot's rent of 2s. was nearly doubled. \" The Abbot concedes and quit-claims to William de Berewic and his heirs that half virgate in Suggedon, which Daumer bequeathed with his body to the Abbey, and which William de Berewic bought from Geoffrey, brother of the said Daumer.

In the middle of the same century, one Pagan de Sugdon occurs, but how he was related to the above Sugdons, I cannot say. He was a Juror on an important Inquest in 1253, and in 1255 he is 28 Chartulary, Tit.

He did ward at Oswestry Castle for 10 days, at his own cost ; \u2014 a service which, being thus rendered immediately to Fitz Alan, would seem inconsistent with the idea that the Copar ceners of Rodington had a mesne interest over Pagan de Sugdon. At the Assizes of 1267, John Mussot and Adam le Bere were found to have disseized Alice de Dammaur of Sogedon of a right of common-pasture in Sogedon.27 In March 12?4, we have Richard de Sogdon on a local Jury. In the year 1277, this Richard de Sugdon failed in a claim, against Geoffrey le Taylur and others, for a messuage and 3 acres in Ro dington. It appears that one Roger de Sugdon, from whom Richard derived his claim, had never been seized of the premises.28 In Easter Term 1282, Richard de Sugdon and his wife Alice (Im pedients in a Fine), acknowledge themselves to have given a mes suage and carucate in Sugdon to Hugh Burnel. The latter in turn concedes the premises to the Recognizors for their lives, to hold by payment of a rose-rent to himself, and by performance of all capital services. After their deaths the premises were to revert to Hugh and his heirs. On November 2, 1287, William Brid and Alice, his wife, give by Fine to Henry de Tyrley a messuage, 23 acres of land, and half an acre of meadow in Sugedon; to hold in fee at a rose-rent payable to the Grantors and the heirs of Alice, and by performance of all capital services. For this the Grantee gave a sore sparrow-hawk. The Inquest taken in July 1294, on the death of Philip Burnel, son and heir of Hugh above-mentioned, states him to have held lands in Suggedon under the Earl of Arundel, by service of doing suit every three weeks to the Court of Shrawardine.29 Again Edward Burnell died in 1315, seized of a messuage, 30 acres of land and 2 acres of meadow in Suggedon.30 Bolas Fee. The other moiety of Sugden was held immediately under Fitz Alan by those hereditary Foresters of Shropshire whose chief seat was at Bolas, and whose descent I have already adverted to under Cantlop.31 They again had their Feoffees here, the first of whom, viz. William son of Reginald de Rodinton, with assent of his wife and heirs, gives to Haghmon Abbey that half-virgate in Suggedon which John his brother held. The interest of the said 27 Assizes, 51 Hen.

Hugh fitz Robert's Confirmation is in substance as follows. \u2014 \" Sciant presentes et futuri quod ego Hugo filius Roberti, Fo restarius domini Regis, concessi et hac carta confirmavi Ecclesi\u00e6 de Haghmon, donacionem quam Willielmus heres de Rodinton fecit de una dimidia virgata terr\u00e6 in Suggedon quam Johannes tenuit, et donacionem quam Aliza filia ipsius Willielmi fecit de alia dimi dia, virgata in Einesbrugg quam Willielmus Wallensis tenuit.

I can trace this descent no further. The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 states as follows.\u2014 \" Suggedon is one hide and pays 4d. stretward and 4d. motfee. John fitz Hugh (he was of Bolas) is Lord of one moiety and Pagan de Suggedon of the other moiety ; and they hold it of the fee of John fitz Alan.\"33 Pagan's obligation to do ward at Oswestry is then stated, as I have given it above. I suppose the Grantor in the following Deed was the heir or as signee of John de Rodington, the Undertenant above-mentioned. \u2014 \" Richard son of William Sorlawe sells to William son of Hulger de Sugedon a messuage, curtilage and appurtenances in the vill of Sugedon, viz. that which Reginald Palmer formerly held ; \u2014 to hold to the Grantee, his successors, assigns, or legatees, under the Gran tor.

Perhaps it was included in the valuation of Upton Magna, which Manor precedes it in the Record. Before the end of Henry I.'s reign, Berwick was bestowed on a Feoffee. Who this Feoffee was I cannot suggest, for I cannot sup pose that Alan fitz Oliver, who, as we have seen,3 held Sundorn under Fitz Alan at the beginning of Henry II.'s reign, was also Fitz Alan's Tenant at Berwick. All that we know certainly of this matter is, that Henry Malveisin held a Muntator's fee of old feoffment in 1165-6, and in the Barony of Fitz Alan;3 and that the said fee was Berwick, \u2014 afterwards called Berwick Malvoisin, with reference to this tenure. It is probable too that Henry Malvoisin acquired Ber wick with his wife Avelina, whom I take to have been the heiress of some previous Lord of Berwick. Lastly Henry Malvoisin's son seems to have been eventually Alan fitz Oliver's heir, in respect of Sundorn. I am utterly at a loss to determine how Henry Malvoisin was related to that great House of Malvoisin which held Mavesyn Ridware and other Staffordshire Manors under Fitz Alan. How ever, it is from a Staffordshire Record that I gather something of the antecedents of the Berwick branch of the family. Henry Malvoisin was brother and heir of Nicholas Malvoisin, who, in the reign of Stephen, held Stallington (near Stone). Nicholas held that Manor under Ivo Pantulf in the first instance ; but the Sei gneury was afterwards changed, and Stephen de Buthlers, by some unknown process, came to occupy Ivo Pantulf's place. This will appear from a series of interesting Deeds which I now proceed to quote. \u2014 1. About the year 1150 \"Nicholas Malvesin informs his brethren and heirs that he has sold his land of Stalinton, to the Canons of Stone, for 7 merks, and for consideration that the said Canons had granted to him and his brethren the fraternity of their House.

Another Deed indicates the change of Seigneury above alluded to. \u2014 \" Stephen de Buthlers greets Walter (Durdent) , Bishop of Chester, and advises him that he has given Stalinton for the souls of his father and mother, and for the health of himself and his wife, to the Church of Stone ; \u2014 which (Stalinton) was of his fee. He has given it, as N. Malveisin and his brethren had sold it for 7 merks and 4 shillings.\" It was moreover certified by this Grantor that \" the aforesaid N. (Nicholas), to whose inheritance the said land pertained, had done homage to the Grantor for the same, and was bound to pay 5s. yearly (to the Grantor), in lieu of all services. But if perchance a quarrel should arise between the Grantor and any other, no more than the said 5s. wras to be required. For this (con firmation) the Canons paid 20s. to Stephen de Buthlers, and the following persons were witnesses of the transaction ; \u2014 viz. Maria, Stephen's wife ; Robert, his son ; Philip de Buthlers ; Leonius de Buthlers ; Ernulf, nephew (nepos) of Balduwin de Buthlers ; and others.\"4 The above three Deeds certainly passed before the year 1160. Stone Priory was subject to the Priory of Kenilworth, one of Henry II.'s Confirmation to the latter House, passed at Westminster, almost surely in the year 1164. It confirms among other things, \u2014 terram de Stallinton de dono Nicholai Mauveysin, et concessu Ste phani de Budlers, pro v solidis annuatim? Henry Malvoisin's feoffment at Berwick, however obtained, is illustrated in several ways. About the year 1175 he attests two Charters of William fitz Alan (II.) to Buildwas Abbey.6 Soon after he attests Alan de Hadley's Charter to Wombridge Priory :7 and about the vear 1190 he attests a confirmation of William fitz Alan (II.) to Haughmond Abbey.8 4 Cotton MSS.

By the first he gives to that Abbey certain tithes of his demesne of Berewick, viz. two-thirds of the tithes of his demesne, in wheat (garbis) and other things. He does this by concession of his wife, Avelina, and of his heirs. He also gives \" his son, to serve the Lord,\" that is, I suppose, his grant was accompanied by the recep tion of one of his children among the fraternity of Lilleshall. By a second Charter, Henry Malvesin bestows the same tithes on the Canons of Lilleshall, \" in whose House he has chosen that himself, his wife Avelina and his heirs should have burial \" (apud quos sepulturam, mihi, et heredibus, et uxori me\u00e6 Avelin\u00e6, eorum assensu elegi).9 Herbert Malvoisin, son and heir of Henry, appears at least as early as the year 1196, when we have seen him attesting a Charter to Wombridge Priory.10 At the Assizes of 1203 Herbert Malveisin was amerced half a merk, profalso dicto, having been apparently on some Jury which had made a false return. At the Assizes of November 1221, Sir Herbert Mauveisin appears not only as a Knight, and as a Juror to try causes of Grand Assize, but he was one of the four Coroners of Shropshire. Having en feoffed his son Thomas in half a virgate in Berewic, he was now called to warranty by the said Thomas, who had been impleaded for the same by Muriell fitz Helias. Herbert vouched the required warranty, stating that he had acquired the premises by gift of Alan Walsh, Muriell's former husband, who was seized thereof jointly with Muriell. This Muriell could not deny, so the Court dis missed the Suit, giving her leave to seek a remedy in some other form.11 The following Confirmation to Stone Priory passed before the year 1233. \u2014 \" Herbert Malveysin, with assent of Alan, his son and heir, concedes to the Priory, the Vill of Stalinton, which was of his inheritance, and which Nicholas Mauvesin his Uncle (avunculus), whose heir he was, sold to the said Priory, as his Charter did testify, and as the Charter of Stephen de Burlers did confirm it. For this concession, the Canons of Stone gave Herbert 24s. in the County- Court of Stafford.

On November 12, 1236, a Fine was levied at Shrews bury, which probably was a sequel to the Suit, above-mentioned under date of 1221. \u2014 Robert Corbechun and Murilda his wife (Plaintiffs) obtain a recognition from Thomas Mauveisin, that half a virgate held by him in Berewyk was the right of Murilda. In re turn the Plaintiffs concede half the premises (as bounded by the lands of Herbert Malveisin, etc.) to Thomas ; \u2014 to hold, under the Plaintiffs and the heirs of Murilda, at a rent of 7c?. Murilda here named was, I doubt not, the widow of Alan Walsh, now remarried to a second husband. The Feodaries of 1240 give Herbert Mauveisin as still holding half a knight's-fee in Berewik of the Barony of John Fitz Alan.13 His death must have taken place very soon after this. We have seen that he was Father of three sons, Alan, Henry, and Thomas. The eldest of these, viz. \u2014 Alan Malvoisin, cannot have survived his Father two years; for a Writ of March 5, 1242, apprises the Sheriff of Shropshire that Master Peter, Archdeacon of Salop, has obtained custody of the land and heirs of Alan Mauveysin for a Fine of 25 merks. The Archdeacon was to retain the said custody till the said heirs should be of age, and to dispose of them in marriage.1* It is obvious that this wardship had fallen to the Crown by reason of the cotemporary minority of the second John fitz Alan. In Michaelmas Term 1242, Master Peter de Radnor (the Archdeacon in question) was suing John Tece, for forcibly taking away the hay from a meadow which pertained to the land, late Alan Mauveysin' s, which land the Prosecutor had in custody.15 It appears that the Prior of Wenlock was John Tece's Principal in this matter, for later in the same Term the Prior appoints Brother Henry de Northamp ton, a Monk of Wenlock, to be his Attorney in Master Peter de Rad nor's Plea of trespass .16 In Hilary Term, 1243, the Prior justified his having abstracted the said hay vi et annis, on the ground that Alan (Malvoisin) had, two years before his death, demised the aforesaid meadow to the Prior. So the Prior was dismissed sine die.17 Saer Malvoisin, son and heir of Alan, was probably in possession of his estate in 1249, when we have seen him preceding his two presumed Uncles, Henry and Thomas, in the testing clause of a 13 Testa de Nevill, pp. 44, 47, 49. 14 Rot.

The Vill does suit every three weeks to the Hundred-Court, and it is geldable.\"19 At the Assizes of 1256, Seer de Berwick, as he is called, was one of the Jurors for Bradford Hundred. Among the presentments of this very Jury, Saer Mauveysin is entered as a Tenant of a whole knight's-fee, as of full age, and yet not a knight. Another Return of the same year makes him Tenant of 15 Librates of land, and yet not a knight. The Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 1259 registers Robert Mauveysin as having fined half a merk of gold for respite of knighthood. Here I suppose the Christian name of the recusant has been mistaken. The same Pipe-Roll gives Hugh de Cheny and Saer Mauveysin as jointly owing one merk for some Fine of the previous year. At the Forest- Assizes of February 1262, Saer Mauveysin's name appears on the list of Regarders for the Forest of Mount Gilbert, Wombridge, and Haughmond. The Verderers and Foresters of the County concurred with the Vills of Preston, Horton, Downton, Wappenshall, Kynnersley, and Muckleston in the following present ment, viz. that \" on Friday, May 23, 1253, Adam, a servant of Saer Mauveysin, had taken a stag in the King's Forest and had carried it to Saer's house, at Cotes,\"20 and that \" Saer had received it :\" \u2014 further that \" the said Saer had been imprisoned at Shrewsbury when Robert de Grendon was Sheriff.\" (This must have been in or before the year 1255.) It was now ordered (by the Court) that the Sheriff should compel Saer and Adam to appear. Several per sons who had failed to produce Richard de Wrocworthin, a partisan in the business, were pronounced in misericordid. \u2022 After awhile Saer appeared in Court, and was committed to prison ; but fined one merk (a kind of bail, I presume), his Sureties being John de Muneton and Hugh de Eton. So also did Adam fine half a merk, his Sure- 18 Supra, p. 278. have had, now or afterwards, at Cotes near Stafford, points to that locality as the one here alluded to. Possibly he had a resi dence at Coton Hill (formerly Cotes), near Shrewsbury. 19 Rot. Hundred. II. 56. 20 It is difficult to say what Cotes is hero meant.

Hence at the Assizes of Oc tober 1272, we find Agnes (another of Peter de Muneton's daughters) and her husband, Richard de Grynneshull, impleading Saer Mau vesyn aud his wife Alice, for disseizing them of one-third of an acre in Munyngton (Myndtown) . Saer and his wife pleaded that the King's Escheator had given them ingress, but the Plaintiffs recovered what they sought.23 I shall recur, under a more proper locality, to further notices of Saer Malvoisin's interest in Myndtown. It is very difficult, and, without a long search among Staffordshire Records, almost impossible, to decide what was the connection of the Malvoisins of Berwick with the Malvoisins of Cotes (near Stafford) . Nevertheless we are sure, from the following Deed, that Saer Malvoisin was Lord of Cotes ; for \u2014 \" Saer Mauveysin of Berewich grants to Sir William de Kavereswalle, Knight, all his Manor of Cotes-juxta- Stafford, for 40 merks.

It was to inquire what the deceased had held of the inheritance of his wife Alice, daughter of Peter de Muneton, and what of his own inheri tance. A second Writ issued from Worcester on November 26 following, and inquired what the deceased had held under John fitz Alan's heir (Richard), who was a Minor, in ward to the Crown. The Return to these inquiries bears date Dec. 15, 1283, and states, as regards Berewyk, that the deceased had held one carucate, etc., there, under Richard fitz Alan, for a whole knight's-fee ; and by service of Castle-guard at Oswestry, with one horseman, not heavily armed (non cooperto), for 40 days in time of war.

The Brad ford Tenure-Roll, of nearly the same date, repeats this statement, merely adding that the Manor was geldable. On a Forest Inquest of May 1292, Peter Mauveysin appears as one of the Foresters of Shropshire. The Writ of Diem clausit on his decease bears date at Ely on January 17, 1299. He died, seized, like his Father, of a tenure-in-capite at Myndtown, and seized also of Berwick, which he had held under Richard, Earl of Arundel.26 His son and heir \u2014 John Malvoisin was a Minor at his Father's decease. There appear to have been some doubts as to his exact age. The In quest on his Father's death, saying that he was aged 18 on Au gust 1, 1298, would make him to have been born on August 1, 1280; but this, as we shall see, was a misrepresentation, calcu lated to abridge the period of his wardship. A Writ of King Ed ward I., bearing date at Hereford on February 20, 1303, directs the Escheator to inquire whether \" John, son of Peter Mauveysin, born at Berewyk, and baptized in the Church of Aningeham (read Atingeham), who affirmed himself to be of full age,\" was really so.27 In consequence of this, one of those curious Inquests, called Probationes \u00e6tatis, was taken at Berewyk on March 1303. I will give in detail the evidence of the witnesses. 1. Henry de Garmeston, aged 60, deposed that John Mauveysin was born at Astleye-juxta-Berewyke, and baptized in the Church of St. Mary there, on August 6, 9 Edward I. (1281), so that he was of full age on August 6 last (1302). The Deponent knew this, because his own daughter Anable was born on All Saints' Day in the same year.28 2. Walter de Burton, aged 50, deposed to the same facts and dates. He knew them because his Son-in-law (filiolus), Stephen de Felton, was born in the same year with John Mauvesyn, and had proved his age in the current year, before John de la Lee, under whom he held certain tenements.29 3. Richard Braz, aged 40, gave similar evidence. He remem bered, because in King Edward's ninth year he purchased the corn- 26 Inquisitions, 27 Edw. I., No. 20.

Henry del Ree, aged 44, recollected the fact, because his own Father died in the year preceding John Mauveysin's birth. 5. William Payn, aged 43, recollected the date, because he was himself married in the year following the said John's birth. 6. Roger Fox, aged 52, had a son Reginald born in the same year with John Mauveysin, and so remembered the date. 7. Geoffrey de Morton, aged 47, recollected the same, because, in the year of John Mauveysin's birth, he went to live with Sir Robert Corbet, at Morton, where he still lives, and in passing through Astley he heard of the said birth. 8. Hugh de Norton, aged 52, had a daughter Petronilla, born in the same year with John Mauveysin. 9. John Robylots, aged 44, was serving his uncle Godefrid, a Chaplain, who died in that year. 10. John Russell of Donynton, aged 43, was living in that year with a certain Sir Thomas Boterel, whose son John died in the same year. John Mauveysin seems to have died in 1323, but the Escheator, who had been ordered to seize his lands, being removed from office before he could do so, a supplementary Writ of January 18, 1324, resulted in an Inquest, held at Shrewsbury, on May 16 following. It appeared that John Mauvesyn, of Berewyk juxta Attingham, besides his tenure-in-capite at Muneton, had held Berewyk under the Earl of Arundel, by service of finding one guard at Oswestry Castle, for 20 days, in the time of any Welsh war. The Capital messuage was worth 8<i. and 18 acres of land yielded 6s. per an num. The assized rents were Is. 5c?. John, son and heir of the deceased, was aged 19 years on August 15, 1323.31 John Malvoisin (II.) appears, by a Writ of April 20, 1326, to have petitioned the Crown for livery, as being no longer in mino rity. An Inquest, held at Shrewsbury in July following, repeats most of the facts stated in 1324, but values the capital messuage of Berewick at Is., because the buildings were in a ruinous state. The Mauveysin Estates had been in manu Regis since Dec. 8, 1323. This Inquest states John Mauveysin to have attained the age of 21 on Sept. 8, 1325, substituting the Nativity of the Virgin as his 31 Inquisitions, 17 Edw. II., No. 48. 30 That is, he farmed the great tithes of Upton Magna in that year."], [444, "396 BERWICK MALVOISIN, NOW BERWICK MAVISTON. birthday instead of the Assumption of the Virgin, as given in the first Inquest.32 For some further particulars of the Malvoisins of Berwick I refer elsewhere ;33 though I cannot think it probable that the male line continued here so late as the reign of Henry IV. ; for in 21 Richard II. (1397-8) we see on good authority that Richard Otley was holding half a knight's-fee in Berewyk Mauvesyn under the Earl of Arundel.34 I will not attempt even to enumerate the various families of Malvoisins which were flourishing in Shropshire and Staffordshire in the thirteenth century ; much less will I offer any theory as to their original connection. This however is the fittest place I can select for showing how one of these families was an offshoot of the Ber wick branch. \u2014 Henry Malvoisin, probably the second son of Herbert Malvoi sin of Berwick, was, in the same ratio of probability, of full age in 1221. We have seen him attesting a Deed about the year 1249.35 Perhaps, seven years later than this, we have \" Henry Mauveysin of Berwick and Thomas his brother \" following \" Saer de Berwick\" (their presumed nephew) in the attestation of a Wombridge Charter. We also learn, from another Wombridge Deed, that Henry Mauveysin of Berwick was Tenant of a share of the Mill of Uppington, having been enfeoffed therein before 1243, and dying seized thereof after 1255. Now I have good reason for thinking that this Henry Malvoisin was the identical person who has already been spoken of, as having been grantee of a virgate-and-half in Ashfield in the year 1252, and as holding that estate in 1255. 36 I further think that this Henry had two sons, Thomas and Philip, and that it was the for mer who, as \u2014 Thomas, son of Henry Mauvesyn, sold lands in Cotes (Dear Stafford) to Stephen Goldsmith of Stafford.37 Again, we have Thomas Mauveisin as Juror on a Rodington Inquest in January 1274 ; and Thomas de Berewyk as Juror on a Woodcote Inquest in 1278. In 1292 we have* seen, under Ashfield, that Thomas de Berewyk was dead. In the account there given, it was made to appear that the 32 Inquisitions, 20 Edw.

An Antiquary of the last century, who had an estate in this Parish, tells us in somewhat pompous style that \" the Constantines were originally Vassals of the Earls Montgomery, but afterwards of the Fitz Alans of Gun-Castle.\"3 Whatever of this may be true as regards the Constantines and their Norman antecedents, I do not find that they, or their presumed ancestor, Radulf, ever held any thing immediately under the Palatine Earls. The Fitz Alans, or their Predecessors, or else the Barons of Pulverbatch, were Mesne lords of every Shropshire estate, in which the Constantines appear to have acquired any interest. Passing from Radulf and Hugh de Constantine to Helyas de Constantine, who was head of the family in 1165, 1 should say that his tenure of Eaton represented only one-half of the feoffment (of one knight and two muntators) which he then held in Fitz Alan's erat Comitum Montegomericorum ; pos tea vero Alanidarum de Coloniaco Cas tello.\" (Vita Willielmi Baxteri a seipso conscripta : inter Reliquas Baxterianas.) 1 Domesday, so. 254, b, 1. 3 Supra, Vol. I. pp. 133 et seqq. 3 \" Constantinorum Familia a primis Normannorum temporibus in clientele fu- 1 VIII."], [454, "2 EATON CONSTANTINE. Barony.1 It was in fact held by service of half a knight's fee. Richard de Constantine, the successor of Helyas, was deceased in 1196, when he was represented by his son, \u2014 Thomas de Constantine (I.). Of this Thomas and his wife Isabel, sister and eventual coheir of Robert de Girros, I have spoken under Burwarton, and under Broughton.3 I find him amerced one merk for trespass, in 1203. Soon after this a Perambulation was ordered to be made between the lands of Thomas de Constantine and the King's Forest. A Jury of twelve Knights seems to have been empanelled for the occasion, and to have discharged the duty with partiality. Hence at the Forest Assizes of March 1209, we find the justiciars ordering the names of these Jurors to be returned into Court, and commanding Guy Venator and the Verderers \"to seize the land of Thomas de Costentin and also his bosc, which bosc had by falsehood of a jury (per falsam juratam) been abstracted from the Forest.\" The Pipe-Roll of 1212 shows that the Knights- Jurors who were concerned in this affair were amerced in the enormous penalty of 100 merks and 2 palfreys, and that the whole debt, except \u00a33, had been paid. Thomas de Constantine's forfeiture on this occasion was probably reversed for some less serious consi deration, but we are not surprised to find him afterwards in rebel lion against King John, and his estates at Eaton and Oldbury granted to John fitz Philip by the same Writ as that which confis cated the lands of his neighbour at Leighton.3 About this time Thomas de Constantine made an extensive feoffment to Robert de Woodcote, his neighbour at Eye. The particulars I will give in a future chapter. On November 3, 1217, the Sheriff of Shropshire is certified by a Writ of King Henry III. that Thomas de Constantine had returned to his allegiance.*1 An Inquest of the year 1220 exhibits Thomas de Constantine as one of the Verderers of the Shropshire Forests. At the Assizes of 1221 he appears as a Knight, sitting on Juries of Grand Assize. He was himself subjected to damages of 10 merks for having disseized one Richard fitz Geoffrey of a free tenement in Etton. His securities in this matter were Hugh de Upton, Herbert Manveisin, Robert fitz Aer, and Walter de Hugeford. A Writ of October 2, 1224, exempts Thomas de Constantine, as a Verderer, from serving on Juries and Assizes.5 In 1231, Thomas de Constantine was amerced 20s. \" because his hounds had coursed 1 Liber Niger, I. p. 143. 3 Supra, Vol. III. pp. 32, 33, 78, 79. 3 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 329. 4 * 5 Claus.

An occurrence of 1237, associating him with Sir Richard de Leigh ton, has been already noticed -1 but whether it was he or his son Thomas who is registered about 1240 as holding a knight's-fee in Eton and Oldbury under Fitz Alan, I cannot say. It will appear elsewhere that Thomas de Constantine (I.) had four brothers, viz. Helias, William, Ralph, and Richard ; but I here proceed to speak of his son and heir, viz., Thomas de Constantine (IL), who between the years 1244 and 1250 appears as a Knight and as a frequent witness of local Char ters. In 1251, we have seen this Thomas de Constantine recog nized as one of the coheirs of Robert de Girros.3 He was in fact his nephew, the son of his sister Isabel. The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 describes the status of Eaton as follows. \u2014 \" Heton, a Manor of two hides, pays 8d. motfee and 8d. stretward. Thomas de Costantin holds Heton as Lord, for a knight's fee, and of the fief of John fitz Alan. The Manor does ward at White-Minster (Oswestry) by service of one knight for 40 days, in war-time, at the knight's own cost. It also does due suit to County and Hundred, and is geldable.\"3 At the Assizes of 1256, Thomas de Constantine appears in vari ous capacities, viz. as nephew and coheir of Robert de Girros, as a Knight empanelled to try causes of Grand Assize, and as one of the four Coroners of Shropshire. In June 1259 he is the first-named of a number of Knights who sat on a Forest-Inquest at Sheriff Hales, and this seems to be his latest appearance in public life. In November 1268 I find Adam de Montgomery (his son-in-law) fining 20s. \" for license to accord in a plea of convention with Thomas de Costentin.\" The Fine which resulted was levied at Bristol on January 14, 1269. Thereby Thomas de Costentin, Deforciant, ac knowledged that the Manors of Aldeby (Oldbury) and Etone and half the Manor of Fyttes (Fitz) were the right of Adam de Mun gomery and his wife Isabella, Plaintiffs in a Plea of convention. In turn, Adam and Isabella conceded the premises to Thomas, for his life, to hold under themselves at a rent of Id., or a pair of white gloves. The premises were then to revert to Adam and Isabella, to hold of the Lords of the respective fees ; but if Adam and Isa bella died without heirs, the heir of Adam was to inherit. 1 * \u25a0 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 329; IV. p. 22.

Thomas de Constantine was still living in October 1277 ; but, having nothing further to say of him, I proceed to speak of \u2014 Adam de Montgomery, whom we have seen attesting a Chetton Deed1 at the precise period when the above Fine was levied. At the Assizes of 1272 Sir Adam de Montgomery was one of the Jurors who tried several causes of Grand Assize, and on March 2nd of that year Robert, his only son by Isabella de Constantine, ap pears to have been bom. Two Feodaries, drawn up about 1284, concur in giving Adam de Montgomery as Lord of Eaton Con stantyne, and as holding the same under Richard fitz Alan, by ser vice of one knight's-fee. On May 18, 1285, Adam de Montgomery obtained a Charter of Free Warren in his Manors of Eton-Con stantyn, Fittes, Sandford, and Borewarton.3 On the death of Sir Adam de Montgomery, which, as I have stated under Burwarton, took place in 1290, his tenure of Eaton Constantine, Oldbury, a moiety of Fitz, and of land at Sandford (near Knokin), is duly re corded. All these estates were held of the Barony of Fitz Alan, and all had devolved to him by his second marriage with Isabella de Constantine. His heir in respect of the Manor of Lydham was his son Thomas, who, having been 30 years of age at Christmas 1289, was of course his son by a former wife. Robert, his son by Isabella de Constantine, was still in minority.3 I have inadvertently stated under Burwarton that Isabella de Constantine died before her husband. The Assize-Roll of October 1292 disproves this in two ways. In the first place it records that Edmund de Mortimer is indebted in a sum of \u00a37 to Alexander de Montgomery, and to Isabel, widow of Adam de Montgomery, which Alexander and Isabel were Executors of the said Adam's Will. In the next place it exhibits the Earl of Arundel, as Custos of Adam de Montgomery's heir, rendering her thirds to Isabel, Adam de Montgomery's Widow. These thirds were, \u2014 a third of 2 carucates of land, 10 acres of bosc, one Weir and 100s. rent in Eton Costen tyn, \u2014 of 2 carucates of land and 11 merks rent in Oldbury, \u2014 and of 1 carucate of land, 10 acres of bosc, and 40s. rent in Fytisho (Fitz).4 It is not easy to understand how only a third of these estates ac crued to Isabella.

It appears that her son \u2014 Robert de Montgomery, died without issue. In the Nomina Villarum of 1316, William de Leghton is enrolled as Lord of Eton Constantyn. I cannot account for this, except on the supposition that William de Leighton had married Adam de Montgomery's Widow. Another difficulty now presents itself. After the deaths of Isa bella de Constantine and her son Robert, we should, according to the remainder fixed by the Fine of 1269, expect to see Eaton pass ing to the heirs of Adam de Montgomery. I have no proof of such a result. I will not however here inquire how one Maculine is stated to be Lord of Eaton Constantine in 1331, or how the Manor afterwards passed to the Thornhills. Of Undertenants in this Manor, I may name John de Con stantine of Eaton, who occurs on a local Jury in July 1278, and also in the years 1298, 1300, 1302, 1304 and 1312. In December 1298 William le Despenser and William Fisher of Eaton occur on a Berwick Jury. In September 1331, W alter le Spenser and John Constantyn, both of Eton, attest a Wombridge Charter. Lilleshall Fee. In the time, as I think, of Henry III., Ro bert de Constantine gave to Lilleshall Abbey half a virgate and a capital messuage in the vill of Ettun, which had been held by his father. He also gave 7d. rent to the same, viz. Id. arising from an assart near Foleford, 4d. from a house near the capital messuage, and 2d. from two acres of land, one of which is described as lying near The Stanibrug1 The Canons are held to pay a chief-rent of \\2d., due on this tenement, which I take to have been the estate of a younger branch of the Constantines. In November 1265, Henry III.'s confirmation to Lilleshall describes the above grant as dona cionem et concessionem quas Robertus Constentyn fecit de una vir gatd terr\u0153 cum pertinentiis in Gatton Constentyn. I find no later proof of the Abbey continuing in possession of this estate. THE CHURCH. That this was a Chapel, originally dependent upon Leighton Church, I have already given proof.3 The antiquity of its founda tion is however considerable, whether we judge from the Norman Font, which is still preserved, or from the fact, that Walter Chap- 1 Lilleshall Chartulary, so. 76. | - Supra, Vol. VII. p. 337."], [458, "6 EATON CONSTANTINE. lain of Eton appears early in the thirteenth century attesting a Charter of Thomas de Constantine.1 The Taxation of 1291 gives the Church of Eton Constantine (in the Deanery of Salop) as worth only 30s. per annum.3 In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth rated this Parish at 10s., and no more, because it was small and poor, and because there had been a general murrain among the sheep.3 The Valor of 1534-5 combines the account of this Free Chapel, as it is called, with that of the Collegiate Churches of St. Chad and St. Mary, Shrewsbury, I cannot account for this association. Eton Constantyne was now worth only \u00a31. 6s. 2c.. per annum to its Incumbent.4 EARLY INCUMBENTS. On January 31, 1301 this Chapel was vacant and under Episco pal sequestration. Bishop Langton commits the custody of such sequestration to \u2014 Richard son of William le Despenser of Eton, till Michael mas next. On December 27, 1349, the presentation to this bene fice had lapsed to the Bishop. He collated \u2014 William Tandy, Chaplain, thereto. Tandy seems to have held this Church for a few weeks in conjunction with Little Build was.5 He resigned Eaton on March 29, 1350, and on June 15 fol lowing \u2014 Hugh Boldyng, Chaplain, was admitted here at the presentation of Sir Walter de Hopton, Lord of Eaton Constantine. The Pre sentee was bound by oath to resign, if any trouble should accrue to the Bishop in consequence of this institution. I presume the right of Sir Walter de Hopton to present was in question, and I cannot account for his being Lord of the Manor. Boldyng, as we have seen, came hither from Little Buildwas.6 On June 24, 1384, Hugh Boldyng, Rector of the Church of Eyton Costantyn, quit-claims to William Corbronde of Uppington all right which he had to a mes suage in Uppington by gift of John Golde of Uppington.7 William Opynton, Priest, was instituted to this Chapel on January 16, 1393, at the presentation of Richard Thornhull and Florence his wife.

This gift, which probably dates before Fitz Alan's expulsion from Shropshire in 1138, is not embodied in any original charter, known to be extant, but is thus described in Henry III.'s Confirmation to Combermere.

On William fitz Alan's restoration to his Shropshire estates in 1155, he seems to have enfeoffed Hamo le Strange in the residue of this Manor.1 Of Hamo le Strange, Lord of Cheswardine by gift of Henry IL, and of Betton Strange by feoffment of the Abbot of Shrews bury, I have spoken more than once.2 At Michaelmas 1160 he was deceased without legitimate issue. The short period during which he held Little Ercall was distinguished by his grant of Nag ingtou, a member thereof, to Haughmond Abbey. This grant was forthwith confirmed by William fitz Alan (I.) as Lord of the Fee, and in the following terms : \u2014 Willielmus filius Alani omnibus hominibus suis, presentibus et futuris, salutem. Notum sit omnibus vobis me dedisse, in perpetuam elemosynam, Nagintonam Deo et Sancto Johanni Hamonensis Ec clesie, et Canonicis ejusdem Ecclesi\u00e6, pro salute anime mee et ante cessorum meorum et pro salute anime Hamonis Extranei, qui illam priits eidem Ecclesie, pro salute anime sue, divisit ,* \u2014 liberam et quietam ab omni servicio quod ad me vel meos pertineat ; \u2014 liberam dico et in pasturd communii et in bosco et in piano et in aquis et in semitis. Hiis testibus Johanne Extraneo, Widone Extraneo, En gelardo, Willielmo filio Odonis, etc? On the death of Hamo le Strange, his eldest brother, John, was undoubtedly his heir-at-law, but \u2014 Ralph le Strange, the younger brother of both, was permitted to succeed to Little Ercall, obviously with the concurrence of John, and without any cotemporary limitation of his tenure, such as, ac cording to feudal usage, would have made him Tenant-in-fee, and made John Mesne-Lord, at least, of Little Ercall. This compro mise of a principle, led, as we shall see, to after-litigation between the heirs of John and Ralph ; but the matter was kept in abeyance for a time. Hence it is that, in the Liber Niger of 1165, Ralph le Strange appears as holding half a knight's-fee of new feoffment, im mediately under Fitz Alan.4 The half- fee was undoubtedly Little Ercall, but subsequent Records prove that it should have been added to the two fees which John le Strange is stated to have held of the same Barony, and that Ralph's name, he being de jure, only an Undertenant of John, should not have appeared at all. 1 On a former page (Vol. V. p. 253) I identified Hugh de Lacy's Manor of Ark hulle with Childs Ercall.

The land is described as extending \" from the Fishery of Richard, Lord of Cherrington, up to the Ford.\"1 This Ralph appears to have had some feoffment in the Norfolk Manor of Litcham; but I doubt his being the person who was called Ralph le Strange de Lucheham? A cotemporary of that name follows Guy le Strange, in attesting a grant of John le were usually called \" of Litcham,\" are quite fragmentary. The elder House of Le Strange (that of Ness) retained in the 13th century a great estate in Lit cham, and there are several instances of a Strange of Ness portioning a younger child in land at Litcham. But the Stranges who were distinguished as \" of Litcham \" were according to Blomefield descended from Durandus, son of Ralph, sou of Siward. Nor was this Durandus le Strange an imaginary person. I know him to have been cotemporary with John, Guy, Hamo, and Ralph, \u2014 the four brethren who settled in Shropshire be tween 1154 and 1160 ; but how Roland le Strange, the father of these four bre thren, was related to Siward, the grand father of Durandus, I have never been able to discover. 1 Monasticon, VI. p. 390. 2 In 4 John (1202-3) Philip de Burn ham aud Emma his wife were implead ing Fulk d'Eiry and Maud his wife for a moiety of East Winch and for certain messuages in Litcham and Ringsted.

But I have no doubt that it was Ralph le Strange of Ercall who had a feoffment in Hunstanston, Norfolk, from his brother John, and who, after John's death (in 1178-9) granted Hunstans ton-Mill to Haghmon Abbey. The following Charter1 certainly passed between 1182 and 1194, and I give it entire because of its important bearing on the early genealogy of the family of Le Strange : \u2014 Omnibus sancte Dei ecclesie filiis tarn presentibus quam futuris Radulphus Extraneus salutem.

It is probable that his son Roland, mentioned in the above Deed, was his only son, and died in Ralph's lifetime, in fact was dead at the date of the above Deed. It is certain that Ralph le Strange of Ercall was succeeded by two daughters and coheirs, one of whom, Matilda, was the wife of Fulk d'Oirri, while the other, Emma, was married to Philip de Burnham. These facts are illustrated by a long series of litigation which now ensued. On June 6, 1194, Fulk de Oiri presented himself before the Courts at Westminster as suing Hugh de Say of Stokes (Stoke upon Tern) for two parts of the bosc of Renhal. The Defendant neither appeared, nor was he essoigned, so that the Court ordered that the said two parts should 1 Haghmon Chartulary, so. 124 dorso. Strange may have been enfeoffed in both Mills.

His Essoign was that known as de malo veniendi and William Franc was his Essoignor? I hear nothing more of this suit, which per haps was unsettled at the time of Hugh de Say's death, not three years later. In Easter Term 1198 a Suit was pending between Fulk de Oirri and Philip de Burnham, as husbands of Matilda and Emma, daughters of Ralph le Strange. It related to their shares of Ralph's inheritance. The Court decided that a partition, to which the parties had agreed before the Archbishop of Canterbury, should now be made; \u2014 saving to the husband of the elder Sister, the esnecy, and saving to both parties their reasonable costs.3 Norfolk is the only county named with reference to this cause, but Shropshire was undoubtedly con cerned. The matter remained unsettled in May 1199, when Fulk d'Oirri was beyond sea, in the service of the Earl of Albemarle.4 But the suit most illustrative of feudal usages was that whereby John le Strange (II.) , as heir of his Uncle Hamo, endeavoured to establish those mesne rights at Ercall on which we have seen that his Father had never insisted. He sued each of the Coparceners under Writ of mort d'ancestre for a fourth part of a knight's fee in Arkelau ; \u2014 by which I understand that he sued for the services and seigneury of each moiety of the Manor, not for the fee-simple. The suit against Fulk and Matilda de Oirri was settled by the following verdict of a Jury on April 23, 1200, viz. that Hamo, John's Uncle, had died seized of the said fourth part of a fee in Arkelau, and that John was Hamo's next heir. The Court accordingly decided that John should recover his seizin. John le Strange's correspondent suit against Philip and Emma de Burnham had commenced in May 1195, was renewed in Atfgust 1199, and was still unsettled in October 1208, owing to the shifts and essoigns of Phibp de Burnham.5 The result we know to have 1 Placita incerti temporis Regis Ricardi, No. 62, memb. 2.

Fuller particulars of Fulk d'Oirri and his family are, I apprehend, to be gathered from other counties than Shropshire. At Holebech in Lincolnshire I know him to have had an interest.1 In May 1215 he joined in the short-lived disaffection of the Earl of Albe marle. On March 5, 1216, Fulco de Oyry gives up Geoffrey his son and Fulco his nephew or grandson (nepotem), as hostages for his good conduct, and fines 500 merks for the King's favour. The King accordingly orders the Sheriffs of Lincolnshire, Norfolk and Suffolk, Shropshire, and Hampshire, to restore his lands.3 It seems that John le Strange (II.) had made the most of his Tenant's dis affection, by seizing his share of Ercall. However on January 5, 1217, King Henry III. orders John le Strange to restore to \"our faithful Fulk d'Oiry, his land of Erkal, which was of Le Strange's Fee, and whereof Le Strange had disseized the said Fulk, as an ad herent of the Earl of Albemarle.\"3 I have not been able to ascertain whether it was by descent from Burnham or from D'Oiry that Elyas de Fancourt succeeded to a moiety of Little Ercall. About the years 1230-40, Elyas de Fan court mortgaged, according to one account, but gave, according to another, his share of the Manor to Combermere Abbey. Nearly at the same period the other moiety fell by some means, to me un known, into the hands of John le Strange (III.) , as Mesne-Lord. Elyas de Fancourt died while the term which he had granted to Combermere Abbey was still current. He left a son, Gerard, who, being in minority and a tenant by Knight's-service under John le Strange, fell to the custody of that Baron. Le Strange first seized upon Fancourt's moiety of Ercall, but afterwards demised it to Combermere Abbey (together, I think, with the other moiety), for a term, and for a sum of money. Of the Feodaries of 1240 one says that John le Strange holds Middle, and Little-Ercall under Fitz Alan for 2 fees, another that he holds the same by 2\\ fees.4 The last is undoubtedly the more correct statement, but John le Strange's tenure by 2\\ fees involved many more Manors than the .two thus specified. The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 shows the Abbot of Com bermere as in possession of the whole of Ercall, but the mode in 1 Vide Abbrev. Placitorum, p. 97. - Rot. Finium, p. 582. 3 Rot. Claus.

The statement of the Hundred-Roll is sub stantively as follows. \u2014 \" Hercalewe Parva, a Manor of 2 hides, pays 8c.. for motfee, and 8c.. for stretward. The Abbot of Cumbermere holds a moiety of the vill by gift of E Has de Fanecin, and the other half, for a term, of John le Strange, paying 5 merks per annum to the said John. And he (the Abbot) finds one horseman, with a hauberk, a chapel-de-fer, and a lance, in time of war, for forty days at his own cost : and he does suit to the Hundred every three weeks ; and holds half a knight's-fee. In the same fee Geoffrey Griffin (he was former Lord of Howie) made a certain pourpres ture, three acres in extent, which he bought from Fulk Douli (D'Oiry) twenty years ago: and it lies barren (frisca).\"1 Soon after this, John le Strange (III.) made over to his son Ro ger, \"whatever he had in Ercall,\" by which expression I under stand, not the mesne-lordship, which in fact could not be thus alie nated, but such reversionary rights to the fee-simple as would accrue whenever the Abbot of Combermere's term or terms expired. It seems that on the arrival of that period Roger le Strange took peaceable possession of one moiety, but was obliged to eject the Abbot from Fancourt's moiety. Hence in Easter-Term 1263 we find the Abbot suing the said Roger for half the Manor of Parva Erkalewe, as sometime the seizin of a former Abbot, William de Waresley. The Defendant of course called his father to warranty.3 It is evident that this suit was suspended during the period of poli tical convulsion which now set in. In Easter Term 1271 it had assumed a new form, and was an action of Quare impedit, brought by Roger le Strange against the Prior of Combermere (the Abbacy being, I presume, vacant) ? In the same term I find Robert de Caumpeden, Prior of Combermere, naming an Attorney in a plea of land and of Quare impedit, against Roger le Strange.4 The cause eventually tried at the Assizes of October 1272, shows the new Abbot of Combermere suing Roger le StraDge for half the Manor of Parva Erkalue, the Advowson of the Church excepted, into which half Roger was alleged to have had no ingress save at a time when the Abbey was vacant after the decease of William de Waresley, a preceding Abbot.

Elyas de Fanacurt, his Father's Feoffee by knight's service, had mortgaged the said moiety, for a term, to Robert, a former Abbot of Combermere : that on the death of the said Elyas, John le Strange, as Custos of his infant heir, Gerard, seized the premises, but afterwards demised them (for the residue of the heir's minority) to the Abbot, for a sum of money : \u2014 that then John le Strange made over his remaining interests in Ercall to the Defendant, Ro ger, who now insisted that Abbot Robert's only interest had been in the nature of mortgage or of wardship. The Abbot replied that his Predecessor, Robert, had been enfeoffed by Elyas de Fanacurt ; that Abbot William had been seized of the premises ; \u2014 and that Roger le Strange had intruded himself therein. The Juror found for Roger le Strange, saying that Elyas de Fanacurt had never en feoffed Abbot Robert.1 Roger le Strange thus became Tenant-in-fee of Little Ercall, holding the same by service of half a knight's fee, under his elder brother, John le Strange (IV.) of Nesse and Cheswardine. It will have been this Roger le Strange who is recorded to have given to Wombridge Priory 4 acres of his waste in Erchelewe.3 The gift was doubtless in augmentation of the estate which the Canons had at Cherrington. For some cause or other, an extent of Roger le Strange's estates at Cheswardine, Childs Ercall, and Ellesmere, was taken in October 1280. The Commissioners only valued a moiety of Erkalewe as belonging to Sir Roger le Strange. I cannot explain this. Sir Roger's gross receipts from the said moiety were 15s. 8c?. per an num. Thomas Bosse, tenant of half a virgate, and William de la Leye, paying 4s. rent for a virgate in Leye, were among the Feoffees.3 The Feodaries of 1284-6 make Roger le Strange to be Lord of Little Ercall and its members, viz. Atton (Hungry Hatton), Leyes (The Lee), and Golston (Goldstone). They further describe him as holding under John le Strange, \u2014 meaning John le Strange (V.) of Nesse, &c, who was his Nephew. But one of these Feodaries in correctly states the tenure to be a whole knight's-fee, and both are wrong in classing John le Strange's tenure as immediate under the Crown. Fitz Alan was still Seigneural Lord. At the Assizes of 1292, Roger le Strange, Thomas Bosse, and William de la Leye 1 Assizes, 56 Hen.

Roger le Strange, of whom I have been speaking, though a younger son, was a successful and a great man. Dugdale has said much of him as Lord of Ellesmere and Cheswardine, as Sheriff of Yorkshire, and as Justice of the Forests South of Trent.1 I have made or shall have to make mention of him in some of these or in other capacities. He had summonses to Parliament as a Baron in 1295 and 1296. For a list of his military and civil em ployments, commencing in 1277 and ending in 1303, I refer else where.3 In February 1300 as \" Rogerus Lestrange Dominus de Elles mere\" he joined in the well-known letter of the Barons of England to Pope Boniface VIII. He died on July 31, 1311, but the King having had a false re port of his death had issued a writ of Diem clausit six days before. It is all but certain that he died without lawful issue. His wife had been Maud, widow of that Roger de Moubray who died in 1266-7. This Maud was coheiress of the Barony of Beauchamp of Bedford, and by courtesy of England, her second husband, Roger le Strange, enjoyed her estates for his life. On his death the In quest states that \" the heir of the said Maud was her son John de Moubray, son and heir of Roger de Moubray.\" John de Mou bray was however her grandson, i.e. son of her son Roger. He was now 22 years of age and upwards.3 John le Strange of Ercall, as he was called, appears to have ob tained an interest at Childs Ercall long before Roger le Strange's death, but I have no proof how he was related to Roger. He sat as a Knight of the Shire in several parliaments of 1305, 1306, 1307, and 1309, being always styled \" of Ercall.\" The Feodary of 1316 gives the Earl of Arundell as Lord of Ercall, which looks as if the Manor, or part of it, was at that time an Escheat. By some means or other John le Strange of Cheswardine (so called in 1306) became John le Strange of Cheswardine and Ercall. He was illegitimate, as we have already seen.4 He lived till 1330. It then appeared that he had settled Cheswardine by Fine, on 4 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 282. I have no doubt that Roger le Strange was father of this John, if not also of the John who preceded him at Ercall. 1 Baronage, I. p. 666, b. 2 Parliamentary Writs, I. 849, 850 IV. 1471. 3 Inquisitions, 5 Edw.

But it is not less clear that John de Leybourn, aged 30, was found to be right heir of John le Strange, viz. son of his sister Lucia.1 And John de Leybourn seems actually to have inherited what ever John le Strange had at Ercall; for immediately after the death of the latter, that is on October 20, 1330, a Fine was levied between John de Leybourne and Beatrix his wife (Plaintiffs) and Hugh Burnel aud Thomas de Wynnesbury, junior (Deforciants) of the Manor of Berewyk and half the Manor of Childes-Ercalwe. John de Leybourne first acknowledges Hugh Burnel's right to the premises by his (Leybourne' s) gift. Hugh and Thomas then settle the premises on John and Beatrix, and the heirs of their bodies; with remainder to the right heirs of John ; to hold of the Lords of the Fee. By agreement dated January 20, 1339, John de Leybourne, \" Lord of Childes Ercalewe,\" conceded to the Abbot of Haugh mond and his tenants at Nagington, certain common rights in the Heath between Childs Ercall, Tibberton, and Caynton.3 Dodicote. \u2014 We have seen how this member of Little Ercall passed to Combermere Abbey by grant of William fitz Alan (I.). Thenceforward it became a separate Manor and requires a distinct account. In October 1199 the Abbot of Cumbermare had a suit of novel disseizin against Fulk de Oirri, in which Bernard, a Monk of his House, was his Attorney.3 In October 1200 and April 1201, the Plea-Rolls contain allu sions to a suit between the Abbot of Combermere and Richard de Lecton (Plaintiff) concerning land in Dodecot. The deposition of the existing Abbot, Thomas, caused a remanet sine die, but I find the matter settled, by a Fine of October 13, 1201. Thereby Richard de Lechton (Plaintiff) quitclaims half a hide in Dodecote, to Thomas Abbot of Cumbermare (Tenant) and his Successors for ever. The Abbot paid 100s. The earliest Shropshire Inquisition, that is extant, concerns this locality. On May 7, 1220, King Henry III., then at Shrewsbury, desires John Mareschall (then Justice of the Forest) to make In quest, by the Foresters and Verderers and by oath of twelve men of the vicinage of Bradford, as to the acreage of certain land called Ruecroftes, which lay between Tiberton and Hule (Howie) and which the Combermere Monks wanted to bring into cultivation. 1 Inquisitions, 4 Edw.

NAGINGTON. 17 The Inquest was further to state what was growing on the land, whether thick timber or underwood, and whether its cultivation would injure the King's Forest of Wombridge. The Inquest was to be returned to Hubert de Burg, Justiciar, before the Quinzaine of John the Baptist (July 8, 1220) ? Hence we know the date of the, itself undated, Inquest which resulted. John Marescal for warded the King's Writ to Henry de Audley (then Deputy-Sheriff to Ranulf Earl of Chester) .' Audley held the Inquest and enclosed it in a Letter to Hubert de Burg, Justice of England. The per sons who officiated were Hugh fitz Robert, Forester ; Thomas de Constantine and Hamo Marescot, Verderers ; and twelve Bradford Jurors whom I shall name in other chapters. They reported that the Monks' proposition would be non-injurious to the King's Forest, that neither thick timber nor underwood grew on the land, but only heath.3 On receipt of this Inquest the King addressed a mandate to John Marescall allowing the Monks to clear the said land, viz. 20 acres. John Marescall forwarded the Writ to the Sheriff of Shropshire, and before the Assizes of November 1221 the Monks of Combermere had cleared 3 or 4 acres of the land in question. At those Assizes the Abbot and another were sued by Fulk d'Oiry for disseizing him of common pasture in Arcalun. The Abbot showed that the few acres cleared were Forest-land of the King's, and ap pealed to the above Writs and Inquest. The Court decided to give judgment at Westminster in Hilary Term following. In 1255 the Bradford Hundred-Roll says most accurately that \" the Abbot of Combermere holds Dotecote by gift of William fitz Alan, in pure almoign, and that it is not hidated.\" An Inquisi tion seems to have been taken in 1286, relative to the Abbot of Combermere disforesting a grove (nemus) at Dodecote, which was within the Forest of Mount Gilbert ; but the document is lost. In 1291, the Abbot's estate here is estimated at 2 carucates, each yield ing 10s. per annum? The Valor of 1534-5 gives the Abbot's Rents and Temporalities at Dodcote as \u00a34. 6s. 8c?.

The Feo daries err^^Ry state Wydo le Strange to have held it in capite, as a member of Little Ercall, and to have given it to Haughmond. The Taxation of 1291 gives 8s. 3d. as the Abbot's income from Nagenton, such being, I suppose, the service due on John de Na genton's feoffment. We have seen the purpose to which this rent was assigned by Bishop Langton in 131 5. s On October 15, 1474, John Abbot of Haghmon demises to Wil liam son of William Home, late of Childes-Ercal, the Grange of Naginton with three parcels of land within the demesne of Howie for 60 years, reserving a rent of 22s. and Suit of the Abbot's Court at Downton.4 The Valor of 1535-6 gives the Abbot's collective receipts from Cheswardine and Nagington as \u00a310. 18s. 4d. per an num. The Ministers' Accounts, six years later, give the ferm of Nagington Grange as \u00a31. 5s. 10c.., and the receipts from Cheswar dine as \u00a310. Of the Abbot of Haughmond's Feoffees here, I can only name Alan de Naginton, who occurs as early as 1230 and who was living in 1253; \u2014 William de Nagington, who occurs on local Juries in 1261 aud 1274; and John de Nagington, who similarly occurs in 1284, 1290, and 1306. Goldstone. The Feodaries of 1284-5 concur in making Gold stone a member of Ercall. I have no later proof of the fact. In after times it was considered as a member of Cheswardine, in which Parish it was at all times situated. The manorial change might easily arise from the tenure of Cheswardine and Ercall having been for a time nearly identical. I have nothing to say of the place ex cept that a Richard de Goldston occurs about 1240 and a Thomas de Goldston in 1306. CHILDS ERCALL CHURCH.

Having completed a survey of those eleven Manors of Recordine Hundred which were held at Domesday by Rainald Vicecomes, I proceed with nine Manors in the same district, which were held, under the Norman Earl, by William Pantulf and his Undertenants. I commence with Hinstock, because that Manor was usually held in demesne by the Pantulfs and their successors ; but I must post pone any general account of the Barony of Wem, till I come to Wem itself, which was in the Domesday Hundred of Odenet. Hinstock is described in Domesday as follows : \u2014 \"The same William (Pantulf) holds Stoche (under the Earl), and Sasfrid holds it of him. Algar held it (in Saxon times) . Here are two hides and a half, geldable. There is (arable) land, enough for five ox-teams. In demesne there is one Team, and two Neat herds and one Boor. Here is a league of wood. The Manor used to be worth 40s. yearly ; now it is worth 8s.\"3 After Domesday I find no mention of this Manor till about the year 1240, when Ralph le Botyler, holding it and Wem in de mesne, is said to hold \" one knight's fee in Hinestok and Wemme, of the Barony of Wemme;\"4 a curious mode of expressing the thing, since he was Baron of Wem at the time. The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 says that \" Ralph le Butiler holds the Manor of Hinstoke as included in the service due on the Barony of Wem. His Seneschal did suit for Hinstoke to County and Hundred, as he did for the Manor of Wem.

Among the items of in come a sum of 2s. is said to arise from a small weir (stagnum), and one merk from another weir and a Mill.1 Matilda Pantulf, Ralph de Butiller's Widow, remarried with Walter de Hopton. Hence the Bradford Tenure-Roll (about 1285) states the said Wal ter and Matilda to be holding Hynstoke, with Wem and its mem bers, in capite, and by a collective service of three knights'-fees. At the Assizes of 1292 Walter de Hopton was found to be exer cising Free- Warren in Hinstock. In January, 1306, William le Botiler, Grandson of the above-named Ralph and Matilda, wished to convey 60 acres of heath and the Advowson of the Church of Hinstock to Alcester Abbey. An inquest having been held on the subject, a Patent of King Edward I., dated November 22, 1306, allows the transfer.3 Sir William le Butler's Charter, which, as printed elsewhere,3 I need not repeat here, conveys the premises, with certain rights of common in Hinstock, to the Alcester Monks. The Deed makes mention of Beatrix, the Grantor's wife, and is at tested by Sir Fulk le Estrange, Lord Le Estrange; John le Estrange of Ercalouwhe (Ercall) ; John le Estrange of Cheselwar thyn (Cheswardine) ; Adam de Mekeleston ; and Richard Hord, the Grantor's Seneschal. An Inquest of May 12, 1327, incident ally values two-thirds of the Manors of Wem and Hinstock at _\u00a360 per annum, William le Botyler being then seized of the said two thirds. The King's Writ of Diem clausit, on the death of William le Botiler of Wem, issued on Sept. 14, 1334. Hinstock was one of the Manors of which he died seized. William, his son and heir, was found to have been 36 years of age and upwards, on Sept. 8, 1334.4 In June 1343, William le Botiler proposes to enfeoff two Trustees in the Manors of Hinstock and Tyrley, and in one third of Wem, and that the reversion of two-thirds of Wem, then held in dower by Ela widow of William le Botiler deceased, should devolve on the same Trustees. The Trustees, being seized, were to settle the premises on the said William, their Feoffor, and the heirs of his body ;\u2014 with remainder to his right heirs.

William, son and heir of the deceased, was now 30 years of age.1 With this William, who died on August 14, 1369, the elder male line of Botiler of Wem expired. Wem and Hinstock were en tailed on the heirs of his body, and so passed to his only daughter Elizabeth, who at the time of his death was aged 24 years and up wards.3 She conveyed the Barony of Wem to her husband, Robert de Ferrers. Their eldest son, Robert de Ferrers, died in 1410, his mother Elizabeth still living. He left two daughters and coheirs, Elizabeth born about 1393, and Mary, born about 1394. On the death of their Grandmother (June 19, 1411), Elizabeth was wife of John son of Ralph Baron Greystock, and Mary was wife of Ralph son of Ralph Nevill, Earl of Westmoreland.3 The Barony of Wem is now in abeyance between the descendants of these two ladies.4 HINSTOCK CHURCH. This was clearly nothing more than a Chapel, originally founded by the Lords of the Manor. To what Saxon Parish it originally belonged I cannot say. Childs Ercall has the claim of proximity. The Church is not mentioned in the Taxation of 1291, but Sir William le Butler's Deed, conveying the Advowson in 1306 to Al cester Abbey, calls it \" the parochial Church of the Vill of Hii% stock.\" In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth taxed this Parish* at 20s., placing it in the Deanery of Newport, but not quoting any valuation of the Church.5 The Valor of 1535-6 gives the Income of John Holwey, Rector of Hynstoke, as \u00a36 per annum, less 4s. for Procurations and Syno dals.6 The Prior of Alcester's cotemporary return of the income of his House, names no receipt from Hinstock, except 20s. rent of lands and tenements there.7 EARLY INCUMBENTS.

Shackleford, now Shackford or Shacksford, was I suppose a member of Hinstock Manor. The locality was notorious as the haunt of freebooters, and for the fees which the Barons of Wem exacted from travellers towards guarding some pass in the neigh bourhood. Particulars of this will transpire under Newport. In the reign of King John, Ivo Pantulf, a younger son of Hugh Pantulf, then Baron of Wem, seems to have had a feoffment in Shackford.

He further gives the Canons license to fish five times a year in his Vivary of Sakelford, viz. against Christmas and Easter Days, Pen tecost, the Assumption, and the Nativity of the Virgin.1 In June 1272 I find Adam de Chetwynd taking out a Writ of disseizin against Ralph le Botyler (then Baron of Wem) concerning a tenement in Sekelford.

That we should look for its modern representative to be near Hinstock, is suggested by Domesday, for, not only does Corselle follow next after Hin stock in the Record, but Sasfrid was Pantulf's Tenant in these two, and in no other Manors. There is a place now called Cross-Hill, about a mile south of Hinstock. Though it has long been un known as a distinct Manor, I look upon it as representing in situa tion and partially in name the Corselle of Domesday. Wdliam de Culleshasel, doubtless a tenant here, attests a Sand ford Deed about the year 1230. We have seen that, about the year 1237, the estate of Roger de Culshis, or de Cuneshasel, an Outlaw, was escheated : that Fulk fitz Warin, then Guardian of Maud Pantulf, heiress of Wem, ac counted to the Crown for the year and waste, which was the King's Lilleshall Chartulary, so. 64. 2 Domesday, so. 257, a, 2."], [479, "25 CORSELLE. prerogative in regard to the estate of any Outlaw, and that then Fulk fitz Warin enfeoffed Ralph de Hodnet in the premises.1 I take Ralph de Hodnet to be identical with Ralph le Gras, whom a Feodary of 1240 inserts as holding half a knight's fee in Colsnek, of the Barony of Wem.3 On November 2, 1242, we have Adam (it should be Ralph) le Butiller and Matilda (Pantulf) his wife suing Ralph de Hodnet for half a knight's fee in Cummeshal, as the es cheat of Matilda.3 In Trinity Term 1243 and Easter Term 1244, the Rolls supply other notices of this suit as one for two-thirds of half a knight's fee in Cunseshasel, in which Fulk fitz Warin, while Custos of Maud Pautulf's estates, had unjustly enfeoffed Ralph de Hodnet. The latest notice of the active suit leaves Ralph de Hod net calling Fulk fitz Warin to warranty. Moreover a Fine of November 3, 1244, shows the result. Thereby Ralph de Hodnet, Tenant of two-thirds of a whole knight's fee in Cuneshasel, quit claims the same to Ralph de Butiler and Matilda his wife and the heirs of Matilda ; but the Plaintiffs pay 40 merks for the surrender. About 1260-70 I find repeated mention of one Roger de Coles hasel. It will presently appear that his heir, Lucia, was also heir of one Henry de Coleshasel, and married Richard de Okeleye. Id 1271 Roger Waldyn had a Writ of novel disseizin against Ralph le Botyler and others concerning a tenement in Sambrok. The cause was tried at the Assizes of 1272, when William de Tyt tenelegh and Ralph le Botyler, being Defendants, disproved the alleged disseizin, on the ground that Roger Waldyng had never been seized of the 40 acres which he now sought. I have introduced this matter here, because I think that William de Titley was already acquiring an interest at Cross- Hill, and that the question was one of boundary between Cross- HU1 and Roger Waldyng's estate at Sambrook. About 1285 the Bradford Tenure-Roll gives the Vill of Culsis as a distinct member of the Barony of Wem, and as held by William Titteley for half a knight's fee. A Fine of June 20, 1289, exhibits William de Tytneleye as buy ing up an Undertenant's interest in a considerable estate here. The parties to the Fine are the said William (Plaintiff), and Richard son of Stephen de Okeleye and Lucia his wife (Deforciants) . The latter acknowledge a gift to the Plaintiff, of one messuage, one mill, and two carucates of land in Coleshasel, whereof was plea 1 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 77. 2 Testa de Nevill, p. 45-6.

Moreover, for themselves and for the heirs of Lucia, they concede that a messuage and two virgates which Margery widow of Roger de Coleshasel now held in dower, and which were of Lucia's inheritance, should remain to the Plaintiff and his heirs. Also they concede that a messuage and 1^ virgates which Petro nilla, widow of Henry de Coleshasel, held in dower, of Lucia's in heritance, should remain to the Plaintiff, who is to hold the whole by a clove-rent payable to the Deforciants and by rendering all ser vices due to the Lord of the Fee. For this the Plaintiff gives a sore sparrow-hawk ,- whilst -the two widows, Margery and Petro nilla, appear in Court and do fealty to William de Tytneleye. Of William de Titneleye I shall have more to say under Waters Upton. A Tenure Roll of Bradford Hundred, drawn up in Febru ary 1348, has Colsesul as half a knight's-fee, held of the Barony of Wem.1 Nicholas Abbot of Buildwas acquired for his House a rent of 12s. in Culce. This was by Fine, levied at Shrewsbury, in January 1256. The Grantor, Thomas de Sambrok, and his wife Alice, and their heirs were promised participation in the prayers and interces sions of the Buildwas Monks for ever.3 The Tenant who was to pay the said rent, viz. Thomas son of John de Culce, was present when the Fine was levied, and was agreeable thereto. eptmt on tlje OTealtmtoors- Domesday describes this Manor among those held by William Pantulf under the Norman Earl. \" The same William holds Etone, and Warin holds it of him.

Be sides Eyton he held Bratton and Horton under the same Baron. The next known Lord of these three Manors was Robert de Eyton, living in the reign of Henry II. The probability that Robert de Eyton was Warin's direct descendant and heir is not the mere ave rage probability that the Tenant of three distinct Manors a century after Domesday was the lineal representative of the Tenant of those same Manors at Domesday. Pantulf's Barony was exempt from all probability of being disturbed as to its constituents by that great Shropshire catastrophe, the fall of Eari Robert de Belesme. We know in short that it was then or afterwards enlarged rather than diminished, and we may fairly presume that this was in reward of the loyalty of its Chief, and his services at the siege of Bridg north. Again, it is probable that Warin was himself a Cadet of the House of Pantulf, for the Descendants of Robert de Eyton, his presumed heir, have uniformly quartered the Arms of Pantulf. It has been suggested that this quartering of the Arms of a Suzerain might have been merely in token of feudal dependence. The alternate theory seems to be that, when a Vassal is found bearing the Arms of his Suzerain, as a quarter, and without any difference, he was his Suzerain's relation by blood as well as tenure. I should now observe that the Lords of Eyton are found to have obtained feoffment from the Barons of Wem in four Manors, in which Domesday does not state that Warin or any other Tenant had as yet acquired investiture. That this change was soon after Domesday is clear, for the whole Fief held by De Eyton under Pan tulf was of old Feoffment. The four Manors in question were But tery, Half-Lawley, and Sutton, all in Shropshire, and Cresswell, in Staffordshire. It is with respect to Buttery, and Robert de Ey ton's disposal thereof in the reign of Henry IL, that the history of this family re commences, nearly a century after Domesday. Robert de Eyton gave Buttery to Shrewsbury Abbey, with the consent of Ivo Pan tulf his Suzerain. As usual in such early grants, the confirming Deed of the Suzerain is the only one preserved, perhaps the only one executed at the time. Ivo Pantulf addressing his sons, acquaints them that \" he has conceded in almoign to the Monks of Shrews bury a certain estate (unam terram) which is called Buttereia, which Robert de Eiton had given to the said Monks.

Meverel, Roger de Bethesloua, John de Eppeleia, Helias de Jai, Robert Christian, fee.\"1 The above Deed probably passed between 1170 and 1175, and so was coeval with the close of Robert de Eyton' s life. Peter de Eyton, his successor and I presume his son, is known chiefly by his attestations of the earlier Charters of Wombridge Priory. The Benefactions of Madoc ap Gervase, Lord of Sutton, of Walter de Dunstanvill, Lord of Idsall, of John de Cambrai Lord of Lee-Gomery and of Alan de Hadley Lord of Hadley, range be tween the years 1180 and 1.194, and they are nearly all attested by Peter de Eyton.3 In 1191, as I infer from the names of the Justiciars who tried it, a suit about land in Cheswell was decided by verdict of twelve Re cognizors. Peter de Eiton was one of them, and the matter hav ing been re-opened in June 1200, he attended at Westminster with six other Recognizors (survivors, I presume, of the twelve), to cer tify what had taken place in 119L3 In 1207 a number of amercements (probably inflicted at a recent Forest-Assize) are entered on the Shropshire Pipe-Roll. One of half a merk is charged on Peter de Eaton. The Pipe-Roll of 1212 contains a Fine of 100s. which Peter de Hetton had prof fered and paid for having the land of his Father (pro habendd terra patris sui) . It is not known that the Eytons were Tenants in-capite, nor was the Barony of Wem likely at this period to have been in custody of the Crown. Still I cannot help thinking that this Fine indicates the succession of an Eyton of Eyton to his Fa ther. If so, both Father and Son were named Peter, and what I have further to say about a Peter de Eyton must belong to \u2014 Peter de Eyton II. About the year 1220, as I think, Peter de Eyton, calling himself \" son of Peter de Eyton, made a concession to Lilleshall Abbey. His Charter is entitled in the Chartulary of that House as Carta Petri de Eyton de stagno de Lubersty el molen dino ibidem firmando. He concedes for the souls'-health of him self, his ancestors and successors, and in pure alms, a stank for the Abbot's Vivary on the rivulet called Holebroch in the Moor of Hoi'dbur', and allows that the Canons may establish such stank on his land, and that the water may thus be made to back-pound on his land.4 1 Salop Chartulary, No. 33, 3 Placita, Trim Tm., 2 John, m. 20. 4 Lilleshall Chartulary, so. 70. 2 Supra, Vol. II. pp. 112, 279, 280 ; Vol. VII. pp. 341, 355."], [483, "29 EYTON ON THE WEALDMOORS. A similar and, I presume, cotemporary concession by the Te nants-in-fee of the adjoining Manor of Preston was sanctioned by the Deed of their Suzerain, viz. Baldwin de Hodnet, who died in December 1224. This gives the probable date of the transaction. Some local peculiarities are worth observation. The spot where the Abbot of Lilleshall intended to establish a Vivary, or Mill, or both, is still known as Lubstree Park, The Brook, then called Holebrook, but now Humber-Brook, here divided the Abbot's Grange of Honington on the East, from Peter de Eyton's Manor of Horton and Baldwin de Hodnet's Manor of Preston on the West. Such a brook could not be dammed up or impounded without the consent of the landholders on the opposite bank. Hence the above concessions to Lilleshall. In Trinity Term 1222 and again in Easter Term 1226, Peter de Eyton and Thomas de Constantine were the only two Recognizors who attended at Westminster, in a great cause between Giles de Erdington and Elena Princess of Wales, concerning the Manor of Wellington. Between the years 1216 and 1224 we have seen Peter de Eyton attesting a Deed of Alan, Abbot of Lilleshall.1 This conjunction of names may serve to date an agreement which resulted after some dispute between the said Abbot Alan and Peter de Eyton relative to the right of common in their respective woods. The Canons and their men were now to have the same entire common-right in Peter's Wood as they had enjoyed of old. Peter was to have simi lar right in the Canon's wood, except in the Park called Gubald's Haye and in other places enclosed with ditch or fence. Moreover Peter's men of Buterey were to have housebote and haybote in the Canons' moor of The Wildemoor, without question or view of the Canons' Foresters, but they were to give or sell nothing of the said easements, nor indeed to use them themselves, except when Peter's own land could not fully supply their needs. And the said men of Buterey were to make oath to keep faith with the Church of Lilles hall both with respect to that moor and other places. Each Party sealed a counterpart of this agreement and the Writings were ex- changed.3 The above agreement affords some presumption that Peter de Eyton had not as yet recognized his Ancestor's grant of Buttery to Shrewsbury Abbey. We happen however to know that he did so subsequently. The years 1225 and 1227 are the certain limits of a 1 Supra, Vol. II. p. 103.

Deed whereby \" Peter de Eyton gives to the said Abbey the whole land of Butherey and acquits it of all services to himself.\" This purports to have been done for a nominal sum of 2s. paid by the Monks, and the Deed was attested by Sir John le Strange, William Pantulf, Ralph de Picheford, John Boneth then Sheriff of Salope sire, William Thaleboth, Hugh fitz Robert, Hugh de Hedlega, John de Chetewind, Roger Sprenghose, William Chaplain of Wroccestre, Thomas de Eston, Wido de Gleseg (Glazeley), Ralph Marescall (of Boreton), and Hugh de Kynsedeleg.1 The Pipe- Roll of 1231 has Peter de Eytun as amerced 20s. for not producing one, for whom he was Surety, at a recent Forest- Assize. An agreement between the Abbot of Shrewsbury and William de Ercalwe bears date May 13, 1234, and is attested by Peter de Eyton as second, and by William de Eyton as fifth witness. Peter and William were, perhaps, father and son, though, as we shall see, Peter had a brother named William. The latest notice which I have of Peter de Eython as he is called, bears date October 13, 1237, when with twelve other Recognizors of knightly degree, he attended a great Trial concerning Shawbury, taken before the King himself at Worcester. At his death, which must have taken place within three years after this, Peter de Eyton left his wife Alice sur viving. On February 3, 1249, the said Alice quitclaimed to Adam Abbot of Shrewsbury all her right in Botereye, in the way of dower, the Abbot undertaking to pay her an annuity of half a merk. Wit nesses, Richard de Preston and Robert de Rodinton.3 In or about January 1250, Geoffrey de Langley set an arrentation of 9c/. on an acre at Eyton, taken from the Forest by \" Alice, Relict of Peter de Eyton.\" William de Eyton, the brother of Peter, already men tioned, was seated at Eaton upon Tern. He occurs as a Juror or a Surety in June 1220 and August 1226, his name being written Eton or Ethon ; but in a grant which about 1223 he made of a meadow at Eaton, he calls himself \" William son of Peter de Eton,\" son that is, as I think, of Peter de Eyton (I.). I shall recur to him and his successors at Eaton, when I come to that place. Peter de Eyton (II.) was succeeded at Eyton by his son and heir, \u2014 William de Eyton, whom the Feodaries of 1240 enter as hold ing one fee -in Eyton, and one fee in Kereswall (Cresswell),3 of the de Cressewelle as the immediate Tenant of Cressewelle ; but he was in fact William de Eyton's Tenant there. 1 * 2 Salop Chartulary, Nos. 280, 402. 3 Testa de Nevill, pp. 45, 48, 49, 50, 51. A sixth entry (p. 47 ibidem) has Thomas"], [485, "EYTON ON THE WEALDMOORS. 31 Barony of Wem. Though so great a Feoffee, it does not appear that this William ever obtained the honour of knighthood. We have had double proof that in November 1240 he had married an heiress or coheiress, Matilda by name.1 Her interest at Leonards- Lee seems to have been in part sold, while that at Rochull (near Wall-Town) was established against certain disputants. It is probable that William de Eyton was for a time cotemporary with his Uncle of the same name, and it is certain that a third William de Eyton was resident near the Wrekin about this period. I can hardly distinguish the Lord of Eyton and these cotempora ries, by their position in certain testing-clauses and jury-lists. Between the years 1242 and 1248 William de Etton was the third of twelve Recognizors who attended the Sheriff, Forester, and Verderers of Shropshire to decide what were the Abbot of Lilies hall's rights in a question of forest-law. In 1248 William de Etun was fourth juror on a Withyford Inquest. Again William de Eton was Foreman of the Jury which about February 1249 attended at Shrewsbury to make Inquest as to the estate of Hugh Fitz Robert, late Forester of Shropshire. This William I take to have been surely the individual now under notice. As William de Ethon he again sat Foreman of a Jury which on January 30, 1251, decided a dispute between the Abbeys of Buildwas and Lilleshall. In 1255 he was deceased, his widow Matilda surviving him, but his son and heir, Peter, being an infant, probably under ten years of age. Hence the Bradford Hundred- Roll of 1255 says as follows. \u2014 \"Peter de Eiton is Lord of Eiton and is in ward to Peter Peverel by gift of Ralph le Butiler (then Baron of Wem). And he (Peter de Eiton) holds the said Manor by service of one knight at Wemme, in time of war, for 40 days, at his own charges. And the Manor used to do suit to County and Hundred, but it has been withdrawn these ten years ; and the said suit is worth 2s. yearly.\"3 Matilda, widow of William de Eyton, remarried to Walter de Pedwardine and took with her in dower one-third of two parts of the estate of Eyton. The remaining part had never come to Wil liam de Eyton' s hands, for it was held at the time of his death by his mother Alice, who survived him. Alice however died before 1256, and at the Assizes of January in that year a curious point in the Law of Dower had its solution. Walter de Pedwardine and Matilda his wife, having already one-third of two-thirds of two carucates in Eyton in Wydemore as Matilda's dower, sued Peter 1 Vol. II. p. 315 ; Vol. IV. p. 275. | 2 Rot. Hundred. II. 58."], [486, "32 EYTON ON THE WEALDMOORS. Peverel and Ralph de Kent for a third of that remaining third which had now lapsed to the general estate by death of Alice. The Plaintiffs asserted that William de Eyton had given dower to Ma tilda out of this remaining third. This the Defendants denied, say ing that William had never been seized of the said third except in tenancy and during the period between his father Peter's death and the allotment of the said third as his mother's dower. The facts were not in dispute. They were, that Peter de Eyton died seized of the whole estate, that William his son and heir instantly after wards gave one third to his mother Alice in dower, and had never been otherwise in seizin of such third; \u2014 obviously because his mother survived him. The question was one of law, viz. whether Walter de Pedwardine and Matilda could demand dower out of dower, i.e. take thirds in such part of William de Eyton's estate as had reverted since his death ? The Court decided in the negative, dismissed Peverel and Kent sine die, and pronounced the Plaintiffs in misericordid for a false claim.1 Walter de Pedwardine, Lord of Ingwardine in 1255 and 1284, has already been noticed.3 His distinctive career rather belongs to the localities now under notice, where he was resident for years. As early as 1253 he was foreman of a Jury which made Inquest as to estates in Uppington and Newport. He took the Royalist side during the civil wars of 1264-5, and it was probably for some mea sures against a political opponent that he was impleaded in 1266 and 1268 as before noticed.3 We must'remember however that the scene of his alleged trespass wa3 Rochull, a place where very proba bly he had an interest in right of his wife. A Patent of June 24, 1267, makes him Fermor for life of the King's Hundred of Brad ford. This was in reward of his faithful services ; but the Rent of 8 merks which was retained by the Crown is known to have been a full and fair value of the office. We have seen Sir Walter de Ped wardine attesting a Charter of Walter de Dunstanville about 1269 and of Petronilla his daughter about 1274.4 He died apparently in 1297, but without any recorded interest remaining in North Shropshire. His tenure under the Bromptons of Brompton Brian will have notice elsewhere. He was succeeded by a son Roger, of full age at his decease and perhaps his son by Matilda de Eyton. Meantime \u2014 Peter de Eyton (III.) had arrived at man's estate. The first 1 Assizes, 40 Hen.

At the Assizes of September 1272 Peter de Eyton was third Juror for Bradford Hundred. His position on a Jury of March 1276 is not among the knights who composed it, but in an Inquest of December 2, 1277, he takes precedence of several whom I know to have been knights at the time. In July 1278 he appears as one of the Verderers of the Shropshire Forests, and in January 1283 he is expressly styled a knight on a Newport Inquest. From this period till his death his occurrences as a Verderer, a Juror, or a Witness, are very frequent. The Feodaries of 1284-5, when col lated, show that Peter de Eyton was then holding two knights'-fees under Walter de Hopton and his wife Matilda (Baroness of Wem). The Manors named as constituting this Fief are Eyton, Brochetone (Bratton), Sutton, and half Lawley, in Shropshire, and Cresswell in Staffordshire. The latter was held under him by Henry de Cress well. At the Assizes of 1292 he was one of the two Elisors, sworn to elect the Jury for Bradford Hundred. In the same year he was one of the Knights who tried several of those Pleas of Quo Waranto to which I am so often referring. He was returned for Salop as a knight of the Shire to the Parliament held at York on May 25, 1298, and again to the Parliament held at Lincoln in January 1301. The latter he attended, and obtained his Writ of expenses for so doing. His Manucaptors were Roger le Wodeward of Eyton, and Richard his Brother.1 Meanwhile, on June 5, 1300, as one of the Verderers of Shropshire, he attended the great Perambulation then made, and afterwards ratified by Edward I. Peter de Eyton (III.) had settled his estate, or at least the Manor of Eyton, by a Fine levied at Westminster on January 27, 1292. He first gives it to his son Peter (the Plaintiff), who returns it to his father, to hold for fife, under the Lords of the Fee, with remain der to Peter junior and the heirs of his body, or in default of such heirs to Margery, sister of Peter junior and the heirs of her body, with remainder to the right heirs of Peter senior quit of any other heirs of Margery. Peter de Eyton (IV.), who, in October 1302, March 1303, January 1305, and March and May 1308, occurs as a prominent witness of Wombridge Charters, is in no instance styled a knight. 1 Parliamentary Writs, IV. 580. viii. 5"], [488, "34 EYTON ON THE WEALDMOORS. He was, I doubt not, the above-named son of Peter (III.), now in possession of his estate. On May 21, 1311, he is styled \" Lord of Eyton,\" and either under that style or as merely Peter de Eyton, he is a frequent witness of Wombridge Charters, the latest of which bears date January 20, 1324. A charter which I have ventured to date in 1320 speaks of him as Peter son of Sir Peter de Eyton and as having granted to the Canons of Wombridge a right of road through his land of Lega.1 This estate at Leonards Lee, whatever its extent, probably came to him in right of his grandmother, Matilda. On April 28, 1325, he was appointed a Commissioner for the purpose of raising Hobelers and Archers in Shropshire and Staffordshire, in place of Alan de Cherleton.3 Three Writs of the same year, the latest dated Sept. 20, instruct him concerning the marching and inspection of these levies ; \u2014 but nothing further do I learn certainly of him.3 John de Eyton, presumed to have been son and heir of Peter de Eyton (IV.), occurs as John de Eyton on August 13, 1328, and as John, Lord of Eyton, on Sept. 21, 1331, and as John de Eyton on Jan. 6, 1333 ; \u2014 and from thence till July 25, 1344, when he is styled Dominus Johannes de Eyton super le Wildmore, but it is evi dent from the context of this Deed4 that he was not a knight, and I take it that neither he nor his father nor yet his son ever attained that dignity. On May 7, 1339, a Fine was levied whereby Richard de Tatenhall and Margery his wife (Deforciants) quitclaim for them selves, and the heirs of Margery, to John de Eyton (Plaintiff) 100s. rent in Eyton super le Wyldmore. For this, John de Eyton paid 60 merks. Peter de Eyton (V.), presumed son and heir of John, occurs as a witness on March 25 and May 3, 1354.5 On April 2, 1366, he presented to Eyton Church, and on May 21, 1377, he occurs 1 Supra, Vol. II. p. 317. ports to have been dated at Stafford in 8 Edw. III. (1334-5). Henry de Cresswell was certainly living in 1316, and so far Dugdale's date is plausible ; but I strong ly suspect some error in the said date when I refer it to the known era of Peter de Eyton (IV.). The grant, whatever its date, surely implies the continued mesne lordship of Peter de Eyton (IV.) or (V.) at Cresswell. 2 Parliamentary Writs, IV. 805. 3 Dugdale (MS. 39. so. 82) gives an ab stract of a Deed, whereby \" Peter de Ey ton de Wyldemor gives to Sir Nicholas Beek, Chevalier, the wardship and mar riage of Margaret, daughter and heir of John de Leye, deceased, till the full age of the said Margaret, gives (namely) the Manor of Cressewall and the reversion of such land as Dame Jone, widow of Sir Henry de Cressewall, held in Cressewall in the name of Dower.\" This Deed pur- 4 Wombridge Chartulary, Tit.

With him I must conclude an account which has already extended later than my usual limits. EYTON CHURCH. This Church must have been originally a Chapel, founded indeed by the Lords of the Manor and always bestowed at their presenta tion, but founded nevertheless within the limits of some ancient and adjacent Parish, probably that of Wellington. The Church is dedicated to St. Catherine, and Tradition says that one Catherine de Eyton vowed its foundation in the event of the safe return of her husband, then absent on a Crusade. The motto of the Lords of Eyton \u2014 Je m'y oblige, or, / bind myself, is further said to have reference to this vow and its pious accomplishment. This Church is not mentioned in the Taxation of 1291, and the earliest dated Record which indicates its existence is the admission of a Rector thereto in 1336. Again Eyton is not recognized as a distinct Parish in the Inquisi tion of 1341 ; but in the Valor of 1534-5, Eyton super Wyldmor is entered as a Rectory, in the Deanery of Newport ; \u2014 whose Rector, Roger Gerves, derived a clear income of \u00a32. 4s. 8d. from this pre ferment.3 EARLY INCUMBENTS.

Robert de Eyton's transfer of the Manor to Shrewsbury Abbey has also been recorded. The remaining history of the place should be as an estate of the said Abbey. However neither the Taxation of 1291 nor the Valor of 1535-6 take any notice of Buttery as thus held. The only Docu ment which does notice it is a Rent- Roll of Shrewsbury Abbey, drawn up at the close of the fifteenth century.

It became thus associated with Eyton, by reason of the tenure of the two being identical, and they were usually reputed to be one Manor. It is a township in Wrockwardine Parish, and is wholly in the possession of the present Representative of the Eytons. I think it probable from the following Deed that Sibil wife of Sir Hugh and mother of Sir Philip Burnell was an Eyton, and had her marriage portion in Bratton. On February 16, 1299, Sibil, late wife of Hughe Burnel, gives to Master William Burnel, her son, all her tenement in Brocton pres de Welinton, to hold for his life ; \u2014 with remainder to Walter Beisin and Alice his wife and to William de Ercalwe and Petronilla3 his wife and the heirs of said William and Petronilla, \u2014 rendering all capital services.

The Hundred-Roll of 1255 says that \" Radulf de Stanton holds two virgates in Laueleg of the Fee of Wem.\" Here the mesne-lord (Peter de Eyton) is not mentioned. About 1284-5 two Feodaries of Bradford Hundred concur in stating that \" Radulf de Stanton held half the rill of Laueleye under Peter de Eyton, who held under the Lord of Wem, who held in capite.\" Walter de Stanton (son and heir of Ralph as I suppose) occurs on a Wellington Jury in 1284. Subsequently he enfeoffed Robert Corbet of Morton and his wife Matilda in certain tene ments in Laueleye which were held under Peter de Eyton by a rent of 5s. Robert Corbet and his wife were conjointly seized of this tenement (which was in fact the moiety of Lawley now under notice) in 1300, when the said Robert Corbet died.3 For proof that the Eytons retained their mesne interest in Lawley nearly four centuries later, I refer to a note.3 Norton.

The concessions which the latter made to Lilleshull Abbey in respect to Lubstree Vivary about 1220 show him, I think, to have been Lord of Horton.1 It is also certain that an interest in Horton, though not the sole interest, has remained with Peter de Eyton's descend ants to this very day.3 With respect however to the bulk of Horton, the history of the Manor is much more associated with that of Preston on the Weald moors than with that of Eyton. In short the Horton which we usually hear of in the thirteenth century was held of the Fee of Hodnet by Tenants, some at least of whom held in Preston, of the same Fee. This tenure was quite independent of any mesne interest of the Lords of Eyton, who I conclude must have lost something in Horton, though something they retained. Without vain speculation on this anomaly I proceed to state what I find about the Tenants of Horton. \u2014 Roger de Preston, younger brother of that Baldwin de Hodnet, who died in 1224, gave half a virgate in Horton to Lilleshall Abbey, and Odo de Hodnet, son and heir of Baldwin, confirmed the grant.3 Sabina de Horton, daughter of Pagan de Preston, was I know a Coparcener in Preston and wife first of William and then of Roger de Preston. She, in one of her widowhoods, gave with her body to Lilleshull Abbey, a messuage, a croft and a meadow in Horton. Witnesses, Adam de Preston, Ralph de Preston, William Urse of Mokeleston, William de Tyrne, John de Horton, Robert fitz Denys, Roger de Monte, and Roger le Harpur.4 It was in respect, I pre sume, of the above grants, that an early Rent- Roll of Lilleshull Abbey gives 20c.. receivable annually de terra de Horton. William fitz Eustace, a Juror in a neighbouring Inquest of 1249, was I know of Horton. In 1250 Geoffrey de Langley assessed Matilda, relict of Eustace de Horton, and Helewise, relict of Reginald de Horton, for assarted lands at Hadley. In 1255 the Bradford Jurors presented Odo de Hodnet as re ceiving 4c.. per annum from John de Horton, for advowry?

Witnesses, Sir Thomas Lyart, Perpetual Vicar of Welinton and the Lord Rector of the Chapel of Preston, Peter de Eyton, Adam de Preston, Pagan de Preston, Richard de Horton, John de Horton, and Robert Silion.1 In the Bradford Tenure-Roll (about 1286) Preston, Horton and half the vill of Lawley are put down as members of Hodnet, and as held under William de Hodnet as Mesne-Lord. I do not doubt the general accuracy of the statement, though how to account for it in the cases of Horton and Lawley I know not. William de Horton who occurs on a local jury in 1281, will hereafter appear as a Coparcener of Preston in 1292. Parochially, Horton is now reputed to be a member of Welling ton ; but a Terrier of Eyton, drawn up in 1625, shows that Horton had then a parochial status just as divided as its previous manorial condition. Sir Philip Eyton paid two-thirds of his tithes to Eyton and one-third to Wellington (I presume as the Mother \"Church of Eyton). But twelve cottagers in Horton's Wood paid part of their tithes to Eyton and part to Wellington. Also the people of Hor ton's Wood received the Communion at Eyton and paid their duties there, but christened and buried at Wellington. The inference from all this is that when Eyton Church was founded by the Lords of the Manor, they endowed it, as far as they could, with tithes of their estates at Horton and Eyton, making some composition with the Mother Church of Wellington. In 1625 the ratio of the case was forgotten, and litigation was impending as to the then current practice. Not wishing to insist on any view of the matter as a question of ecclesiastical law, long since settled, I only quote the data of the dispute as reminiscences of the partial connection which has existed between Horton and Eyton ever since Domesday.

The first of these is Roger de Bethesloua, whom we have seen, about 1170-5, attesting Ivo Pantulf's confirmation of Buttery to Shrews bury Abbey.2 Next comes Richard de Beszelawe, whose name ap pears on the Pipe- Roll of 1176 as owing an amercement of one merk, because he had failed to produce Robert de Wudecote for Trial. Roger de Besselawe occurs as a Witness about 1220.3 From about 1240 to 1255 I find occasional mention of Robert de Besse lawe as a Juror or a Witness. In the latter year, though the Bradford Hundred-Roll omits all mention of Beslow, the Pimhill Hundred- Roll notices this Robert as holding part of Slepe under the then Baron of Wem.* Robert de Beslow I think was a Juror for Bradford Hundred at the Assizes of January 1256, but the name is written Esselawe. From about 1256 to 1283 I find Hugh de Beslow acting as a Juror on four different Inquests, and attest ing several Charters of the same period. About 1285 the Bradford Tenure- Roll says distinctly that \" Beslow is held as a member of Wem, under Walter and Matilda de Hopton, by Hugh de Beslow, and for half a knight's-fee.\" This, or another, Hugh occurs on a local Jury in December 1298, and again in 1315, but after him I find no mention of the family or Manor for a considerable period. Eventually an heir female of the Beslows took the estate into the family of Poynor. Beslow Chapel.

So it was with Dawley ; but a younger branch of the Pantulfs held Dawley under the elder, and, together with Daw ley, Tibberton, and Great Norton, the last of which has been al ready treated of.3 The first of this younger line of Pantulfs, of whom I have any notice, was Ralph Pantulf, probably more distantly re lated to Ivo Pantulf, the cotemporary Baron of Wem, than as a son or a brother. We have seen this Ralph, about 1170-5, attest ing Ivo's confirmation of Buttery to Shrewsbury Abbey.3 The Pipe-Roll of 1180 registers Ralph Pantulf as owing a fine of half a merk for license to construct a mill and stank in his own arable field. This was obviously because the premises were within juris diction of the Forest. We have seen Ralph Pantulf attesting a Deed of Walter de Dun stanvill, about 1188,4 and about four years later, we observe that in a similar attestation by Ralph Pantulf, his name is followed by that of William his son.5 Before 1199 the said William had apparently succeeded to his Father, for the Pipe Roll of that year exhibits William Pantulf as fining one merk for license to assart 3 acres of Riflet. This William is followed in the testing clauses of certain grants to Wombridge Priory by his brother Philip. In October 1203 William Pantulf was deceased, for at the Assizes then held, \" Felicia his widow sued Alan Pantulf for her reasonable dower,\" viz. for a third part of William's whole tenement in Dalilca, and in Tibricton and in a third place, unintelligibly written, but which I take to mean Norton. Alan Pantulf assented to the claim, and the Sheriff was ordered to apportion the said thirds.6 I cannot determine whether Alan Pantulf was the son or the brother of William, but on March 18, 1218, he in turn was dead, leaving an heir in minority.

It is to these Ladies that reference is made in the Feodary of 1240, where it is said that \" the heirs of Adam Panton hold one fee in Dalileg and Tibertton of the Barony of Wemme.\"3 The four coheiresses of Pantulf of Dawley and Tibberton were in 1255 represented by William de Cavereswelle, Richard le Irishe, Michael de Morton, and John de Chavernes. \" These four held the vill of Dalileg by service of one Montar at Wem, in time of war, to wit, for 40 days at their own cost. The Seneschal of Wem did suit to County and Hundred for the said Vill.\"3 In describing the Coparceners of Tibberton the same Record substitutes Christiana de Dalileg for John de Chavernes.4 The truth is that John and Christiana were man and wife. William de Cavers wall, one of above Coparceners in Dawley, was representative of a family long seated at Caverswall in Stafford shire. He occurs as a Coparcener in Dawley in a Fine of the year 1256, which I shall quote in its place. All that I shall further say of him here is, that between the years 1256 and 1260 he sold his share of Dawley and Tibberton to Michael de Morton, reserving however a rent to himself as Mesne-Lord. His Deed, relating to this transaction, purports to be a grant by William de Kaverswall to Michael de Morton of all the land which he (William) had and held in Dalile and Tubrinton with all homages, suits, &c., of Tenants :\u2014 to hold in fee, at a rent of \u00a33. 13s. 4c. . payable at Morton to the Grantor, and by performing all suits and other ser vices (to the Seigneural Lords).

This Michael was also a Staffordshire man. He held a share of the Manor of Morton, in that county, under Fitz Alan. I shall often have to speak of his acquisitions in Shropshire. In 1285 the Bradford Tenure-Roll makes Dawley and Tibberton to be members of Walter and Matilda de Hopton's Barony. Michael de Moreton (he was son of the first Michael) and Reginald de Charneus are said to hold the two Manors by ser vice of half a knight's-fee, but the Coparcenery of Irish was, as we shall see, still existent. A Patent dated at York on Nov. 17, 1316, allows William de Morton, Clerk, to surround his mansion of Da lileye with a wall of stone and lime and to embattle the same. Master John de Cherlton is said to be the nuncians of this Writ. It shows us the origin of Dawley Castle. I now return to \u2014 John de Chavernes, who, with his wife Christiana de Dawley, was one of the Coparceners of 1255-6.1 He too was of a Stafford shire family, long seated at Charnes, a Manor which they held under the See of Lichfield. Reginald de Charnes occurs as a Juror for Bradford Hundred in 1272, on a Wem Jury in 1281, and as a Coparcener in Dawley in 1285, and in June 1300, as one of the Jurors who made Perambulation of the Shropshire Forests.3 This Reginald de Charnes was, it seems, a Tenant of some wood land at Parva Legh, a member of Idsall.3 An Inquest of Sept. 24, 1310, found it to be non-injurious to the Crown that the said Re ginald should bestow ten acres of the said woodland on Buildwas Abbey. The Tenants over Reginald were Peter de Eyton and Hugh de Say of Morton, but to them he owed no service. They again held under Thomas Tochet (Lord of Leegomery), who held in capite, so that it would seem a part of Parva Legh was a mem ber of Leegomery. Reginald's proposed grant was worth 2s. per annum, and if it should take effect he would still have one-fourth of the Vills of Dalileye and Tibriton, which he held under William le Botiler, Baron of Wem, by services of rendering 6 arrows, barbed and feathered with peacock's plumes, and of appearing twice yearly at his Suzerain's Great Courts at Hinstock. He would also retain estates at Prees and at Charnes, held under the Bishop of Chester.* 1 It is possible that one Robert de Chavernes preceded John as a Coparcener in Dawley.

This was originally a Chapel, subject to the great Saxon Church of St. Andrew at Idsall. William Priest of Daldea, who has been noticed as occurring about 1186-7,3 was probably the officiating Priest of this Chapel, whose foundation we thus fix as early as the twelfth century. We have seen that Walter de Dunstanvdl (II.) recovered the Advowson of Idsall from Shrewsbury Abbey, in 1219.8 In 1256 Walter de Dunstanvill (III.), as Patron of the Mother Church, was equally successful in recovering the Advowson of Daw ley from the joint lords of the Manor, who fined 20s. with the justices-in-eyre for license to accord. Their Agreement is pre served. \u2014 \" Michael de Morthon, Richard le Ireys, John de Chaver nes and his wife Christiana and William de Cavereswell, defendants of the Advowson of the Chapel of Dalileye-Paunton, recognized Walter de Dunstanvill's right thereto as an appurtenance of the Mother Church of Ideshall, which was of his patronage. For this quitclaim Dunstanvill paid 18 merks.\" Dawley is never mentioned as a distinct or independent Church in the early Diocesan Registers or in Ecclesiastical Surveys. The Advowson went with that of Idsall to Battlefield College, which ob tained an appropriation of both.

I suppose that Richard de Curcell, who appears to have lived in the time of Earl Hugh (1093-8), \u2022** was Roger de Curcell's successor. Whether the line ended in a sole heiress who took the estates to Pantulf of Wem, or whether the Fief of De Curcell was one of those which were forfeited by the rebellion of 1102, I cannot say. William Pantulf's loyalty on the latter occasion makes it very supposable that his Barony was augmented at the expense of some of Belesme's adherents. Roger de Curcelle held two Manors in Recordine Hundred under Earl Roger. One of these, Tibberton, is thus described in Domes day. \u2014 \" The same Roger (de Curcelle) holds Tetbristone.

He belonged to a family of which my notices are very scat tered. In the time of Hugh Earl of Shrewsbury (1093-8) we hear of one Ralph de Conedour. He attests that Earl's undoubted Charter to Salop Abbey;3 and he was surviving in May 1121, and then at tested Henry I.'s general confirmation to the same House.4 Gilbert de Conedour, with whom we are now concerned, was cotemporary with Ralph, that is, he was living in the time of Earl 1 Supra, Vol. VI. p. 170. 2 Domesday, so. 256, a, 2. 3 Salop Chartulary, No. 4. 4 Ibidem, No. 35."], [501, "47 TIBBERTON.

Of Baldwin son of Gilbert de Conedover I know nothing fur ther. In 1165 one Hugh de Cunedoure was holding a Muntator's fee in the Barony of Fitz Alan, but this, so far from being at or near Tibberton, was probably at Detton, in South Shropshire.1 After Baldwin de Conedover's grant in Tibberton to Shrewsbury Abbey, four hides of the Domesday Manor remained in lay hands. We know that Pantulf of Wem had the Seigneury of all four, and that Pantulf of Dawley was Tenant-in-fee of three out of the four.

The De fendants had called the Abbot of Shrewsbury to warranty, but, on their losing the land, the Abbot gave them 2| merks, which they acknowledge in a Deed, attested by Gilbert de Weston, Ralph Marescall and Richard Meverel, Clerk.3 Possibly the successful btigant in this suit was identical with Alice de Mumerville (Morville), whose grant of a virgate in Tibber ton to Lilleshall Abbey is recited in Henry III.'s confirmation of 1265. Between the years 1283 and 1290 Ralph Abbot of Lilleshall grants to Adam surnamed Garleck, a virgate in Tybrigton, which William Fitz Geoffrey sometime held.

At the Forest Assize of 1180, Edric, Huctred, and William, three freeholders in Tibreton, were assessed Is. each for pourpresture. Cadugan de Tybriton occurs as a Surety in 1226. About the year 1245 Reginald de Hales enfeoffs William de Morton (read Meston, i.e. Meeson) in two-thirds of a virgate in Tibberton, being part of the free tenement which the Grantor had in that Vill. The Grantor reserves all forinsec service, due on such a quantity of land, and also a proportion of Castle-guard at Wem, that is, the Tenant was to provide one serviens on foot, in time of war, with bow and arrows for two-thirds of a week. The Grantor further reserves an annual rent of 5s. 4c.. and a similar sum for Relief. For this the Grantee paid 3 merks. Witnesses, Hugh fitz Robert, John de Hales, Adam fitz Pagan.1 The same Grantor, whom I take to have been an Undertenant of John de Hales, seems also to have enfeoffed Adam Garlec in one-third of a virgate, at a rent of 2s. About the year 1255, \u2014 The son of the above Grantee, calling himself \" William son of Reginald de Parva Hales,\" sold, for 4 merks, to James son of William de Morton, the rent of 5s. 4c.. which he was entitled to receive from William de Morton (read Meston) . Witnesses, Robert de Wodecote, Jurdan de Pivelesdon, Hugh de Eton, William de Mokeleston, Michael de Morton, Richard de Cherinton, Richard Bernard, John de Parva Hales, &c. The same William son of Reginald sold to the same James the rent of 2s. which he was entitled to receive from Adam Garlec. Witnesses, Hugh de Eton, Michael de Morton, Richard Bernard of Cherinton, Robert de Wodecote, &c. About 1270-80, James son of William de Morton gave to Wom bridge Priory the above rents of 5s. 4c?. and 2s., which he had pur chased from William fitz Reginald. For this the Canons of Wom bridge received him into their fraternity and into participation of all benefits of their House for ever. Witnesses, Sir Odo de Hodnet, Sir John fitz Hugh, Sir John de Ercalew. By another Deed, probably of the same date, the same James gives to the Priory the virgate itself which he had bought from William son of Reginald de Halis.

However William de Morton (Meston) and Adam Gar lec gave respectively 3 merks and one merk for quitclaims to one nocate and one-third of half a virgate in Tibberton which they had respectively purchased from Reginald de Haylis. These Quit claims bear date at Wellington on Nov. 8, 1293. The Quitclaim ants are Richard de Trilwardyn, John de Buldewas, and Richard son of Thomas de Horton. Their Deeds are attested by Michael de Morton, William de Kaynton, William Rondolf of Newport, and William de Pixley. William de Meston's tenure of \u00a7 virgate descended to William Mille, who on August 1, 1383, gave it to Sir Henry Moday, Vicar of Leighton, subject to the Wombridge rent of 5s. 4c?. On August 27, 1383, Henry Moday transferred the same, Hable to the said rent, to Sir Bartholomew de Grenhull, Chaplain. Adam Garlec's tenure of \u00a3 virgate descended to Richard Garlec, who on October 21, 1383, gave it to Sir Bartholomew de Grenhull, Chaplain, subject to the Wombridge rent of 2s. Thus, on the whole, Wombridge Priory had the Seigneury, or 7s. 4c.. rent from a virgate in Tibberton, of which Bartholomew de Grenhull became the sole teuant. In the Valor of 1534-5 the Wombridge receipts from Tibberton are classed with those from Cherrington and Sherlow, as will appear elsewhere. It would have interfered with the sequence of the above Deeds to have quoted in order of \"date a Fine of Trinity Term 1283, whereby Robert de Tibberton enfeoffs Richard Byde in a messuage and half virgate in Tibberton, for an annual rent of 15c.. Tibberton Chapel. Parochially Tibberton was a member of Edgmond, and so its Chapel was a mere dependency of Edgmond Church. The antiquity of this Chapel was however considerable, for I take it that Drio, Priest of Tibberton, who attests a Deed be tween 1175 and 1180, was Chaplain here. There is no mention of this Chapel or its Curates either in the early Diocesan Registers or the Ecclesiastical Surveys."], [505, "51 button.

Here is a Mill, rendering 8 measures of corn. The (annual) value (of the Manor) was and is 25s.\"1 The ancient division of the Hundreds of Recordine and Odenet was, in this instance, the River Tern. Thus Sutton, though it was parochially a member of Market Drayton, was not, like Market Drayton, in Odenet Hundred, but in Recordine. The Mill noticed in Domesday was probably on the Tern, a little North-East of Bun tingsdale. Opposite to Sutton and North of the Tern was the Manor of Little Drayton, also held by the Countess Godiva in Saxon times. It was perhaps with reference to Little Drayton that Sutton or South toivn was so called. It is necessary to mark these particulars : for the once important Manor of Sutton could hardly otherwise be identified with the modern Township. The probable reason of its changed importance is to be found in the fact of Roger de Corcelle's Manors passing to Pantulf of Wem. These Barons were Seigneural Lords of Market Drayton and were occasionally resident at their adjacent Manor of Tirley, where they had a Castle. Sutton seems gradually to have lost its distinct status as a Manor, and its four Domesday hides to have been nearly absorbed by adjacent Manors. That which was recog nized as Sutton in 1284-5, was probably but a section of the original territory. Whatever its extent, we have seen that it was part of the great feoffment which Peter de Eyton then held under the Barons of Wem.3 Of Sutton in any later or more distinct relation, I cannot say a word.

Philip de Buntanesdene sat as a Juror on that Inquisition of 1220 which has been noticed under Dodicote.1 Alan de Buntanes dale occurs on a Chetwynd Inquest in April 1281. The Bradford Tenure-Roll of 1285 mentions Buntansdale as a member of the Barony of Wem. The said Alan held it by knight's service, viz. by service of half a knight's-fee. Thomas de Buntansdale occurs as a Juror in an Inquest of 1300. CLIFF GRANGE. This member of Sutton was anciently called Clive. Under that name it was given by Ivo Pantulf and his son, Brice, to Combermere Abbey,3 and in the time of Henry II. Other particulars, involved in the grant, will appear under Wem. About the year 1235 the Monks of Combermere increased their estate here by purchasing from Yvo Meverel, a Tenant of the Pan tulfs, all the land which the said Yvo had between Clive and Sutton. The Monks gave in exchange to Yvo Meverel, half a virgate which they had at Longford, near Moreton Say. The Deed of exchange shall be fully set forth under Longford. On October 6, 1242, Simon Abbot of Combermere having ap parently impleaded Ralph le Butiler and his wife Matilda (Baroness of Wem) for warranty of the \" Manor of Clyve,\" a Fine was levied at Westminster, whereby Ralph and Matilda conceded the Abbot's demand, and were made participators in the benefits of his House for ever. The Abbot was to be responsible for all royal services due on the land. John de Clive, who occurs about 1270, was perhaps a Tenant here under the Abbot of Combermere. The estate remained with the Abbey till its Dissolution ; but the Valor of 1535 seems to in clude it with Chesthill or Ternhill.

Now it is worth 30s. 2\\d.,n My reason for treating here of the Recordin Manors which were held by Roger de Laci is because this one was subsequently an nexed to the Barony of Pantulf. Conversely, we have seen that two of Pantulf's Manors in South Shropshire (Middleton Higford and Upper Ledwich) fell to the fief of De Laci.3 I am far how ever from thinking that there was any direct exchange between Pantulf and De Laci, or that Pantulf's gain of the seigneury of Waters Upton was cotemporary with his surrender of certain Manors in South Shropshire. It must be remembered, according to what has been said under Ludlow, that, for a great part of the interval between 1108 and 1155, De Laci's Barony was an Escheat, and that Henry II.'s Charter to Hugh De Laci does not give or restore Upton Parva. Again it must be remembered how, during the later years of Henry I., Pagan fitz John seems to have had the dominant interest in Laci's Fief. Now we are told that Pagan fitz John gave \" Uptune\" to Gilbert de Conedoure, in considera tion of the said Gilbert having resigned some Prebendal lands to St. Alkmund's, of which lands Pagan fitz John had since obtained reversionary possession.3 It is very probable, all things considered, that Upton Parva was the Manor here spoken of, for it adjoined Tibberton, which we know to have belonged to Gilbert de Cone doure, or at least to his son after him. If so, Pagan fitz John was Seigneural Lord of Upton Parva at the close of Henry I.'s reign, and Gilbert de Conedovre was his Tenant. That Seuuard, the Domesday Tenant, should have ceased to be represented at Upton is far from surprising. Seuuard was probably a Saxon, or rather one of those Freeholders of the Pr\u00e6-Norman \u00e6ra, whose few Domes day estates are never to be traced to their heirs. How Pantulf obtained the Seigneury of Upton Parva, or how all probable descendants of Gilbert de Conedoure disappeared from the tenancy, I will not surmise. The first fact is certain, viz. that Pan tulf did obtain the Seigneury ; the last fact is rendered probable by 3 Monasticon, VII. 750, Num. XVI. I Vide supra, p. 47. 1 Domesday, so. 256, b, 1. - Supra, Vol. V. pp. 84, 85."], [508, "54 WATERS UPTON. analogy; for Gilbert de Conedoure's heirs disappeared also from Tibberton ; and Pantulf enfeoffed a relation of his own there. This brings us to the inquiry as to who became Pantulf's Feoffee at Upton Parva? Walter fitz John, whom we have seen following Ivo Pantulf, then Baron of Wem, in the testing clause of a Charter,1 was I be lieve the individual in question. I further believe that it was he who gave to this place its distinctive name of Walter's Upton, now corrupted into Waters Upton. The Deed alluded to passed about 1155-58, but, as I have said under Great Lyth,3 Walter fitz John was living in October 1200 and deceased in April 1201. By his wife Richildis, who predeceased him, Walter fitz John obtained an estate at Whittingslow, of which more shall be said hereafter. He left two children, Matilda wife of Herbert fitz Alan, alias Her bert de Abacun, and a son and heir, \u2014 William fitz Walter, who occurs in 1200, 1201, and 1203, in various relations,3 but not in connection with Upton. In the last year he appears as a Knight. The Pipe-Roll of 1207 records an amercement of half a merk against William fitz Walter. I think that he was deceased in 1223, and that the following grant to Haughmond Abbey was made late in his life. As WiUiam son of Walter de Uptone he gave to that House a certain meadow in Up tone, called Longeie, bounded in one direction by a meadow belong ing to Uptone Chapel. He also gave tithe of all tolls taken in his Mill of Uptone. Witnesses, Baldwin de Hodenet, William de Ercalew, Hugh Forester (of Bolas probably), Reginald de Time, Ralph son of Hugh de Seynton ; Walter, Philip, and Nicholas, the Grantor's sons, &c.4 Walter de Upton, son and heir of William fitz Walter, occurs as a Witness as early as 1223. His position in 1226-7 has been noticed under Great Lyth and under Pulverbatch.6 The Pipe- Roll of 1231 records an amercement of 5 merks against him for hunting without license in the Forest. I suppose it to have been him who, as Walter de Hupiton, is recorded to have given a meadow of his demesne, called Eilmersheia, to Wombridge Priory.6 The Feodary of 1240 enters Walter de Hopton or Upton as holding a knight's-fee in Hopton or Upton, of the Barons of Wem.7 The interest of the family at Whittingslow would seem to have gone to his younger 1 *2 Supra, Vols.

CaDing himself \" Nycholas de Upton juxta Crugelton, he concedes to Haghmon Abbey, Longeye meadow, which William son of Walter de Upton had before given.

Witnesses, Sir William de Hedleg, Hugh fitz Robert, Ma doc de Sutton, William de Time, Reginald de Time, William Wiscard, William Crasset of Halecton (Haughton).\"3 Nicholas de Upton was also a benefactor to Shrewsbury Abbey. For the souls' health of himself and his wife he bequeaths together with his body to that House, an annual rent of 5s., receivable from Robert son of the Parson of Bolas and his heirs ; \u2014 the said rent to be applied to the use of the Convent kitchen. He further bequeaths 3 acres of his own demesne and the right of patronage of his Chapel of Upton. Witnesses, Sir Hugh fitz Robert, Sir William de Erka lewe, Ralph de Crugelton, and John de Salop, Clerks.3 It is certain that the above Deeds passed between 1240 and 1248, in which interval we therefore conclude Nicholas de Upton to have died.4 I cannot tell in what way Waters Upton now went to Co parceners, for it would appear that persons of the name of Upton succeeded to Nicholas de Upton at Whittingslow. The following Deeds, if I am right in dating them about 1250, show who Nicholas de Upton's immediate successors were at Waters Upton. \u2014 1. Reginald de Hupton son of Reginald de Tyrne and William de Tyrne son of William de Tyrne confirm and ratify to Shrewsbury Abbey the donation and concession which Nicholas, formerly Lord of Hupton, had made, viz. the Advowson of Hupton Chapel in the Parish of Erkelowe, with 3 acres of land in Hupton and 5s. annual rent. Witnesses, Sir William de Erkelowe, knight ; Reginald de Tyrne ; Richard de Tyrne.5 2. Reginald son of Reginald de Tyrne gives three acres in the vill of Uptone to the same Abbey.

They were probably Cousins and had married two Sisters, in whose right one at least of them was thus seized of property before his father's death.3 It is clear that some one of the documents which should enable us to trace the mode of this Coparcenery is erroneous. I suspect it to be the Hundred-Roll of 1255, which instead of Reginald fitz Reginald gives William fitz Reginald as a Coparcener in Upton. I think that Reginald fitz Reginald was living 16 years afterwards, and that William fitz Reginald was a fictitious personage. The said Hundred- Roll says that Ralph le Botiler did suit to both County and Hundred, through his Seneschal, for the whole of his Barony except Upton and Eiton. It is further stated with regard to Hopton (i.e. Upton) that, \" William fitz Reginald held one moiety of the Manor and William de Time the other moiety. They held it by service of one Knight at Wem, for 40 days, at their own cost in time of war.\" The wonted Suit of the Manor to County and Hundred was deemed to be worth 2s. per annum ,- but it had been withdrawn 9 years before ;4 that is, I think, soon after Nicholas de Upton's death. There was a William de Upton, Juror on a Rodington Inquest in 1274, and on a Withington Inquest in 1283. That he was the se cond of the Coparceners named in 1255 seems certain. In a Fiue of July 1283 he is, I think, the person called William de Tyrne of Opton, whose wife, here called Agatha, was evidently a Coheiress, and had brought him some property at Eaton-upon-Tern. Before this, William de Tytnele had obtained ingress into the Manor of Upton; for, by a Fine of November 1272, Thomas de Honton, having claimed, under a Writ of mort d'ancestre, a messuage, a virgate, and 3s. rent, in Upton Water, against WUliam de Tytnele (Tenant thereof), renounced his said claim for 7 merks. The Brad ford Tenure-RoU (circa 1285) gives Upton as a member of the Barony of Wem, and William Tyteley as holding the same by ser vice of one knight's-fee. 1 * 2 Salop Chartulary, Nos. 120, 122. 3 An Inquest of 1249 was attended by Reginald de Time, William de Time, and Reginald de Upton.

He accounts as Sheriff of Shropshire for the year ending Michaelmas 1290, and thenceforward till about Midsummer 1295, when, he being dead, his son, Thomas, takes up the current year's account as his heir.1 Whatever it was, whether mesne-estate, or fee-simple, or both, which William de Titley had obtained in Upton, it is clear from the Assize- Roll of 1292, that the previous Coparcerners were still represented there. The Jurors of Bradford Hundred stated how King Henry III. had sometime been seized of 2s. per annum for the stretward and motfee of the vill of Upton Water ,-\u2014 how the said due had been withdrawn ; \u2014 and how the present tenants of the ViU were profiting by the withdrawal. The said tenants were Wil liam de Upton and Agnes his wife, Richard de Upton and Dionysia his wife, and Adam de Upton and Emma his wife. These persons, not appearing, were summoned to be at Lichfield on January 27, 1293. How these Coparceners of 1292 represented those of 1255, it is difficult to say. I suspect that Richard de Up ton had been aU along a coparcener in right of his wife Dionysia, and that he was the person who attests the Deeds of 1250, and who occurs in 1271, as Richard de Tyrne. I further think that William de Upton was identical with \" William de Tyrne son of WUliam de Tyrne\" of 1250, with \"WiUiam de Time\" of 1255, and with \" WUliam de Tyrne of Opton \" of 1283. His wife Agnes too, who is so caUed in 1256 and 1292, must be identical with her who is called Agatha in 1283. The third Coheiress, Emma, I take to have been wife of Reginald fitz Reginald from 1250 to 1271, secondly of William Bolace of Eaton in 1283, and thirdly of Adam de Upton in 1292. Some facts justifying at least a part of these surmises wUl appear under Eaton and under Tern. I may name among Undertenants of this Manor, or perhaps ca dets of the family of Upton, the following. \u2014 Peter de Upton attests a Pulverbatch Deed about 1190.3 Ano ther Peter de Upton sat on a Lee-Cumbray Inquest in 1249,3 and on an Inquest as to the value of Bradford Hundred in 1264. THE CHURCH. The Church of Waters Upton was originally a Chapel, founded 1 Sheriffs of Shropshire, pp. 8, 9 (cor- I rected from the Pipe-Rolls). 2 Supra, Vol. VI. p. 190. 3 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 343. 8 VIII."], [512, "58 WATERS UPTON. in the Saxon Parish of High Ercall, and founded probably by the Lacies while yet they had the seigneury of the Manor. Under no other supposition can I account for this Church being subject to a Pension to the Priory of St. Guthlac at Hereford. This association of ideas has already been explained.1 We have had mention of this Chapel about 1220, and have seen its Advowson given to Shrewsbury Abbey about 1245. The Abbey, be it observed, had already the patronage of the Mother Church at High Ercall. The Church-Taxation of 1291 does not value this Chapel at all, but gives St. Guthlac's Pension of 2s. as receivable therefrom.3 In 1341 the Chapelry of Upton Parva was assessed at 16s. to the Ninth. There had been a murrain among the sheep and a failure of corn-crops.3 In the Valor of 1534-5 the Preferment of Roger Henson, Rector of Upton Parva, is put at \u00a34, chargeable with 2s. for procurations and 10^c?. for synodals.4 It is remarkable that this Church should have been reputed as in the Deanery of Newport, whilst the Mother- Church of High Ercall was in the Deanery of Shrewsbury. This is a strong argument against the antiquity of the Ruri-decanal divisions of the Diocese, an argument which I shall be able to strengthen by other considerations in future chapters. EARLY INCUMBENTS. Peter, Parson of Upton, was found dead in his bed, as reported by the Bradford Jurors at the Assizes of 1256. He had been bu ried without View of the Coroner, an omission for which the Vills of Upton, Crudgington, Rowton, and Cold-Hatton were answerable. John le Enfaunt, being dead on January 27, 1310, \u2014 Master John de Bruneshope was instituted to Opton at pre sentation of the Abbot and Convent of Salop ; \u2014 who likewise pre sented in the following instances. \u2014 Sir Robert Ridel resigning the Curative Chapel of Upton Parva, on June 29, 1318, \u2014 Sir John de Hatton, Chaplain, was admitted on July 14 fol lowing.

I have said much under Stokesay, of that family of Say which was so largely enfeoffed in the Shropshire Manors of De Lacy.3 \u2014 Theodoric de Say, the first of this family, was Lacy's Tenant at Stoke upon Tern.

It seems to have been Theodoric de Say who is mentioned only by his Christian name in another affair of Shrewsbury Abbey. The Abbey had demised to one Elieth a hide of land, probably at Woolerton or Stoke. On Elieth's death, his son Rainald surren dered this land to Abbot Godfrey, so frankly and entirely that the Abbot gave him \u00a310. 10s. in the presence of many witnesses, to wit, in the presence of his (Rainald's) Lord, Theodoric, by whose good offices the above agreement had been brought about ; \u2014 also of Hamo Peverel and Warin his Sewer, of William, a knight of the aforesaid Theodoric, of William Cook, and of Meriet, and Weret, servants of the Abbot.1 The date of this transaction was probably between 1121 and 1127, and it is the last authentic notice which I can adduce of Theodoric de Say. He has been erroneously repre sented as successor of Picot de Say, Baron of Clun (with whom he had nothing to do hereditarily), as also a Grantor of land in Stoke say to Salop Abbey (whereas his grant to that House was in Stoke upon Tern), and further as Ancestor of the Says of Richards Castle3 (of which there is no existing evidence and no probability). Theo doric was in fact only a Tenant under De Lacy, though a very con siderable one. Helias de Say (I.) (probably son and successor of Theodoric) occurs, as we have seen under Stokesay, from 1138 to 1165, when Stoke upon Tern undoubtedly constituted a part of the knight's fees which the said Helias held under Hugh de Lacy. Before the year 1172 Elyas de Say with consent of Hugh his son gave half a hide in Hoppton to Haughmond Abbey, and was otherwise a bene factor to that House. The grant in Hoppton is certified in Pope Alexander's Bull of 1172. The place alluded to was Hopton near Hodnet, and the land given was undoubtedly that same half-hide which Domesday had described, under the name of Hotune, as a Berewick of Stoke upon Tern. Hugh de Say, son and heir of Helias, occurs from 1174 to 1194. The Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 1176 records against him an amerce ment of 5 merks, because one, for whose appearance he was bail, was not forthcoming. In November 1194 Hugh de Say's name appears on the Essoign-Rolls in a significant way. He had, it seems, 1 Salop Chartulary, No. 1. 2 Dugdale's Baronage, I. 453."], [515, "STOKE UPON TERN. 61 a dispute about some woodland with Fulk de Ori or de Aili. The dispute was evidently with his neighbour, Fulk d'Oiri of Childs Er call. William French and, William fitz Simon were Attorneys in the Suit.1 Helias de Say (IL), son and heir of Hugh de Say by his wife Olympias, occurs from about 1195 till 1216 or after. The Fine, whereby he settled the dower of his mother, bears date on September 26, 1199. Olympias first renounces all her claim in Sudstok (Stoke say), Nordstok (Stoke upon Tern), Morton (Moreton Say), and other estates of her late husband. Helias in return commits to his mother, the whole Manor of Nordestok, \u2014 to hold of him and his heirs by the free service of 2s., in lieu of aU, except forinsec, ser vices, and in the name of dower. Two-thirds of the Bosc called La Haie are reserved by Helias ; but Olympias and her men were to have easements in the whole of that Bosc. Also Olympias was to have a full third part of the Bosc of Morton and of the pannage receivable from both Boses. Helias de Say died about the year 1222. Calling himself \" son of Hugh de Say,\" with the consent of his heirs he grants to Haughmond Abbey together with his body, for the souls' health of himself, his wife Avice, and all his relations, a rent of one merk receivable yearly at Michaelmas, viz. 12s. 4c?. from the land of Blecheslee, held by William fitz Nicholas of Ble cheslee, and 12c?. from land which Hugh de Stuche held.

Robert de Say, brother and heir of Helias, was not, what the above Charters seem to imply, and what I have inadvertently1 stated him to have been, \u2014 a Clerk in Holy Orders. Helias de Say (II.) left two brothers named Robert, one a Clerk, the other a knight, and his heir. It was the knight who as \" Robert de Say \" con firmed to Haughmond the donation which Helyas de Say his brother made of a merk rent in Norstoke, with his body. Witnesses, Bald win de Hodnet ; Stephen his brother ; Vivian de Roshall ; Thomas his son; WiUiam de Herchalew; Stephen de Pimbel; Philip de Penintun, &c.3 This confirmation, being of date about 1224, is foUowed by a Patent of August 29, 1228, when it appears that the Abbot of Com bermere was suing Robert de Say for common-pasture in Stoke. Walter de Say, brother and heir of Robert, was succeeded, as I have before shown, by his nephew, Hugh. The Fine by which, in 1250, Walter entailed the two Stokes on Hugh, has also been given,3 but there is an indorsement to that Fine, stating that Odo de Hodenet opposed his claim in regard of 62 acres of land and the Advowson of North-Stoke ; and that Hugh de Pecchesey, Rees, and Egelina de Kungunde simUarly opposed their claim. With respect to Hugh de Say and his alienation of Stoke upon Tern to John de Verdon, the Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 speaks thus. \u2014 \" Stoke with its appurtenances is four hides, and pays 16c?. stret ward, and 16c?. motfee. John Verdon, Lord of the Vill, holds Stok by exchange (with) Hugh de Say in Ireland ; and it is one knight's fee, of the Fee of Ludlow; and it provides one knight, with his charges, in time of war at Shrawardine Castle. And in the same Fee, Hugh de Heton provides one horseman for 40 days at Shrawardine Castle, at his own charges.

Again, when Stoke is said to be \" of the Fee of Ludlow,\" nothing more is meant than that it was a member of the Barony heretofore held by Lacy of Ludlow. John de Verdon was a Coheir of that Barony and already Seigneuial Lord of Stoke, when he purchased the Tenant-interest of Hugh de Say by an equivalent of lands in Ireland. The falling-off from seven hides (the Domesday contents of Stoke) to four hides, I can not explain. Perhaps the early conveyance of Stoke Grange to Shrewsbury Abbey may account for part of the discrepancy. The Inquest held on Nov. 7, 1274, on the death of John de Verdon, was, as I have explained, held at Stoke upon Tern, though the Manor is described as Stokesay.1 John de Verdon's interest in the capital Manor was only \u00a36. 12s. per annum, arising from 2 carucates of land, a messuage and curtilage, a Mill and diverse rents. The Advowson of the Church, worth 30 merks per annum to its Incumbent, was his also.3 The Feodaries of 1284-5 give a full list of the members of Stoke upon Tern, \u2014 called in one instance Stoke-Say, in the other Sloke-Lacy. The members were AUerton (now OUerton), Eton, Wystaneswyk, Stoke- Aubry, Wodehus, Heselschawe (Helshaw), Pe chesay (now Petsey), Morton Say, Stuche (Stych), Blecheley, Aide ley, Oldefeld, Hull, Waranshall, and Parrok (now Park).3 Theo bald de Verdon held the whole, of the King in capite, as a member of his Barony of Ludlow. At the Assizes of 1292 Theobald de Verdon's exercise of Free- Warren in Stok was noticed by the Bradford Jurors. Theobald de Verdon (I.) died at his Castle of Alveton on Sunday, August 24, 1309 ; and was buried at Croxden Abbey on Oct. 12, foUowing. His eldest son John had died in Ireland, with out issue, on June 13, 1297. Theobald de Verdon (IL), who now succeeded to his Father, had been knighted by King Edward on June 24, 1298, in which year he came into England from Ireland. On July 29, 1302, he had been married at Wigmore to Matilda daughter of Edmund, Lord Mortimer. In the Nomina Villarum of March 1316, Theobald de Verdon stands as Lord of Stoke super Tyrne. For the short but brilliant but constituted the Domesday Manor of Moreton. It is easy to see how Moreton and Stoke came to be thus rearranged. Both were De Lacy's, and both were held under De Lacy by De Say. 1 Supra, Vol. V. p. 35, note 23. 2 Inquisitions, 2 Edw.

The Inquest on his death values the Manor of Stoke upon Tern, at \u00a39. 15s. 10c?. per annum, out of which 13s. 4c?. was payable to the Abbot of Haghmon and 5s. to the Parson of the Church of Stoke; \u2014 leaving a net value of \u00a38. 17s. 6c..3 In the division of the Verdon estates, Stoke upon Tern fell to Ebzabeth, second daughter of Theobald de Verdon (IL), by Ma tUda de Mortimer his first wife. The said Elizabeth was only ten years of age at the time of her Father's death. Hence an Es cheator's Roll of 19 Edw. II. (1325-6) gives Stok super Tym as in manu Regis. But in 1328 it was allotted to the aforesaid Elizabeth, then the wife of Bartholomew de Burghersh. In 1329 the said Bartholomew had a grant of Free Warren in all his demesne lands here. However there must have been subsequently a redistribution of the Verdon estates or else an exchange among the Coheirs, for Stoke upon Tern is found soon afterwards in possession of Henry Lord Ferrers of Groby, who died seized thereof in 1343. This Henry Lord Ferrers had married Isabel fourth daughter and co heir of Theobald de Verdon (II.) . The said Isabel's mother was Elizabeth, daughter of GUbert de Clare Earl of Gloucester (by the Princess Joan of Acres), and widow of Richard de Burgh, Earl'of Ulster. Elizabeth de Clare had become the second wife of Theo bald de Verdon in February 1316, and the above Isabel, his post humous daughter, seems to have been bom on March 21, 1317. With the descendants of Henry Lord Ferrers and the said Isabel, I must now leave the Seigneury of the Manor of Stoke. The only Undertenant whom I shall name here, as associated with the central Manor, was Elyas de Stoke who occurs on various Jury-lists and Testing-clauses from 1253 to 1274. At the Assizes of 1256 he was a Juror for Bradford Hundred, and shortly before the year 1264 he was Bailiff of the said Hundred, forming it under the Sheriff for a rent of 15 merks per annum, whilst he is said to have realized only 8 merks himself.3 He married, about the year 1263, PetronUla widow of Roger de Leaton.4 He was succeeded by a son, Robert.

The earliest Feoffee here, of whom I have any note, was William, apparently a younger son of the first Peter de Eyton of Eyton. In addition to what I have said of this William under Eyton, I here give an abstract of the Deed which connects him at once with Eaton upon Tern, and which must have passed about 1223. \u2014 \" Sciant presentes, fye. ego Williel mus filius Petri de Eton dedi, fye.

Among the items thus granted was the \"meadow which he had from William de Eton.\" I find this William de Eyton, with his name so written, attesting a Wombridge Deed which must have passed before 1224. In August 1226, as William de Eton, he ap pears as Surety for one Syward de Wythiford. At the same As sizes William Hodinet was adjudged to pay 5s. damages for having unjustly disseized WiUiam de Ethon of a free tenement in Ethon.3 WUliam de Hodnet, I should observe, was at this time Guardian of his infant nephew, Odo son of Baldwin de Hodnet.3 We have several subsequent hints of a Tenant-interest possessed by the Hod nets in Stoke, so that the above collision with WiUiam de Ethon would seem not to be too arbitrarily assigned to the locality now under notice. The Pipe-Roll of 1231 exhibits Hamo de Etun-juxta- Boelwas as amerced 4s. for some default. I must leave it a ques tion whether the William de Eton who occurs so frequently as a Juror or Witness between the years 1242 and 1249 was of Eaton upon Tern. I incline to think that WiUiam, Lord of Eyton, ne phew of William de Eaton, was the person who thus appears. My reason is this. A Bolas Inquest and a Lee Cumbray Inquest, both taken in the year 1249, were attended, the first by William de Etun as Juror, the last by Hugh de Eyton. We are sure that Hugh de Eyton was son and heir of WUliam de Eaton, and Lord 1 Wombridge Chartulary, Tit. Eton j super Time, No. iij. ' VIII. 2 Abbrev. Placitorum, p. 103. 3 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 56. 9"], [520, "66 STOKE UPON TERN. of Eaton upon Tern. His father therefore was probably dead at this time, and his cotemporary Juror must needs have been his Cousin, the Lord of Eyton. In 1255 we have seen on the clearest evidence that Hugh de Heton was Lord of Eaton upon Tem. His service too for this member of Stoke has been set forth.1 We have seen him attesting Tibberton Deeds of the same period.3 At the Assizes of 1256 he was one of the Elizors for Bradford Hundred. In June 1260 he occurs as a Juror in an Inquest at Sheriff Hales. At the Forest Pleas of 1262, as Hugh de Eton, he appears as a Regarder of the Wrekin Forest. The latest-dated mention of his name is in May 1264, when he was second of the Jurors who reported as to the value and previous disposal of the King's Hundred of Bradford. We are now in a condition to assign the date and to estimate the relevance of the following Deed, it being remembered that Dodi cote, the next estate to Eaton, belonged to Combermere Abbey. \u2014 \" Hugo fitz William, Lord of Eton, gives to the Blessed Mary of Cumbermere and to the Monks thereof, a piece of ground, near their meadow of Plachay, sufficient to dry their hay upon, whenever they should choose to mow the said meadow. He also gives them the free and customary right of road, through his land, for carrying the said hay. Witnesses, Master Robert de Stokes, WiUiam Kry nerant, Alexander Bosse, Richard Porter, Robert de Blunham.\"3 This Deed probably passed between 1248 and 1270, but I can-, not trace anything further of the Tenant-in-fee at Eaton for some years. I therefore revert for the present to notices of some minor tenancies. There was a Hugh de Bosco, Juror on a Bolas Inquest in 1249. He was, I believe, of Eaton. On October 27, 1262, Richard son of Dionysia de Lega and Ma tilda his wife, acknowledge themselves, by Fine, to have given half a virgate in Eton to John de Whethamsted, who is to hold the same under the Lords of the Fee. For this, which was probably a mere sale, John paid 5| merks. There is no reason to doubt that a se cond sale4 of another parcel of land by the same parties was cotem porary. In this case the purchaser was their own Suzerain. \u2014 \" Richard de Lega of Eton, with assent of Matilda his wife, sells and concedes to Sir John de Verdon, Lord of Stoke, the whole moiety of a half-virgate in the vill of Eton which Hugh Clerk for merly held ; likewise a meadow called Croftmedewe, when a current 1 * 2 Supra, pp. 62, 49. | 3 . 4 Charters at Adderley."], [521, "67 EATON UPON TERN. term of 4 years should have expired : \u2014 to hold of the Grantor and his wife and their heirs at a rent of one halfpenny. For this John de Verdon paid 2 merks. Witnesses, Robert de Heselsawe (Hel shaw), Henry de Pech (Petsey), Elyas de Stoke, Hugh de Eton, William fitz Gilbert of Wistaneswik, &c.\" Between the years 1270 and 1280 Thomas Corbet of Hadley was in receipt of the glove-rent, due to the heirs or assigns of William de Eaton, from the heirs or assigns of Geoffrey Griffin, for that meadow in Eaton which was now held by Wombridge Priory. Thomas Corbet quit-claimed the said rent to Walter Prior of Wombridge, in a Deed attested by Sir John de Ercalew, Sir John fitz Hugh, Robert de Heselwawe (Helshaw), Hugh de Bolinhall, Peter de Eyton, Adam de Preston and Ranulph le Bret. This Deed further gives the Prior facilities for enclosing the said mea dow, and carrying the hay thereof through any adjoining land of the Grantor.1 It is obvious I think that Thomas Corbet of Had ley was at this period Lord of Eaton and representative of William de Eaton and his son Hugh ; but whether this position was Thomas Corbet's by purchase or by inheritance, and how he lost it, I cannot say. By a Fine of November 1272, Robert fitz Mabel and Margery his wife acknowledge themselves to have given a virgate in Etone, to WUliam fitz Robert, who is to hold the same of Robert and Mar gery and the heirs of Margery by a rose-rent, and by performance of all capital services. For this a sore sparrow-hawk was the osten sible consideration. I take the above William fitz Robert to be identical with Wil liam fitz Robert of Eyton who in July 1274 sat upon a Longford Inquest together with John de Bosco of Eyton. Who William de Eyton, a higher Juror on the same Inquest, can have been I will not attempt to decide. William fitz Robert of Eton occurs again as a Juror at Hatton Hyneheath in 1300. By a Fine of May 16, 1283, William Bolace of Eton and Emma his wife, acknowledge themselves to have given two-thirds of half a virgate in Eton to John fitz Adam of Derlaston and his wife Alina ; \u2014 to hold to John and Alina and the heirs of John, under William and Emma and the heirs of Emma, at a rose-rent and by perform ance of aU capital services. Moreover WiUiam and Emma allowed that the remaining third of the above half-virgate, being now held by WiUiam Dun as the dower of his wife Margaret, and being of Wombridge Chartulary, Tit. Eton super Time, No. ij."], [522, "68 STOKE UPON TERN. Emma's inheritance, should remain to John and Alina, as part of the present concession. WUliam and Margaret Dun were present and acknowledged their interest to be merely that of dower. For this Fine John and Alina paid 12^ merks. By another Fine of July 1, 1283, William de Tyrne of Opton and Agatha his wife, acknowledge themselves to have given to Thomas Aleyn of Rode two-thirds of a messuage and half-virgate in Eton juxta Bolewas, together with the reversion of another third, now held by William and Margaret Dun (as in the last Fine), and which would ordinarily revert to William and Agatha. A rose-rent to William and Agatha and the heirs of Agatha is reserved, and all capital services. Emma and Agatha, named in the above Fines, were obviously coheiresses of the deceased first husband of Margaret Dun.1 The Feodary of circa 1285, enumerates Eton among the mem bers of Stoke, and says further that William de Molventon held it under Theobald de Verdon. From William de Molventon the mesne-lordship passed to William de Heselshawe (Helshaw), who in the Inquest of 1317 is stated to hold half a knight's-fee in Eton, worth \u00a34 per annum, and of the estate of Theobald de Verdon (IL), deceased. Ollerton. Though this place is often mentioned as a member of Stoke I have very scanty notices of its tenure, and one such notice (presently to be mentioned) seems to associate it with Hop ton near Hodnet, or rather with that part of Hopton which was of the Fee of Lacy. Henry Moryce and Robert Forester of Alverton were reported by the Bradford Jurors as not in due attendance at the Assizes of 1292. I suppose it was Robert Forester's son who occurs about this time as \" Elyas son of Robert le Wodeward of Alvertone.\" To him did William Knotte of Alvertone give six seylions in the fields of Alvertone and half an acre of meadow, \u2014 charged with a penny rent to the Lord of the Fee. Witnesses, WUliam de Wistaneswyke, Robert Elye (i. e. fitz Elyas) of Stoke, Henry de Pechesey, WiUiam Parker (Parcario), and Henry Morisse of Alvertone.3 The Inquisition of 1317, just now quoted, states that \"the Tenants of Alverton and Hopton held of Theobald de Verdon (de- 1 I think too that the said first hus band of Margaret Dun, whatever was his name, was the person from whom the Co heirs of Waters Upton derived their title to that Manor (vide supra, pp. 55, 56). 2 Charter at Adderley. \u2014 [Hulfurlong, Radelford, Crowmeresmers, Edemorfor long, Le Heweorles, the boundary towards Peppelowe, and Hoverwothale, are locali ties named in this Deed.]"], [523, "WOODHOUSE, PARROK, PETSEY, HELSHAW. 69 ceased) half a knight's fee in Alverton and Hopton which was worth 60s. per annum.\" Who the Tenants alluded to were, I can not say, but conjecture that the cotemporary Lords of Hodnet and the Abbot of Haughmond were meant. We have had several allu sions to some tenure of the Hodnets under the Lords of Stoke, and I do not see why Ollerton or Alverton may not be taken to have been part of that tenure. Woodhouse. This member of Stoke adjoined OUerton. At the Assizes of November 1221, Baldwin de Hodnet and Laurence de Stoke, Chaplain, were found to have disseized William de Dounton and his wife Emma of a tenement in Wudehus. Damages of one merk were given ; but the misericordia of Laurence was pardoned, on account of his holy office, and on condition of his saying thirty masses for the soul of King John.1 Isabel de la Wodehouse, re ported as faiUng in attendance at the Assizes of 1292, was apparently of this place. Parrok, now Park, was a member of Stoke. Henry del Parrok was a Juror on the Inquest taken in March 1317 as to the Fees of Theobald de Verdon, deceased. Petsey. This member of Stoke also gave name to a family which held it. We have had notice above of Hugh de Pecchesey in 1250. Henry de Pechesey occurs in 1256-7, on a local Jury in 1284, and as a witness, later. Helshaw. Robert de Helshaw, apparently Verdon's tenant here, occurs on jury Lists and Testing Clauses from 1253 till 1278. The Westminster Plea-RoU of Easter Term 1271 exhibits Walter de Heselsehawe as fining one merk pro licentid concordandi with Robert de Heselsehaive. Their Suit, which was conventional, was settled by Final Concord. Thereby Robert de Heselshawe, deforciant, acknow ledges himself to have given a messuage and a carucate in Hesel shawe to Walter de Heselshawe, Plaintiff. The latter restores the premises to Robert, to hold for life at a rent of 20s., with remainder to Walter, to hold of the Lords of the Fee. This remainder pro bably took effect between the years 1278 and 1285, for about the latter period we are told that \" Master Walter de Helshaw holds the vUl of Helshaw under Theobald de Verdon.\" At the Assizes of 1292 the Bradford jurors presented Walter de Heselshawe as not in due attendance. William de Helshaw, who as we have seen, held Eaton upon Tern in 1317, probably held Helshaw also. 1 Assizes, 6 Hen. III., m. 3 dorso."], [524, "70 STOKE UPON TERN. THE CHURCH. Wistanswick.

PETER AT STOKE UPON TERN. This Church existed at Domesday and was probably one of the original Saxon Churches of the district. The next notice of this Church is implied in the Fine of 1250, wherein we see that the Hodnets had some claim to the Advowson.1 Such a claim, however it arose, was settled by a second Fine on Octo ber 13, 1254. Thereby Odo de Hodeneth renounced all claim to the Advowson of Northstokeshay , in favour of John de Verdoun, who paid 10 merks for the concession. In 1274 we have seen that this Church was reputed to be worth 30 merks per annum. The Taxa tion of 1291 places it in the Deanery of Newport and describes it as the Church of Stokesay, but only values it at 10 merks per annum? On the death of Theobald de Verdon (II.) in 1316 the Advowson was found to have been his, and the same value of the Rectory was returned by Inquest. The Assessors of the Ninth in 1341 quoted the Church Taxation of Stoke super Teyrn as 10 merks.3 They rated the Parish only at 8 merks, because 2 merks of the Taxation arose from glebe land and other Church profits, not computable in the current assessment. The Valor of 1534-5 gives the preferment of WUliam Hille, Clerk, Rector of Stoke upon Tyrn as \u00a321 per annum (viz.

He died in 1386, when on February 27 \u2014 Richard de Humburston was instituted at the presentation of Sir Henry de Ferrars, Lord of Groby. On AprU 30, 1394 \u2014 Thomas Corbet, Rector of Stoke, exchanged preferments with \u2014 William Hamynet, Priest, late Vicar of Ercall. The King was Patron of Stoke on this occasion. Hamynet died in 1413. kittle WmWtot** This was a divided Manor at Domesday.

Their subsequent history is very distinct. During the forfeiture of the House of Lacy, and while this moiety of Little Withiford was at the disposal of the Crown, it happened that the adjacent Manor of Shawbury was in the Crown also. So Lacy's estate was annexed to Shawbury, and was never afterwards restored to Lacy. way account for his thus presenting to Stoke upon Tern. 1 Sir John de Ludlow was heir of the Hodnets, the ancient claimants of this Advowson. This does not however in any - Domesday, so. 256, b, 1."], [526, "72 LITTLE WITHIFORD. It is observable that Robert, Lacy's Domesday Tenant at Little Withiford, was also Gerard de Tomai's Tenant in Besford and in part of Preston Brockhirst : and that Besford and part of Preston Brockhirst subsequently escheated to the Crown and became parcels of Shawbury, as granted to Thomas de Erdington by King John. The inference is that Robert or his successors were involved in the forfeitures of Henry I.'s time or else that his tenure lapsed in some other way to the Suzerain. When King John granted Shawbury cum pertinenciis to Thomas de Erdington, Lacy's share of Little Withy ford seems to have ac companied the grant as a matter of course. In 1227, as we shaU see under Shawbury, the Widow of Thomas de Erdington, disposing of her dower in Shawbury and Besford, disposed also of her dower in Little Withyford as part and parcel of the same estate. In or about the year 1285 Ivo de Sulton was holding half Little Withiford, as a member of Shawbury. He held it under Matilda widow of Henry de Erdington who then had Shawbury in dower. I have nothing further to say of Laci's share of Little Withiford, except what will be stated or implied in my general account of Shawbury. As to Ivo de Sulton he will recur to us under another locality. I now revert to the other share of Little Withiford. This, toge ther with Withington, was held at Domesday under Earl Roger, by Fulcuius. \u2014 \" The same Fulcuius holds Wideford. Godric held it (in Saxon times) . Here is half a hide. The (arable) land is (enough) for n ox-teams. Here is one team ; and it (the Manor) pays a ferm of 3s. (per annum) . In King Edward's time it was worth 8s.\"1 I have already said who Fulcuius was,3 if indeed this Domesday Lord was identical with Fulcoius Vicecomes, who was living at least 35 years after Domesday. We have seen that Fulcoius Vicecomes had a son Henry, living in the latter part of Henry I.'s reign. However it is clear that from eventual failure of heirs, or some other cause, the two Domesday estates of Fulcuius escheated to the Crown, and that the Seigneury over both (with a slight reservation in one) was afterwards bestowed on Fitz Alan. It is further ap parent, as regards half Little Withiford, that Fitz Alan's tenant there was that Hamo le Strange, who, as we have seen under Childs Ercall, died in the first six years of Henry II.'s reign, without legiti mate issue. Whether the estate under notice then reverted to Fitz 1 Domesday, so. 259, a, 2. 2 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 304."], [527, "73 LITTLE WITHIFORD. Alan, as Seigneural Lord, I cannot say, but Fitz Aer became Fitz Alan's Tenant thereof, nor do I find any sure indication that Hamo le Strange's heirs ever stood mediate between Fitz Alan and Fitz Aer in the tenure of Little Withiford. At Great Withiford how ever, where Fitz Aer was also Tenant-in-fee, he held under Le Strange of Knokyn, who held under Fitz Alan. This would hardly establish the probability of a parallel scale of tenure in the case of Little Withiford, for we do not know that Hamo le Strange was ever Lord of Great Withiford ; consequently we do not know that his right heirs, the Stranges of Knokyn, derived their mesne interest in Great Withiford from him. I take it that Reginald de Rughelton or de Rowelton, who in 1221 was Tenant in fee-simple of this estate, held it under Fitz Aer. That however did not transpire in the proceedings which I am about to detail. \u2014 At the Assizes of November 1221, Reginald de Rughelton was sued for 2 virgates (equivalent to the Domesday half-hide) in Little Withiford, by Stephen Walsh (Wallensis). The said Stephen claimed as Nephew and heir of Hamo le Strange, and under writ of mort d'ancestre. The formal questions were whether Hamo Extraneus the Plaintiff's Uncle (avunculus) had died, seized in demesne of the said two virgates, and whether Stephen was his heir. The first issue was decided by the Jury in the affirmative, but there was a technical flaw, fatal to a suit of mort d'ancestre. It was that Hamo le Strange had died three reigns previously, viz. in the time of \" Henry father of King Richard.\" The Plaintiff of course took nothing and was pronounced in misei'icordid for a false claim.1 It is much to be regretted by the genealogical inquirer that the Jury were not obliged to come to any finding on the question of Stephen Walsh's heirship to Hamo le Strange ; for though I am well satisfied that he was not his heir, I should rejoice to know how he was related to him. . It would seem that Stephen Walsh renewed his action in some other form. A suit concerning 2 virgates in Parva Wicford was pending at Westminster in Michaelmas Term 1223, the Plaintiff and Defendant being described as Stephen le Waleis and Reginald fitz Reginald. A Fine levied on October 13, 1224, shows that the new form of procedure hada been by grand assize. The result was that Stephen Walsh (Plaintiff), acknowledged the right of Reginald de Reuulton 1 Assizes, 6 Hen. III., m. 4. viii. 10"], [528, "74 LITTLE WITHIFORD. (tenant) to two virgates in Parva Wyford : but Reginald and his heirs were to hold under Stephen and his heirs at a rent of 3s., and were to discharge all dues to the Chief-Lords of the Fee. Reginald further paid 100s. down for this concession. It is evident therefore that Stephen Walsh's claim to the tenancy was a substantial one. The Pipe-Roll of 1225 records how Stephen Walensis owed one merk to the Crown for license to accord with Reginald de Wiford. At the Assizes of August 1226 Reginald de Parva Wideford appears in a new cause, and this time as Plaintiff. He got damages of 6s. against Siward de Wydeford for disseizing him of a tenement in Wydeford. By a Fine of May 18, 1242, Reginald de Wythiford, Plaintiff, renounces all right to take estovers in GUes de Erdinton's wood of Hemmesle, and all right of pesson for the swine of Regi nald himself, or his men of Wythiford. For this quitclaim Er dinton paid 10 merks. In 1256 I find Reginald de Withiford sitting on an Uppington Jury. Before 1267 the person whom we may describe as Reginald fitz Reginald de Rowlton or de Parva Withiford, was deceased, leaving two sons and a daughter. Reginald, apparently the younger son, was sued in August of that year by Sibil, the daughter, for disseizing her of a messuage and half-virgate in Withiford. Regi nald pleaded that his Father, while living, had handed over the pre mises to himself, during pleasure, and for a sum of money, and that on his Father's death he entered the premises, so that Sibil had never been seized thereof. Sibil on the other hand affirmed herself to have been in seizin for half a year after her Father's death. This the Jury affirmed : and Reginald was amerced one merk for disseizin and had to pay 36s. damages. A Fine of April 7, 1269, introduces another son, I think the heir, of Reginald de Wythiford. WiUiam fitz Reginald de Wythiford was Plaintiff, and Reginald de Wythiford (his brother I presume) was Defendant in a suit of warranty concerning one virgate in Parva Wythiford. Reginald (by his Attorney, Roger de Preston) re nounced his claim, and WUliam in return conceded the premises to Reginald; \u2014 to hold for life, at a rent of lc?. payable to WiUiam, and by performance of all capital services due from William and his heirs. Reginald was bound not to alienate the premises : they were to revert to WiUiam and his heirs. A mutilated indorsement of this Fine gives another son or perhaps daughter, of Reginald fitz Reginald de Wythiford as opposing his or her claim. The Feodary of 1284 describes the Manor under notice as half"], [529, "WITHIN GTON. 75 the vill of Parva Wythinton, and adds that John fitz Aer held it of Richard fitz Alan, who held it in capite. The Bradford Tenure- Roll is nearly cotemporary and more explicit. It states that William fitz Reginald held half Parva Whetheford under John fitz Aer, who held of Richard fitz Alan, who held in capite. The Inquisition, taken 12 February, 1293, on the death of John fitz Aer, contains a puzzling statement. It says that the deceased had held 5s. rent in Parva Wythyford of the Fee of Robert de Halcheton. A similar thing is stated in the Inquest taken in De cember 1313, on the death of Hugh fitz Aer.\u2014 \"The deceased had held 5s. rent in Parva Wythyford under Thomas de Halghton (then in ward to the King), and he had held it by service of receiving the homage and service of a certain WiUiam Reynald.\" This is tantamount to saying that Hugh fitz Aer was mesne-lord of a part of Little Withiford, holding under De Haughton and over William fitz Reginald. Singularly enough we have another and earlier in dication that the Haughtons had an interest in Little Withiford.1 I think however that in both instances there has been some confu sion between Little Withiford and Withington, the latter of which was undoubtedly held by De Haughton. And as to Thomas de Haughton's being in ward to the Crown so late as December 1313, that I am nearly sure is inaccurate. \u0153ttjjmatm This Manor is so associated with Little Withiford that I will not separate them. Domesday says as follows. \u2014 \" Fulcuius holds Wientone of Earl Roger. Uluuin and Uluric held it (in Saxon times) for two Manors. Here are two hides and a half. The (arable) land is (enough) for mi ox-teams. In demesne there are n ox-teams, and mi Serfs and i Female Serf; and (there are) in Villains and i Boor with a team and half. In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 15s. (per annum). Now it is worth 21s. He (Fulcuius) found it waste.\"3 The fact that Fulcuius left no permanent successors and that his estates escheated to the Crown is made clear in the case of Withing ton \u2022 for though the Seigneury of half the Manor was annexed to Vide Testa de Nevill, pp. 47, 49. | 2 Domesday, so. 259, a, 2."], [530, "76 WITHIN GTON. the Fief of Fitz Alan, the other half was made a Serjeantry, and the occupant thereof owed his service immediately to the King. But though the Seigneury of the Manor became thus divided, it hap pened that one Tenant held each moiety. The King's Tenants and Fitz Alan's Tenants were those Haughtons, whose possessions and history I have briefly sketched under Cleobury North.1 Roger fitz Henry, the earliest known representative of the family, occurs from 1165 to 1190. Before the year 1172 he made the following grant to Haughmond Abbey, which supplies us with the names of his wife and brother. \u2014 Notuin sit omnibus tarn presen tibus quam futuris me Rogerum filium Henrici et uxorem meam Leti ciam et meos heredes concessisse et donasse Deo et Ecclesie Sancti Johannis Evangeliste de Haghmon molendinum Withentunie, cum xi acris et duobus pratis et cum omnibus perlinenciis suis, in perpetuam elemosynam, et quondam piscariam que ad predict am villam pertinet, ita libere et quiete sicut prescriptum est de molendino, pro animd patris mei et pro animd Philippi fratris mei et, pro animd matris et uxoris mee et pro animabus omnium parentum nostrorum et benefac torum. Hiis testibus, Siivart Presbitro, Edrico clerico? Pope Alexander's Confirmation of 1172 describes the above grant as that of Roger fitz Henry, and as consisting of the Mill of Within ton and a Fishery on the Tern. It also confirms a meadow under the Mill of Withenton which the Canons had acquired by purchase. It appears from the Pipe-Roll of 1182 that Roger fitz Henry, though he had now been at least 17 years in possession of his estates, had hitherto escaped paying the Relief due to the Crown on the succession of a Tenant by Serjeantry. He is accordingly charged 40s. \" for his Relief and for concealing the same.\" He paid the charge in this and the following year. He must have died about March 1190, for at Michaelmas 1190, Ralph Archdeacon of Here ford, as Escheator for Shropshire, renders account of 8s. arising from Widinton, a recent escheat of half a year's standing. The Eschea tors for the years ending Michaelmas 1192 and Michaelmas 1193 render similar account of 16s. arising in each year, viz. \"for the rent of Witinton which was Roger fitz Henry's, whose land is in the King's hand together with the heir.\" The said heir came of age soon afterwards; for among the Nova Oblata proffered on King Richard's return from Captivity, and registered in the Pipe-Roll of 1194 is this one. \u2014 Tomas filius Rogeri reddit compotum de v marcis pro habendo redditu ] 6 solidorum et 1 nisi per annum de Supra, Vol. III. pp. 25-28. | 2 Haughmond Chartulary, so. 221."], [531, "77 WITHINGTON. terra de Widiton, quam tenet de Rege in capite per serjanteriam in veniendi unum militem ad conducendos Walenses de Powis ad Curiam Regis. In thesauro liberavit. Et quietus est. Hence it would appear that the moiety of Withington which Thomas fitz Roger held of the King was underlet for rents of 16s. and a hawk. His Serjeantry was to provide a knight who should conduct the Welshmen of Powis-land whenever they had to visit the English Court. The great feudal position which, as I shall show elsewhere, the Haughtons sometime occupied on the Shropshire Border, ren dered such a service appropriate. In Easter Term 1201 I find Thomas fitz Roger on a jury of Staf fordshire Knights. In the same Term William fitz Robert and Robert Scitte of Salop had each a Suit concerning lands against Thomas fitz Roger. The latter is in one instance called Thomas de Halton. Richard le Parmunter, Alan fitz Berenger, Reginald Nich of Salop, Richard Saddoc and Richard de St. Edmund, appeared as Essoignors of the two Plaintiffs. In 1204, like other Tenants by Serjeantry, Thomas fitz Roger was assessed to the fifth Scutage of King John. He seems to have compounded for the same by pay ment of one merk. In 1211 we have a RoU of Shropshire Serjeantries with the fol lowing entry. \u2014 \"Thomas filius Rogeri debet de servitio invenire unum servientem peditem ad conducendos WaUenses de Powis ad custum domini Regis.\"1 Here for the word custum I should pro pose to read Curiam. The Testing clause of a Deed in the Salop Chartulary exhibits Thomas de Halechton as Constable of Shrews bury Castle, but I find no other proof of his having held that office. I have said under Cleobury North that he was deceased in 1240. He must have died long before, for in the summer of 1226 Robert de Halechton (his son) appears as Lord of the Staf fordshire Manor of Hull and as unjustly withholding the same from Robert son of Philip Noel, his rightful tenant.3 In the Pipe- RoU of 1227 Robert de Halton is named as though he had held some Escheatorship or Bailiwick in Shropshire.\u2014 He owed 7s., the value of the chattels of some outlaw. Patents of September 1235 and June 1237 name Robert de Haleghton and others as Justices to try causes of novel disseizin. Another Patent of October 1237 names him and some of his former colleagues as Justices to deliver the Gaols of Brug and Shrewsbury. 1 Testa de Nevill, p. 55. I i Abbrev. Placitorum, p. 103."], [532, "78 WITHINGTON. The Feodary of 1240 gives Robert de Haletton as holding Jth of a knight's-fee in Withinton, Knitteleg, and Parva-Wytheford, of the Barony of Fitz Alan.1 His tenure of half Withington and of Knightley (Staffordshire) under Fitz Alan is confirmed by numer ous documents ; but whether he had any mesne interest in Little Withiford is a question which I have already discussed. In January 1254 Robert de Halecton would appear to have accompanied his Suzerain, Fitz Alan, on foreign service. A Patent dated on the same day (January 28) as that granted to Fitz Alan, allows that Robert de Halecton shall not be put on any Assize, nor serve as Co roner, Escheator, Forester or Verderer against his wiU.3 In March 1255 he was appointed Receiver of aU moneys arising from the sale of timber in the King's Forests of Shropshire, Staffordshire, and Worcestershire. The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 says nothing about Little Withiford, but treats of Withington very explicitly. \u2014 \" Robert de Halhton holds the vill of Wythynton, half of John fitz Alan, and half of the King, in capite, by service of conducting the Welsh to conferences (parliamenta) from Shrewsbury Castle to Moneford Bridge. The Manor is m hides, geldable, and pays 10c?. per annum for motfee, and 10c?. for stretward, and does due suit to County and Hundred.\"3 It is probable, that Robert de Haughton's charge was to provide safe-conduct for Welsh embassies between Montford -bridge and Shrewsbury, whether going to or returning from the English Court. The above estimate of three hides is, I should observe, inconsis tent with the payment of 10c?. for stretward and lOd. for motfee. The latter would indicate a Manor of 2\\ hides, the exact counter part of the Domesday Withington. Of Sir John de Haughton, Robert's supposed successor, I find no notice in connection with Withington. I am very doubtful about the succession of the famUy at this period, and whether Agnes, who occurs with her son Thomas in 1282, was really widow of Sir John. I must leave the evidence as I find it : but that part of if which has been given under Cleobury North is inconsistent with the apparent fact that a Robert de Haughton was Lord of With ington in 1267. In September of that year I find that a Writ was taken out by Thomas de Wythinton against Robert de Haston for disseizing the said Thomas of common-pasture in Wythinton.* Again, a Patent of January 10, 1269, appoints Robert de Halwton 1 Testa de Nevill, pp. 47, 49. 2 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 254. 3 Rot. Hundred. II. 57. 4 Rot. Finium, II. 518."], [533, "79 WITHINGTON. as a Justice to deliver the Gaol of Brug. Lastly Agnes de Halin ton, a Staffordshire Lady, who in July 1270 fines half a merk for a Writ of Pone, was widow of Robert de Halinton, not of Sir John, as the account given under Cleobury North shows me to haVe once supposed. That Thomas de Haughton, the next known successor to Withington, was married in or before 1264 and died in 1282, we are quite sure. Also when we find that his mother's name was Agnes I cannot doubt that his Father was Robert. How John and Robert were related I cannot say, nor have I more than the single Deed quoted under Cleobury North1 to show that one John was head of this famUy about 1260-3. Thomas de Haughton (II. ), as he may be called, was deceased before Nov. 25, 1282, when the Writ of Diem clausit announces the fact. The Shropshire Inquest, taken on February 1, 1283, says that the deceased had held nothing in capite in that county : and indeed it appears that the Withington Serjeantry was ere this ex tinct, and that the whole Manor was held under Fitz Alan. The service due thereon was half a knight's-fee, viz. to provide one Esquire with a barbed horse &c, at Oswestry for 40 days. Agnes mother of the deceased held part of the vill in dower. Cleobury North, already noticed, and Longner, to be noticed hereafter, were also Manors held by the deceased. In Staffordshire he had held Offley and Schelbeden under the Lord Stafford, for a knight's-fee. Knightley (which he held under Fitz Alan) was held under him by Sir Robert de Knightley for one-fourth of a fee. He, conversely, had held the hamlet of HuUe under Sir Robert de Knightley at a rent of 5s. He had also held Tunstal and La Lee under the Bishop of Chester for one-fourth of a fee.3 Robert de Haughton, son and heir of Thomas, though not 18 years of age at his Father's death, appears in the Feodaries of 1284-5 as holding Withington for half a knight's-fee under Richard fitz Alan. At the Assizes of 1292 under the head De Valettis, Ro bert de Halenton was returned by the Bradford Jurors as holding a Knight's-fee, and as not a Knight. His exercise of Free Warren in Wythynton was also noticed. As Robert de Halghton and as holding \u00a320 of lands and rents, he was summoned from the County of Salop to perform military service in parts' beyond the seas ; and to attend muster at London on July 7, 1297. On January 14, 1300, he was one of the Commissioners appointed to summon the knights of Shropshire and Staffordshire for service against the 1 Supra, Vol. III. pp- 27, 28. | = Inquisitions, 11 Edw. I., No. 30."], [534, "80 WITHINGTON. Scots. On June 24, 1301, he was himself to be at Berwick-upon- Tweed for the same object.1 The Inquest held at Withington on his death, in 1304, I have already quoted.3 It states him to have held a messuage and half-virgate there, under the heir of Richard fitz Alan, by service of two appearances yearly at the Court of Up ton (Magna). It further states that he held 4 carucates in the same viU, under Philip Nugent, in whose behalf he was bound to do monthly suit at Salop County-Court, and suit every three weeks to Bradford Hundred. This mesne-interest of Philip Nugent I cannot reconcile with what has transpired above as to the tenure of Withington : and yet it wiU be shown under Uckington that, a cen tury earlier, a previous Philip Nugent had interests in this quarter. Robert de Haughton's Fief in the Barony of Stafford is stated to have been 2^ Fees in Haughton and Offley, and to have been worth _\u00a340 per annum. Thomas de Haughton (III.), son and heir of Robert, was 15 years of age on August 29, 1303. In the Nomina Villarum of 1316 he is entered as Lord of Whytinton and Cleo bury North ; and also of Maer and High Offley in Staffordshire. In 1322 the armorial bearings of Sir Thomas de Haluton were en tered on the Roll of the Battle of Boroughbridge, but the Re cord is indistinct. Between 1322 and 1325 he occurs frequently as a Commissioner of levies in Staffordshire ; and in 1325 he was ordered to attend the Earl Warren then setting out for Guienne.3 I now return to take some notice of the \u2014 Undertenants of Withington. At the Assizes of 1203 one Roger de Withenton appeared to essoign the attendance of Philip de Nugent. About 1234-6 Thomas de Haleton and Thomas de Withinton appear as consecutive witnesses of a grant to Haugh mond Abbey. The first was perhaps of Haughton, near Haugh mond.4 Henry de Withington occurs on an Uppington Inquest in 1246. I must quote very briefly some grants to Haughmond, but which I have no means of dating with certainty. \u2014 1. Thomas de Withinton gave to the Abbey all his part of the meadow of Benerei. Witness, Osbem Chaplain of Lega. 2. Alice de Withinton, his widow, quit-claimed her third of the same meadow. Witness, Thomas de Withenton her son. 3.

To return; \u2014 In Easter Term 1243 Robert de Whittenton had a suit against the Abbot of Lilleshall concerning estovers. Thomas de Withington has been named already as at issue with Robert de Haughton in 1267. He, or another of the same name, was first Juror on the Inquest of 1283, after the death of Thomas de Haugh ton. Thomas de Withington also occurs on Jury Lists or Testing clauses in 1277, 1283, 1285, 1290, and 1292. I have already said something of him under Pimley.1 On the whole, an important per son of this name may be said to occur from 1267 till 1318. One Walter de Wythynton occurs on a Jury List in 1290. On February 9, 1307, Nicholas le Bonde of Tyrne and Agnes his wife (Plaintiffs) quitclaim to Richard son of Richard de Wythinton (Tenant) a messuage and half-virgate (less 6 acres) in Wythington, whereof was suit-at-law. For this the Plaintiffs had 10 merks. Haughmond Abbey Fee. I have two notes of the Abbey's con tinued interest in Withington. On August 2, 1340, Peter Cort of Withinton releases to the Abbey all right in a meadow called Hertesbilet. Witness, John de Clone. On May 3, 1477, the Abbot demises to WiUiam Onnyslowe of Rodington, Gentleman, and Marione his wife, and the heirs of their bodies, the Mill of Withinton, called Liemulle, for ninety-nine years, at a rent of 12s. Withington Church. This has been already identified as a Chapel of Upton Magna,3 but as existent at least as early as the time of Bishop Durdent (1148-1159). The Advowson of course belonged to Shrewsbury Abbey, but the Records which I usually quote in respect of Parish Churches are altogether silent about the Chapel of Withington. Cljettopntr* I have given under Willey a full account of the Fief held by Turold de Verley*at Domesday, and have stated that the Seigneury of most > Supra, Vol. VII. pp. 307, 308. | 2 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 264. 11 VIII. l"], [536, "82 CHETWYND. of his Manors passed to Fitz Alan. Turold had six Manors in Re cordine Hundred. Chetwynd is described in Domesday as follows. \u2014 \"The same Turold hold Catewinde (of the Earl). The Countess Godeva held it (in Saxon times).

He (Turold) found it waste.\"1 This Manor became the caput of what was ordinarily known as the Fee of Chetwynd, a term which included ten out of the thirteen Domesday Manors of Turold. The said ten Manors were all held under Fitz Alan by the family of Chetwynd, but in some of them the Chetwynds had their Undertenants or Feoffees. It is uncertain at what period this augmentation of Fitz Alan's Barony took place. It was later than the compilation of 1165, known as the Liber Niger .- for no Feoffee in that Record can be identified with the Lord of Chetwynd, whose military service to Fitz Alan was the service of two knights'-fees. I take it then that the Lord of Chet wynd, at the time of the Liber Niger, was a Tenant in capite, whose return is not preserved. His fealty and service was probably be stowed on the second William fitz Alan by Henry II. or Richard I. Adam de Chetwynd, the first Lord of Chetwynd whom I can discover, occurs on the Forest-RoU of 1180 as compounding for a pourpresture by payment of 3s. In June 1200 he occurs as Visor in a case of Essoign, a business always at that time entrusted to knights. At the County Assizes of October 1203, Adam de Chet wind essoigned his attendance at the common summons, his Essoign or being Nicholas Crasset. John de Chetwynd, son of Adam, probably succeeded his father before 1210. We have had a hint to that effect,3 but at the same time it is certain that he attested Charters as early as 1202-3, and so in his father's lifetime. At all events he appears among the Knights of Shropshire at the Assizes of November 1221, but his only concern was as a Juror in causes of Grand jlssize. At the As sizes of 1226 one WiUiam fitz Robert sued John de Chetwynd for disseizing him of a free tenement in Chetwynd, viz. half a virgate which Adam de Chetwynd, father of John, had given to Robert fitz Wonram, father of the Plaintiff, to hold in fee and inheritance at a rent 1 Domesday, so. 257, b, 2. | 2 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 375."], [537, "83 CHETWYND. of 26c?. per annum. John de Chetwynd allowed his Father's Charter, but showed, that the Plaintiff's father had been a Villain and had been redeemed from Serfdom by Adam de Chetwynd, but that the Plain tiff had been born before such redemption. On this the Plaintiff withdrew his suit, but being poor was excused amercement, and was presented with 3 merks by John de Chetwynd, who further allowed him complete manumission (ibit quocunque voluerit) and acquitted him of aU serfdom (servitude). Of course the Plaintiff lost the land.1 The Feodaries of 1240 agree in representing Johnde Chete wind as holding Chetewind and its appurtenances, for two knights' fees in the Barony of Fitz Alan.3 In 1250 John de Chetewinde was amerced 5 merks by Geoffrey de Langley for venison-trespass, but the King excused him by special writ. A Patent of August 22, 1251, exempts John de Chetewind from liability to serve on Assizes, Juries, &c. A Charter dated at Windsor on Nov. 3, 1252, gives John de Chetwynd Free Warren on his lands in Shropshire, Stafford shire, and Warwickshire. Chetwynd, Weston, and Howie are the estates particularized.3 Another Patent of 1253 includes him among those, whose estates were entitled to protection and immunity so long as the owners should be serving the King in Gascony. The Bradford Hundred-RoU of 1255 says as follows. \u2014 \"The Manor of Chetewynde is of the Barony of Sir John fitz Alan of Whiteminster (Oswestry) . And it is ix geldable hides, and one whole knight's-fee. And it pays 3s. per annum for motfee and 3s. for stretward, and makes due suit to County and Hundred. And John de Chetewinde holds the said Manor in capite of the said John fitz Alan. And the said John de Chetewinde shaU provide three Mountores at his own cost at White-minster.\"4 The different estimates which we are constantly meeting with of the military service due on a particular tenure are perhaps to be reconciled. I take it that when John de Chetwynd is said to hold under Fitz Alan by service of one knight, it is forinsec service that is alluded to, \u2014 the exact service which he as a knight had rendered in 1253 when he accompanied Fitz Alan to Gascony. When again his service is described as two knights'-fees I conclude that he was as sessable in that proportion to the scutages and aids charged on his Suzerain. Lastly the service of 3 Mountores, equivalent to 1^ fees, was a different thing, not necessarily bearing any proportion to the other kinds of liability. It was the amount of Castle-guard service, 3 Rot. Cart. 37 Hen. III., m. 8. 4 Rot. Hundred. II. 57. 1 Abbrev.

The above extract from the Hundred-Roll requires explanation on another point. When Chetwynd is said to be a Manor of nine hides, it is taken to include at least the following Domesday Manors, viz. Chetwynd proper \u2014 3 hides, Pilson \u2014 1 hide, Sambrook \u2014 1\\ hides, Howie \u2014 2 hides, and Bearstone \u2014 1 hide. How the remain ing half-hide was supplied I cannot say. John de Chetwynd's appearance at the Assizes of 1256 as Mesne- Lord of Willey has already been noticed.1 On the same occasion he impleaded James de Audley, Adam Provost of Edgemond, and many others, for disseizing him of 100 acres of heath in Chetwynd. The question was one of boundary. Audley denied that the pre mises were in Chetwynd, and maintained that even if they were, he had not disseized the Plaintiff, for his own Father, Henry de Audley, had died seized of the premises as appurtenant to bis Manor of Edgemond.3 I suppose that about this time there was a change in this suc cession, and that one John de Chetwynd was succeeded by a son and heir of the same name. At all events we may safely conclude that it was \u2014 John de Chetwynd (II.) who in April 1263 was serving with John fitz Alan in Wales.3 About the same time I find Sir John and Sir Philip de Chetwynd attesting a Charter of Robert Earl Ferrers. The eventual son and heir of John de Chetwynd was, as we shall see, born about 1264-5, \u2014 another proof that the John of that date was a young man. It was this Sir John de Chetwynd who, with Philip de Chetwynd and others, was commissioned to de liver the Gaol of Brug in July 1269, and whom we have seen attest ing a LilleshaU Charter about 1272-7,4 and who is followed by Sir Philip his Brother in a Staffordshire Deed of the same period.5 I should here say a word about a matter which has been stated with some inaccuracy by other authors. \u2014 Sir Philip de Chetwynd, though a younger son, had acquired a great property in Staffordshire by marrying Isabella the heiress of the Muttons. He was in fact ancestor of the Chetwynds of Inges tre, Gratwich, and Mutton, now represented by the Earl of Shrews bury. The following dates may be of use. Ralph de Mutton, whose 1 Supra, Vol. II. p. 57. 4 Supra, Vol. III. p. 19, note 39. 5 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 393. 2 Assizes, 40 Hen.

Philip de Chetwynd, Isabella's husband, was deceased in 1285, and Isabella herself died in 1291, when on March 1, the King as Guardian of the young Lord Stafford, accepted the fealty of Philip her son and heir. But there was another cotemporary of Sir John and Sir Philip de Chetwynd, possibly their brother, whom I must now notice. This was \u2014 Adam de Chetwynd, of whom I have some memoranda con veying the idea that he was a very wealthy man. At the Assizes of October 1272, Robert de Munford (Lord of IdsaU, I presume) acknowledged before the Justices, a debt of 50 merks to Adam de Chetewynd. Thomas Corbet of Tasley acknowledged a debt of 100s., and Ralph le Bolyter (of Wem) a debt of _\u00a310. 8s. to the same. Bolyter's securities were Peter de Eyton, Thomas de EUerton, Robert de Helshaw, Elyas de Stoke, and Robert de Ford. Adam de Chetwynd was also Creditor of Thomas Botterel in one merk, of John de Lee in one merk, of John de Erkalu in 36s., and of Robert de Staunton in 18s. In March 1274 I find Adam de Chetewinde acting as the King's Escheator in Cheshire aud North Shropshire. On October 24, 1275, King Edward appoints Adam de Chete winde to assess the current tax of the Fifteenth in Gloucestershire. On the Pipe-Roll of 1278 Adam de Chetwind is charged 100 merks which he had received three years before from Reginald de Grey ; \u2014probably in trust for the King. A Writ of March 12, 1279, ap points Adam de Chetwynd a Commissioner to inquire into the conduct of the Sheriff of Shropshire and Staffordshire in distrain ing persons to take the degree of Knighthood, and, in case the Sheriff had been negligent, to enforce the King's orders on the sub ject with strictness. John de Chetwynd (II.) to whom I now recur, is stated by Dugdale to have had a grant of rents in Baxterley (Warwickshire) from his kinsman, John son of William Lovel. Dugdale places this early in Edward I.'s reign, and with great probability, for John de Chetwynd was deceased before February 13, 1281. There were several Inquests on his death. The first was held pursuant to a Writ of Diem clausit dated Feb. 13, 1281, which Writ shows that the King's interference arose as having the wardship of John de Chetwynd's Suzerain, young Richard fitz Alan. The Shropshire Inquest states that the deceased had held Chetwind and its appur tenances for 2 knights'-fees, of the Barony of Fitz Alan. Barkis-"], [540, "86 CHETWYND. ford, Conishill, Stockton, and Howie are considered members of Chetwynd. There was a Park here. The Advowson of the Church was valued at 20s., the Incumbency at 20 merks per annum. The whole of Chetwynd, thus extended, was estimated to yield the goodly sum of \u00a332 per annum to its Lord. The Staffordshire Inquest states John de Chetwind to have held the Manor of Weston, by service of one lesser fee of Morteyn, under Robert de Staundon, who held under the Barons Stafford. A War wickshire Inquest states him to have held certain rents in Baxter ley, under Richard de Harcourt, by service of lib. of pepper.1 This Inquest, taken in July 1281, states Philip to be son and heir of John de Chetwind and to be 18 years of age. All the other In quests make Reginald to be the name of the heir and agree in stat ing him to be 16 years of age, but vary as to his birthday having been Oct. 9, 1264, or Feb. 22, 1265.3 Before I discuss these discrepancies I will notice some other do cuments, which, although they somewhat encumber the narration, are of intrinsic importance. \u2014 On December 28, 1282, King Edward I., then at Rhuddlan, had received a complaint from Eva de Oswaldestre to the effect that she, having had custody of certain Manors by gift of Adam de Chete wynde, had been deprived thereof upon Adam's death, the Manors having been seized into the King's hand. The King now orders the Sheriff of Salop and Staffordshire to inquire into this matter, and meantime to keep custody of the Manors, allowing Eva a com petent sustenance out of the proceeds thereof. An Inquest held at Stafford on January 9, 1283, found that by gift of Adam de Chet wynd and long before his death, Eva had had custody of the Manors of Tixhall, Ypstanes, Weston, and Chetwynd, and that, since Adam's death, Eva had retained the said custody, till the Sheriff had seized it for the Crown. Similarly it was found that the Sheriff had con fiscated the Manor of Hartwell, of which John son of Adam de Chetwynd had been seized from the day on which he had been en feoffed thereof by John fitz Philip, till the day of the said seizure by the Sheriff.3 Now we have seen Adam de Chetewinde attesting a Deed of John fitz Philip of Bobbington, which I ventured to date between 1270 and 1280.4 The feoffment of Adam de Chetwynd's son must belong to the same interval. But what is more to our present pur- 1 Dugdale's Warwickshire, p. 1054. 2 Inquisitions, 9 Edw. I., No. 6. 3 Inquisitions, 11 Edw. I., No. 80. 4 Supra, Vol. III. p. 170, note 55."], [541, "87 CHETWYND. pose is the apparent certainty that, on John de Chetwynd's death in 1281, Adam de Chetwynd must have obtained custody of his estates, viz. Chetwynd and Weston-juxta-Standon. As to Tixall and Ipstones they too were probably acquired by purchase of some other wardship. Adam de Chetwynd at once conveys these acqui sitions to Eva de Oswaldistre, but dying within two years, the Sheriff seizes upon the estate of his son and the wardships of his Assignee, as though he had been a Tenant in capite, and had died seized of the whole. A Writ of January 16, 1283, orders that restitution be made to Eva de Oswaldestre,1 and that Adam de Chetwynd's credits and debts with the Crown should be put in a proper course of settle ment. I now pass to the Feodaries of 1284-5, because they exhibit the three branches of Chetwynds much in the position which the fore going arguments would lead us to expect. At this time \u2014 John son of Adam de Chetwynd was Mesne Lord of Hilderston (Staffordshire), that is, he was in possession of an estate, though not the particular estate before noticed. Again \u2014 Philip de Chetwynd was Lord of Mutton and Ingestre, and Mesne-lord of Salt, all in Staffordshire. Lastly \u2014 Reginald de Chetwynd was Lord of Weston- juxta-Standon in Staffordshire, and of Chetwynd in Shropshire. The latter Manor is noticed as follows. \u2014 \" Reginald de Chetwind holds the Manor of Chetwind with its members, viz. Stocton, Pyne- lesdon, Ethelarton (Ellerton), Sambrok, Bardeston, Howeleye (Howie), and half the vill of Pykesleye (Pixley), under Richard fitz Alan, by service of two knights'-fees; and he (Fitz Alan) holds of the King, in capite, and the Manor is geldable.\"2 1 It is a curious question who this Eva de Oswaldestre may have been. Perhaps the following is a clue to the mystery. \u2014 The Fitz-Warin Chronicle tells us of an Eva fitz Warin who after the death of Joan, Princess of North Wales, became second wife of Lhewelyn ap Jorweth. Af ter Lhewelyn's death (which we know to have happened in April 1240), Eva, who had only been his wife a year and a half, remarried. Her second husband, says the Chronicle, was the \" Sire de Blanc Mos tiers,\" a knight of great breeding, coura geous and bold. de Blancminster to have been one person, we conclude her to have been in her se cond widowhood in 1282. The difficulty, which remains, is, \u2014 to identify her second husband, the \" Sire de Blanc Mostiers.\" We should expect to find some head of the house of Fitz Alan leaving a widow Eva between 1240 and 1282, but we know from evidence already given (Vol. VII. p. 228) that such was not the case. 2 Bradford Tenure-Boll (penes mei), compared with Kirbey's Quest. The former document writes the names Begi naldus and Bogerus without any distinc tion except the hardly perceptible one Supposing Eva de Oswaldistre and Eva"], [542, "88 CHETWYND. After this we suddenly and unaccountably find a third John de Chetwynd as Lord of Chetwynd. John de Chetwynd (III.) was presented by the Bradford Jurors at the Assizes of October 1292, as claiming rights of Free- Warren in Chetwynd. An Inquest, taken in 1293, states that a quarter of a fee in Baxterley was held of Richard de Harcourt, deceased, by the heir of John de Chetwind, a proof I think that John de Chetwynd (III.) had not long been in possession. Again, an Inquest of the year 1300, already quoted, names John de Chetwynd as then Mesne-Lord of Evelith. On June 30, 1314, John de Chetwinde was included in a military summons against the Scots. In the Nomina Villarum of March 1316, he is returned as Lord of Chete wind. On June 27, 1318, Sir John de Chetewynde, Knight, pre sented Reginald de Chetwynde, an Acolyte, to Chetwynde Church. On July 17, 1318, John de Chetwind obtained the King's Charter empowering him to hold a weekly Market, on Tuesdays, at Chet wind, and a yearly Fair on the vigil, day, and morrow of All Saints (Oct. 31, Nov. 1 and 2) 7 The Arms of Sir John Chede wynt appear on the Roll of the Battle of Boroughbridge (March 1322). They were Azure, a Chevron between three Mullets or. I suppose that he was on the Rebel side. Nevertheless he attests a Deed at Shrewsbury on April 25th following2 and he was sum moned to attend a general Council to be holden at Westminster on May 30, 1324. In that and the two following years several Writs were addressed to him as a Commissioner of array in Cheshire, Shropshire, and Staffordshire.3 On January 3, 1326, the Bishop of Lichfield gives license of non-residence till August 1, to Regi nald de Chetwynd, Rector of Chetwynd, that he might be in per sonal attendance on Sir John de Chetwynd. On March 1, 1326, we have seen that Sir John de Chetewinde was at Clun in company with his Suzerain, Edmund Earl of Arundel.*4 I may conclude this part of my subject with stating that John de Chetwynd (III.) was living in 1351, but that his eldest son, Re ginald, was deceased seven years previously. The said Reginald left an only daughter, Joan. This Lady took the great inheritance of the Chetwynds to her husband Richard son of Adam de Peshale, between the second letters of each name. Hence I have inadvertently read the name as Roger in one instance (Vol. II. p. 307). Bardeston is named as a member of Chet wind, only in Kirbey's Quest. It is Bear stone, a place at the North-Eastern extre- mity of Shropshire. It was held by Turold at Domesday. Supra, Vol. II. p. 308. 1 Rot. Cart. 12 Edw.

The Lady Joan must have lived to a great age, and after Sir Richard Peshale's death she was twice if not thrice remarried. There may be a doubt whether William Slepe, who occurs in 1397-8, with some appearance of being Joan's husband, was really so : but certainly she was the wife of Robert de Heywode in 1404 and of Robert Tiptost in 1409-10. Of Undertenants in Chetwynd proper, I shall only name Thomas fitz Eustace of Chetwynd who occurs on a local Jury in 1283. CHETWYND CHUECH. This Church existed at Domesday, if we may take the mention of a resident Priest, in that Record, as an indication of such a fact. Its proximity to the now important Church of Newport, the Caput of a Deanery, is no disproof of the greater antiquity of Chetwynd Church, for Newport was non-existent at Domesday. We have seen Chetwynd Church valued by a Jury in 1281 at 20 merks (\u00a313. 6s. 8c*?.) per annum. The Taxation of 1291 lowers it to \u00a34. 13s. 4d., placing it in the Deanery of Newport (Novum Bur gum)? In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth rightly quoted the Church-Taxation of Chetewynd as 7 merks. They deducted from this tw-o merks, being the average value of the glebe and hay-tithes; \u2014 things which were not computable in ascertaining the value of the wheat, wool and lamb of the Parish. The latter were accordingly rated at 5 merks.2 The Valor of 1534-5 gives the preferment of Ralph Grene, Rec tor of Chetwynd, as \u00a31 1 per annum, less 3s. 10c?. for Synodals and Procurations.3 EABLY INCUMBENTS. William, Parson of Chetwynd, occurs in October 1272. Petro nilla widow of Robert Day had a writ de ingressu against him, but failed to prosecute. The same Incumbent appears as W.

John Sheynton, as he is afterwards called, exchanges on Sept. 19, 1393, with\u2014 William Cowper, Priest, late Rector of Moxley, who is pre sented to Chetwynd by Johanna, Relict of Richard Pesshale, knight. On August 3, 1401, Cowper exchanged preferments with \u2014 Richard Walleford, late Vicar of the Prebendal Church of Eccleshall. This Rector would seem to be identical with \u2014 Sir Richard Gardeyn, Rector of Chetwynd, who has a license of non-residence on Feb. 1, 1403. Walleford died in 1404, when on August 20, \u2014 Sir William fitz John, Chaplain, was presented by Robert Heywode, entitled Domicellus. I shall now notice such members of Chetwynd as may be taken to have been constituents of the Domesday Manor. Other vills, though reputed in later times to be members of Chetwynd, were distinct Manors in Domesday and must so be treated. Stockton, though now associated manorially with Woodcote, and though in the Parish of Longford, was once a member of Chetwynd. In 1201 there was an Agnes de Stocton alleging herself to be sister of, and coheir with, Eva the heiress of Longford. Agnes' husband had perhaps been Chetwynd's Tenant here, but nothing in Stockton was disputed between the alleged Sisters. In 1281, 4\\ virgates in Stocton are enumerated among the adjuncts of Chetwynd, held in demesne by John de Chetwynd de ceased.

A curious letter or certificate is preserved in the Haughmond Chartulary from Geoffrey Griffin \" to his noble and most dear friend Simon de Walton, Jus ticiar of the King.\" He informs the said Simon how the Writer, being of sound mind, memory, and sense, had disposed of Howie to the two Abbeys aforesaid, for the health of his soul.

It would seem that the Canons of Haughmond forthwith sur rendered their moiety of Howie to John de Chetwind, already the Suzerain. There is a Deed in the Chartulary, which must have passed between 1250 and 1255, whereby John de Chetewinde binds himself and his heirs to pay a rent of 2s. to the Abbey for a moiety of Howie. He further covenants to acquit the Vill of Howie of the service of one Munitor and all other service which it owed in war time at John fitz Alan's Whiteminster,1 and of all tallages, scutages, &c, due to the King. The Abbey was to have homage and ward ship of Chetwynd's heirs, in respect of the said moiety, saving how ever all that was due of this kind to Sir John fitz Alan (the Lord Paramount) and his heirs. Chetwynd ratified the undertak ing with his seal and his corporal oath, in the presence of Robert de Grendon, then Sheriff; Sir William de Hedley, Sir Robert de Halechton (Haughton), and Robert Corbet (of Moreton.)2 The Inquest on the death of John de Chetwynd (II.) in 1281, estimates his tenement of Howie at 8 virgates and a Mill (exactly the Domesday contents of the Manor) ; it treats the Vill as a member of Chetwynd, but notifies with signal accuracy how the deceased had held half thereof under Haughmond Abbey, at a rent of 2s., the Abbot being further entitled to homage and wardship in respect of such estate. The other moiety was held by the deceased under LilleshaU Abbey, exactly for similar rent and conditions. These particulars were elicited by a special Writ of March 29, 1281, ordering the Sheriff to ascertain the nature of John de Chetwynd's tenure under the two Abbeys. The whole affair shows us how completely the Lord and Feoffee changed their feudal relations, when the former took a sub-feoffment under his previous Vassal. 1 Apud Album Monasterium Johannis fflii Alani; \u2014 the intention being to mark Oswestry as distinct from Whitchurch. 2 Haughmond Chartulary, so. 126."], [547, "93 iz>aml)rciok* \"The same Turold holds Semebre (of the Earl).

In 1262 Roger Waldyng was one of the Regarders of the Forest of Mount GUbert. His litigation in 1271-2 with Ralph le Botyler and WUliam de Titley has been noticed under Corselle.3 It was pro bably a question as to the boundary between Cross- HiU and Sam brook. About this time we have Roger Walding de Sambro' attest ing a Calvington Deed. He was one of the Jurors for Bradford Hundred at the Assizes of 1272. Again, Roger Waldyng occurs on a Woodcote Jury in 1278, a Withington Jury in 1283, and a Hodnet Jury in 1284. In December 1285 he is named again as a Regarder of the King's Forest. Henry de Sambrok, who occurs on a local Jury in 1281, was per haps of this place. Sambrook Chapel. Such a structure exists only in Tradition. It must have been immediately subject to the Church of Cheswar dine. Ellerton probably became a member of Chetwynd from having been originaUy a member of Sambrook. It is still associated paro chiaUy with Sambrook, for both are in the Parish of Cheswardine. De Chetwynd's Feoffees at Ellerton bore the name of the place. In 1191 and 1200 Adam de Alarton appears as a Recognizor in that Chesswell suit which I have noticed under Eyton.3 He was I think a knight, for in June 1200 he was one of four Visors sent to ascer tain whether the Abbot of LiUeshall's alleged illness was sufficient plea for an essoign in a cause then pending at Westminster.

In 1220 he was one of the Jurors in the Inquest which I have noticed under Dodicote. The next of this family who occurs was Thomas de Edelarton, Athelarton, or Allarton, as he is variously described. In 1253 he was Juror on a Newport Inquest,1 in 1260 on a Sheriff-Hales In quest, and in 1262 was a Regarder of the Forest. He occurs in similar positions in 1272, 1278, 1281, and 1283. Roger de Ethelarton, Juror on a Wellington Inquest in March 1304, is the next whom I find of this name. Pixley. Half the viU of Pixley is uniformly set down as a member of Chetwynd. The other half was, I presume, appurtenant to Cross- Hill, or to Hinstock, in which Parish the place is situated. Whatever here belonged to Chetwynd was probably at first a member of Sambrook. The Tenants here were Walter de Pikesley, Juror in the Dodicote Inquest of 1220 ;3 \u2014 Adam de Pikesley, Juror on a local Inquest in 1253 ; \u2014 Henry de Pikesley, Juror on two occasions in 1274, and also in 1283 ; \u2014 and William de Pikesley, a Juror in 1281, and Witness of a Deed (already quoted) in 1293.3 In Hilary Term 1283 a cause was tried at Shrewsbury which in dicates that part of Pixley was held, or presumed to be held, under the existing Lord of Sambrook. WiUiam de Kaynton, as son and heir of Robert de Kaynton, deceased, sued Richard Byde of Tib berton, as Tenant in possession of a messuage and virgate in Pic leslgh. Richard Byde called Roger Waldyng (of Sambrook) to war ranty, who appeared in warranty, and took a technical objection to the suit (one of mort d'ancestre), viz. that Robert de Kaynton had not died seized of the premises, having made them over to the pre sent Plaintiff long before his death. The Jury found otherwise, viz. that Robert de Kaynton had died seized, and that since his death his son had never been in possession. So the son recovered the estate and one merk damages. Moreover Roger Waldyng had to provide an equivalent for his ousted tenant.4 1 Elyas de Edelarton also occurs on a Jury of 1253. 3 Supra, p. 50. 4 Placita apud Salop. 11 Edw.

Turold found it waste; and so it remains.\"1 Such is the Domesday account of a Manor which has always since been considered a mere member of Chet wynd, but was held under the Chetwynds by a family of distinction. Hamo de Pivelesdon, a Recognizor in the Chesswell Trial of 1191, was surviving in June 1200, and then gave evidence as to what passed on the former occasion.3 In the same month of June he was a Visor appointed to ascertain the validity of an essoign de malo lecti, whereby the Abbot of Lilleshall was avoiding an appear ance in the Courts of Westminster. Such an office as Hamo de Pivelesdon's was usually assigned to knights only. Richard de Pivelesdon occurs between the years 1225 and 1240, but only as a Witness of two Wombridge Charters. Roger de Pivelesdon, the next of this family, occurs as Clerk of the County on April 10, 1241, at which time John le Strange (III.) was Sheriff, and Nicholas de Wililey Under Sheriff.3 After this it is probable that Roger de Pivelesdon succeeded to the supe rior office of Nicholas de Wililey, and became John le Strange's immediate Deputy. It was not uncommon for such a Deputy to be styled simply Sheriff; and though Roger de Pivelesdon never appeared at the Exchequer as Sheriff of Shropshire, he is twice called Sheriff in matters which probably occurred between the years 1241 and 1248. The first is as witness of a Haughmond Charter, the next as presiding over an Inquest concerning the Forest immu nities of LUleshall Abbey, in which instance he is styled Roger de Pynelesdon then Sheriff of Salop and Stafford. There are instances of Roger de Pivelesdon attesting Charters before he was Clerk of the County. I refer to one such.4 It would be vain to recapitulate his various attestations in different parts of the County, and after he ceased to be Deputy- Sheriff. The pro babUity is that he was a stirring man of business. In 1255 we see 3 Blakeway's Sheriffs, Preface, p. v. 4 Supra, Vol. II. p. 16. 1 Domesday, so. 257, b, 2. 2 Supra, p. 28."], [550, "96 PILSON. him with the custody of two Manors, Detton and HuUe,1 a custody which he had probably purchased with the wardship of the heirs. We see him with landed interests at Donington and Farlow, the latter given in marriage with his daughter Alice to Robert de Har ley.2 In Michaelmas Term 1253 he was second Juror on an Inquest concerning the Patronage of Haughmond Abbey. In January 1256 he occurs as a Surety for a Fine proffered by the Prior of Wenlock. That he was a knight is certain ; and I think that he had attained the dignity before 1254. The latest attestations of Sir Roger de Pivelesdon belong to the interval between 1260 and 1265. He was deceased in 1272, leaving a widow, Agnes, and a son and heir, Thomas. I have as yet said nothing that wUl connect Roger de Pivelesdon with Pilson; and indeed I doubt whether he had as much interest there as either of the two following persons, who were his cotemporaries and probably his relations. \u2014 William de Pyvlesdon has been mentioned as witness of a Charter about 1253,3 and I have little doubt but that he was the person who as WUliam de Pulleston was presented in 1256, by the Sheriff of Salop and Staffordshire, among those who had 15 librates of land and yet were not knights. Jordan de Pynelesdon, another cotemporary of Roger, follows him in attesting a High ErcaU Deed which certainly passed in 1256. And this Jordan had clearly some concern in Pilson, as the foUow ing Fine, levied Feb. 9, 1256, will prove. Odo de Hodenet had claimed a carucate of land in Wyletowe against the said Jordan, Tenant thereof, and by writ of mort d'ancestre. He now renounces his claim, and Jordan in turn conceded half the premises, to hold to Odo and his heirs, under Jordan and his heirs, at 1 2c?. rent. The residue of the premises was to remain with Jordan, \u2014 to hold of the superior Lords of the Fee. That the locality here described as Wyletowe, was part of Pilson, and is the place stUl to be recognized under the name of Whitley Barn, is very evident : for the Fine itself enumerates the parcels of land which were thenceforth to be held by Odo de Hodenet. They were \" half of the field towards Forton, half of the field towards Pykestok (Pickstock), half of the field towards Flotesbrok (Flash brook), half the capital messuage, half Whyletowemor (Whitley moor), half the meadow in Le Clun, and the whole meadow near the bridge of Pywesdon (Pilson).\"* 1 Supra, Vol. IV. pp. 282, 344. 2 Supra, Vol. II.p.177; Vol. IV.p.192. | 3 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 336. 4 Ita quod dimidium illius campi ver-"], [551, "ANTIQUITIES OF SHROPSHIRE BY THE REV.

In 1272 he was in the King's prison for some offence undeclared. He attests a charter of Shrewsbury Abbey which must have passed between 1272 and 1278. He occurs also in 1292, as will presently appear. We may now pass on to notice several other cotemporaries of this family. \u2014 Roger de Pywelesdon was in 1279 put on a commission to in quire into the conduct of the Sheriff of Herefordshire. In 1283 he was an Assessor and Collector of the tax of the thirtieth in Staffordshire.1 In 1293-4 the taxes necessary for the French war were attempted to be levied in Wales. This caused the well-known insurrection of Madoc ; and the Welsh Chronicle assures us that Roger de Peuelesdon, a Collector of this tax and a commander of certain Welsh Soldiers, was hanged and beheaded by the insur gents.3 It is very probable that this Sir Roger was of Pilson, for I find him attesting Newport Deeds between 1285 and 1292. On July 26, 1288, at Assizes held at Newport, \u2014 Roger son or Master Thomas de Pyvelesdon sued Roger son of Jordan de Pyvelesdon, Alice his wife, Richard son of Jordan, and Adam de Legh for disseizing him of half an acre of waste in Pyvelesdon. The person here called Richard fitz Jordan was, I think, identical with Master Richard de Pywelesdon, whom Master Thomas de Pywelesdon, Hugh de Beaumes, and others, undertook, at the Assizes of 1292, to produce at the further man date of the King or his Justiciars. Master Richard de Pillisdon, be it further observed, is entered in the Feodary of 1285 as hold ing Waranshall (a member of Stoke upon Tern or rather of More ton Say) under the Lords thereof. There we shall hear more of him. Again, in the year 1292, we have seen Roger son of Thomas de Pulesdon and Master Richard de Pulesdon, joining in an act of mon centre. Tbe map will sbow such geo graphy to be impossible. What I imagine to be intended is the northern half of the field towards Forton, the southern halves of the fields towards Pickstock and Flash brook, and so forth : but it is never easy to understand the land-surveying of the 13th century, neither do I know what was the distinction between Boreas aniJquilo, taken in the above document. sus Forton et versus Boream, et dimidium campi versus Pykestok et Austrum, et di midium campi versus Flotesbrok et Aus trum, et dimidium totius capitalis mes suagii versus Aquilonem, et dimidium Whylelowemor versus Boream, et dimi dium prati in le Clun versus occidentem, simul cum toto Mo prato juxta pontem de Pywesdon, remanebit Odoni.

Suretiship.1 In the same year we have Roger son of Jordan de Pivelesdon demising a curtilage in Pivelesdon to Roger son of Master Thomas de Pivelesdon \u2022? and the last Roger was one of the Jurors for Bradford Hundred at the Assizes of 1292- After this, Roger son of Jordan de Pivelesdon occurs in the fol lowing capacities : \u2014 viz. as second Juror in a Bolas Inquest taken about June 1301, and as Assessor and Collector, in Shropshire, of the tax of the fifteenth, granted by Parliament in January 1301, and still in course of collection in 1302, and as witness of a New port Deed in 1315. I have further to notice of Roger son of Thomas de Pivelesdon, that in June 1300 he was one of the Jurors on the great Peram bulation of the Forests of Shropshire, and that in May 1304 he was second Juror on a Donington Inquest. Meanwhile and down to a later period we have frequent notice of a Roger de Pivelesdon, or Peulesdon, without any patronymic distinction to identify him with either of the above. He attests a Deed dated at Newport, April 5, 1293 ; was fourth Juror on a Tong Inquest in July 1296 ; second Juror on a Bolas Inquest in May 1302 ; fourth Juror on a Little-Buildwas Inquest in December following; fifth witness of a Donington Deed about 1312; \u2014 last witness of a Tong Deed in June 1314; \u2014 and first witness of a Donington Deed in April 1324. Richard de Peulesdon, who occurs in 1309 and 1310 as a Commissioner of Levies in North Wales and the Marches, was per haps the same with Master Richard, son of Jordan. There lived in the same reign \u2014 Thomas de Peulesdon, of Staffordshire, styled Valettus in 1311, when he was addressed as Commander of certain Shropshire levies. He occurs again in 1322 as Manucaptor for an adherent of the Rebel Earl of Lancaster. Also there was one \u2014 Philip de Peulesdon, a Leader of Levies, raised in the Lord ship of Ellesmere in 1316. \u2022 Lastly there was a \u2014 Hugh de Peulesdon, a man-at-arms, summoned from Shrop shire to attend a Great Council at Westminster in May 1324.3 Pickstock. That part of Pickstock Township which is now in Chetwynd Parish, was originally a member of Pilson. I give extracts of two Deeds in illustration of this \u2014 About 1290-1300, \"Roger son of Thomas de Pyvelesdon gives 1 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 346. 2 Blakeway's Sheriff's, p. 37. 3 Parliamentary Writs, IV. 1285."], [555, "99 LAWLEY. to Roger de Flossebroc, Tanner (Bercario) and Amice his wife, three parcels of waste in the fields of Pixtok, whereof one, measuring 220 feet by 55 feet, lay in the field between Pyxtok and Pyvlusdon, and adjoined land which Roger-on-the-Grene of Pixtok was holding under the Grantor. Another parcel adjoined lands of Roger de Pixtok and Roger fitz Ralph. The Grantees and their heirs were to hold the whole, not under the Grantor, but under the Lords of the Fee. Witnesses, John Lord of Chetewynde ; Roger son of Jordan de Pyvelesdon, Roger de Ethelarton, Roger de Pixtok, and Robert de Pixtok.\" A somewhat later transaction between precisely the same parties shows us, how much a man's name might vary with the place of his re sidence. \"Roger de Flossebroc, Tanner,\" is now \"Roger fitz William of Pyestoke.\" To him and Amice his wife, Roger son of Master Thomas de Pywelesdon gives all that messuage and land which Roger-on-the-Grene of Pyestoke had previously held under the Grantor for a term. He gives also all his own arable land in the fields of Pyestoke with a parcel of land caUed Le Aspes, reserving to himself and his heirs two pieces of land in Hare-medewe-heth, and all his share of unreclaimed land in Pyestoke, and an acre of land lying nearest to the vill of Pywelesdon. He concedes also all his meadows and moors in Picstoke ; \u2014 the whole to be held by the Grantees and the heirs of Roger fitz William, with all such privileges in the township of Pyestoke as had been enjoyed by the Grantor's Ancestors, by payment of 16s. annual rent to the Lords of the Fee. The Grantor received for this 4 merks, and (apparently as an after thought) reserved to himself a messuage and land which Richard Scachard of Pyestoke held under him.

Now it is worth 10s.\"1 This estate followed the usual course of Turold's Manors, viz. that what Turold held under the Earl, came to be held by De Chet wynd under Fitz Alan. As regards the Under-tenure too of Hunnit, the general rule, already laid down,3 holds good with respect to Lawley. It passed from Hunnit to the descendants of another Saxon, viz. Toret ; and from Toret to Corbet of Moreton. In 1180 Peter fitz Thoret was amerced half a merk by Justices of the Forest for waste in Lauel' . Bartholomew Toret, who lived in the reigns of John and Henry III., gave a virgate in Lawley to the White Ladies of Brewood. The gift was \" with his Sister Gundred,\" who evidently became one of the Sisterhood. The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 describes the whole of Laue leg as a hide and a half, \u2014 exactly the Domesday estimate. It adds that Robert Corbet holds a moiety (he really held two-thirds) under the fee of John de Chetewind. Then (after giving the tenure of the 2 virgates which were of the Fee of Wem as before noted) the Record proceeds to state how the White Nuns of Brewood had ac quired and still held one virgate under Robert Corbet. The Manor did suit to the Hundred twice a year at the Sheriff's Towns, and paid 4c?. stretward? The Feodary of 1284, known as Kirby' s Quest, would indicate an unaccountable change in the mesne-tenure of this Manor, for the Chetwynds would seem now to have no concern here, and with them Fitz Alan's Seigneury to have vanished also. \" Robert Cor bet,\" says the Record, \" holds half the Vill of Laueleye under Wil liam de Hodnet, and he holds it of the King in capite.\" The Bradford Tenure-Roll, about the same period, repeats the above statement verbatim ; and actually enumerates \" half the vill of Law ley\" among the members of Hodnet, when that Manor is in its turn described.

The Inquests taken in 1301 on the death of Robert Corbet of Moreton rightly make him to have had both shares of Lawley. We have seen how he purchased the one share from Walter de Stanton \u2022? but of the share now under notice, the Inquest says that \" Robert Corbet had had 36*. . assized rent in Laueleye, receivable from seven VUlains; and that these tenements were held by the deceased under WUliam de Hodnet by service of 3s. (per annum).\"2 Of Undertenants here I may name Hugh Faber, assessed, in 1180, at 4s. for a smithy (fabrica) in Laueleia; such an erection being, I presume, a pourpresture. The men of Laueleia were at the same time assessed 3s. 6c_. for imbladements of 3\u00a3 acres of wheat. In 1209 Lauelegh is named as one of the Vills which were within Regard of the Forest of Mount Gilbert, and its Freeholders were assessed accordingly. One Alan de Laueleg occurs as a Witness about 1220-30. 3 At the Forest- Assize of 1262 one Thomas de Lawley is entered on the list entitled Essonia mortis. He was dead, I presume. Ralph de Lawley appeared in his stead. Previous to the Assizes of 1272, Richard de Cherleton had been suing Robert fitz Reginald for one fifth of a virgate in Lauele. His suit had been under a Writ de recto, and before the County Court. His title rested on the some time seizin of his mother, Matilda. The Tenant appealed to a trial by Grand Assize, but the result does not appear.4 The history of this Manor is one of some uncertainty, but in volving points of exceeding interest. In Saxon times it was of the inheritance of the Earls of Mercia. In Domesday it appears as the chief of those thirteen Manors which Turold de Verley held under the Norman Earl. \u2014 \" Turold holds Langeford of Earl Roger.

He (Turold) found it waste.\"1 Any attempt to identify the Domesday Berewicks of Longford must be partly conjectural. I take it that ChesweU, near Long ford, was certainly one, and that Stirchley, though eight miles dis tant, was certainly another. Perhaps Culmayre, a place anciently annexed to Stirchley, was a third. If Evelith, near Shiffnal, was not the fourth, I know not where the fourth was. Supposing this identification to be right, the foUowing analogies are observable. Longford with three of its members, viz. ChesweU, Stirchley, and Cul mayre, are found associated at a later date in such a way as to make it quite credible that they were originaUy one, as to tenure. But they formed an exception to the usual descent of Turold's Manors, that is, they never passed to the Chetwynds, nor to the Fief which Chetwynd held under Fitz Alan. But with Evelith it was other wise. That estate, as I have already shown,3 did continue to be of the Fee of Chetwynd, and was considered a member of Moreton Corbet rather than of Longford. This was perhaps because More ton Corbet remained in the Fee of Chetwynd, whUe Longford did not. The Undertenancy of Stirchley and Evelith renders it very probable that they were originaUy members of the same Manor, for Fitz-Toret first, and Corbet afterwards, held them both, \u2014 held, that is, Stirchley of the Fee of Longford, and Evelith of the Fee of Chetwynd. Again, it is remarkable that while we suppose Longford to have lost its Domesday member, Evelith, we find the loss balanced by the gain of a member, which had constituted a distinct Manor at Domesday. This was Brockton, which, except in Domesday, always appears as a mere member of Longford. King Henry I. is said on good authority to have granted 100 solidates of land in Longeford to a Feoffee unnamed, but who was ancestor of Eva de Longford, living in the reigns of Henry IL, Richard I., and John. Now such a grant of 100 solidates of land may easUy have led to that partial dismemberment or rearrange- 1 Domesday, so. 257, b. 1. | 2 Supra, Vol. II. p. 304 et seqq."], [559, "LONGFORD. 103 ment of Domesday Manors and Berewicks, which I have supposed. But the question here arises as to how Longford, a part of Turold's Fief, came into the hands of Henry I. ? I have endeavoured to answer that question already,1 and can say nothing further on the point. Either Hamo was the name of the person to whom Henry I. granted 100 solidates of land in Longford, or else that person was succeeded by Hamo, Lord of Longford. Hamo Lord of Longford was deceased in 1165, leaving two daughters, Eva and Agnes. Longford went to Eva and to her husband, Robert de Brimpton, by direction and express gift of Henry II. Of Sibil alias Basilia Fitz Odo, whose husband I now know to have been the above Hamo, I have spoken before under Rushbury.2 Her estate there passed, like her husband's estate at Longford, to their daughter Eva. Be sides his Shropshire estates Hamo de Longford seems to have held the following, viz. one knight's-fee at Church Eaton and Orslow (Staffordshire), under the Barons Stafford ; two-thirds of a knight's fee at Mid- Aston (Oxfordshire) under the same Barons ; and half a knight's-fee in Ywerne ; \u2014 but where Ywerne was, or who was Sei gneural Lord thereof, I have not inquired. Eva de Longford, daughter of Hamo, was given by Henry II. in marriage to Robert de Brimpton. This person took his name from Brimpton, in Berk shire, a manor which he held under the Mortimers of Wigmore. As Lord of Longford, in right of his wife, Robert de Brimpton became a Tenant in capite. Hence the Feodary of 1165, called the Liber Niger, contains a Carta or return from Robert de Brinton. He acknowledges himself to hold one knight's-fee, of old feoff ment, \"which,\" says he, addressing the King, \"thou gavest me with a certain gentle woman (fiber d muliere), named Eva, who is heir thereof, by service of one knight, my service being to be performed at thy -charges.\"3 This Carta must be taken to allude to Longford and its adjuncts. It is repeated in duplicate under Shropshire and Staffordshire, but one tenure in capite is its oiUy subject. Another fobo of the Liber Niger would indicate Robert de Brienton's tenure under the Baron Stafford to have been only one-fourth of a knight's-fee; but the passage is self- contradictory, and probably corrupt.4 The allusion is doubtless to Robert de Brimpton's tenure of Church Eaton and Orslow. I think that his service thereon was a whole knight's-fee. 3 Liber Niger, I. pp. 140, 148. 4 Ibidem, p. 138. 1 Supra, Vol. II. p. 47. 2 Supra, Vol. IV. p. 102. -"], [560, "104 LONGFORD. Robert de Brienton, with consent of his wife Eva, gave the Church of Eaton to Polesworth Nunnery (Warwickshire) ? This he is expressed to have done as heir of Edelina ; but I conceive that his wife Eva was the heiress of Eaton, and that she derived it from her father, Hamo. That Hamo may have derived from some Ede lina, I can only suggest generally, knowing nothing of the circum stances. It appears that Robert de Brinton gave the Church of Longford to Shrewsbury Abbey. His gift is the last and perhaps the most recent of those enumerated in Henry II.'s Confirmation of July 1155.3 As the King had then been only a few months on the throne, it is hereby proved that Robert de Brimpton's marriage, and investiture in Longford, must belong to that interval. Robert de Brimpton seems to have subsequently quarrelled with the Monks of Shrewsbury. In the time of hostilities, by which I understand the rebellion of 1173-4, he violently wrested the Cha pel of Kinardeshey (Kinnersley) from the Monks. In or before the year 1185 Robert de Brimpton died. He left issue at least two sons, Adam and John; and his wife Eva survived him. She of course continued in seizin of all which she had derived from her Father, Hamo, and therefore of Longford. On October 22, 1185, a Fine (one of the earliest on Record) was levied at Westminster, between Eva de Longeford, as she is styled, and the Monks of Shrewsbury. Geoffrey Bishop of Ely, John Bishop of Norwich, and Ranulph de Glanvill were the presiding Justices. By this Fine the Abbot of Shrewsbury renounced all claim to the Church of Longe ford, his title to which had been disputed by Eva. Eva in return restored the Chapel of Kinardeshey to the Abbey, which Robert de Bruminton, her husband, had in time of hostilities so violently wrested from the Monks.3 In 1190 or 1191 Eva de Longeford took a second husband; for the Pipe- Roll of the latter years exhibits Walter de Witefeld ac counting for a Fine of 15 merks by which he had obtained Eva de Langeford and her land. The last instalment of this Fine was paid in 1194. It was with reference to his temire-in-capite of a knight's-fee in Longford, that we find Walter de Witefeld assessed to the following 1 Dugdale's Warivicksh. (Thomas), p. 1108. Robert de Stafford's grant of the Church of Etton to Pollesworth was pro bably the confirmatory act of the Suzerain. It is expressed to be \" quantum in ipso suit\" (Pat. 21 Rich.

The last payment is expressed as relieving Walter de Witefeld from transfretation in the army of Normandy. Again, in 1199 Walter de Whitefeld fined 40s. ne transfretet ; but he was at the same time assessed at two merks, for one fee, to the cotemporary scutage. He paid 20s. only, the sum proportioned to three-fourths of a fee, and the abatement was al lowed at the Exchequer, because of his Fine, and because the other fourth of his knight's-fee was held by him in demesne. In 1201 Walter de Witefeld was assessed 2 merks to the second scutage of King John. In 1202 his proper assessment, of two merks, to the third scutage, was covered by a Fine of 5 merks. In 1203 a Fine of 6 merks, in composition of the fourth scutage, was treble the or dinary assessment. In 1204 a Fine of 10 merks was in fact pay ing fourfold the average assessment of 2\\ merks per fee to- the fifth scutage. To the sixth scutage of King John, in 1205, Walter de Witefeld was not assessed; but in 1206, to the seventh scutage (of 20s. per fee) he paid 2 merks. To the scutage of Poitou in 1214, Walter de Whitfeld paid the average assessment, viz. 40s. on one fee, quod suit Roberti de Brinton. Leaving for the present this matter of scutages, I must recur to other portions of my subject. \u2014 In Easter Term 1198 a suit com menced between the Abbess of Polesworth on the one hand, and Walter de Witefeld and Eva his wife on the other, concerning the Advowson of Church Eaton. The particulars do not belong to Shropshire History, but in Michaelmas Term 1203 the Abbess got definite sentence in her favour, on the ground that the Abbess had had the Advowson by grant of Eva's ancestors. At the very commencement of King John's reign, that is before Michaelmas 1199, Walter de Witefeld negotiated a Fine of 15 merks, for having the King's Confirmation of the Charters of Henry I. and Henry II. concerning 100 solidates of land in Longeford, and also for having a Charter of Free-warren in the same Vill.1 The Shropshire Tenure-Roll of the year 1211 is in perfect keeping with this, for it records how Walter de Wytefeld, Knight, was a Tenant in capite, and owed the King the service of one knight, and how his land was worth 100s. (per annum)? Walter de Whitfield seems to have been the subject or mover of many litigious proceedings concerning his wife's inheritance. One I ! Testa de Nevill, p. 55. 1** 1 Oblata, p. 16. VIII."], [562, "106 LONGFORD. matter, in which he was mixed up, commenced indeed before his marriage. It related to ChesweU, a member of Longford, and was as follows. In 1191, as I infer from the Pipe-Roll, Ralph Arch deacon of Hereford and Robert de Witefeld were in eyre at Shrews bury. They seem to have had Robert de Shrewsbury and Robert de Haselec as associates. The four decided a case of novel disseizin, moved by Robert de Huntiland against Robert de Wodecot, in favour of Huntiland ; and Wodecot was left in misericordid. Thus much was recollected nine years afterwards by seven out of the twelve Recognizors who tried the cause ; but they did not recollect what seems to have been a material part of an aster-question, viz. \" whe ther Eva de Langford came into court and warranted the premises to Huntiland on this occasion.\" The seven Jurors should be named. They were Adam de Chetewind, Peter de Eiton, Hamo de Piveles don, Adam de Alarton (Ellerton), Philip de Buterey, Walter de Elpole (probably Epley or Apley), and Pagan de Cherinton. I suppose the fact was that Eva de Longford did warrant the pre mises to Huntiland, and that Robert de Woodcote conceiving him self entitled to a similar Warranty or an equivalent, sued the said Eva to obtain the same. I cannot otherwise account for an oblatum of one merk recorded on the Pipe- Roll of 1193. It was proffered by Eva de Langeford, its object being to obtain a recognition (a trial by Jury) in a cause pending between herself and Robert de Wude cote. I suppose Woodcote was now successful, but that his success was evaded by the Defendant and her husband. A Plea- Roll of Trinity Term 1194 would seem to show him endeavouring to secure an advantage gained. \u2014 \" Robert de Wudecot, as opposed to Walter de Witefeld (acting for his wife Eva), moves for his Record and Judgment concerning warranty of his Charter of Corshal, as it re mained on a former occasion in the Curia.\" Walter de Witefeld also seems to have moved for a new Writ, admitting him as a party to the suit.1 On November 25, 1194, Walter de Witefeld essoigned himself by Brien \" his man,\" and Eva de Langeford essoigned herself by Ber nard de Eston, in the Plea of land which they had against Robert de Wodecot. The Court adjourned the case to the Quinzaine of HUary (January 27, 1195).3 The Curial Records of 119.5 are lost, and we can only guess at the 1 Robertus de Wudecot petit versus Walterum de Witefeld, positum loco Eve uxoris sue^ recordum et judicium suum de warantid carte sue de Corshal. sicut remansit alid vice in Curid. Et Walterus petit breve per quod implacitet. 2 Rot. Cur. Regis, I. 126 ; II. 239."], [563, "107 LONGFORD. phases through which this Suit passed before it recurs again to view. I presume then that, at some adjourned hearingj and in the reign of Richard I., Robert de Woodcote established his right to have a warranty of the premises from Whitfield and his wife, and that they were consequently obliged to proceed against Huntiland as tenant in possession. HuntUand also seems to have reverted to the former decision in his favour. I consider it as a sequence of some such intervening steps that, \u2014 - On AprU 23, 1200, it is recorded on the Plea-Roll how the She riff had had certain orders on the subject. He had been ordered to ascertain, through the inquiries of lawful knights of the County, \" who were the Recognizors and Justiciars in the old case of Hunti land versus Wodecot concerning the land of Chershal,\" and to send two of the said knights with a report to Westminster and to send the Recognizors also. It now (April 23) appeared that neither Knights nor Recognizors were in attendance : so the Court made a more stringent order to the same effect, returnable on June 18 following.1 On that very day the seven Recognizors, already named, appeared at Westminster. The Record calls them, by mistake, Recognizors in the case of Witefield versus Huntingeland. That was the case now pending. They, in their account given to the Court, described what had occurred in the case of Huntiland versus Woodcote; I have already repeated their statement, and assigned the year 1191 as the probable date of the trial which they had to remember. I happen to know that two of the Justiciars who tried it were now dead, whilst the Recognizors themselves stated that a third, Robert de Shrewsbury, was now Bishop of Bangor. Had.it been otherwise, reference would probably have been made to the Justiciars them selves. As to their Rolls, we have here, by the way, a curious indi cation that the Curial Records of the early years of Richard I. were non-existent in the first year of John. On July 8, 1200, an order was made by the Court in the above case, but I cannot think that it is accurately recorded. I give it however as it stands, marking the suspected expression in Italics. \u2014 A day (in three weeks of Michaelmas) is given to Robert de Hun tiland, acting for his wife, and to Walter de Witefeld, acting for his wife Eva, in a plea concerning an assize of novel disseizin. A du plicate Roll is perhaps more correct. - It says \u2014 \" A day (in three weeks of Michaelmas) is given, by request of the parties, to Walter de Wittefeld and Robert de Huntiland, to hear judgment at West- i Rot.

And their pleadings (loquela) are enrolled on the Rolls of Trinity Term.\" I suppose that an order of April 15, 1201, was an adjourned or der in this case. Its terms are however hardly reconcilable with such an idea. The entry runs thus. \u2014 \" Dies datus est Wraltero de Hwitefeld et Roberto de Huntele de inquisicione factd de dote Eve uxoris ejusdem Walteri, \u2014 a die Sti. Michaelis in xv dies.\" The last that I hear of this Suit is on October 13, 1201, when Joceline Clerk, Attorney of Robert de Huntiland, having a Plea de audiendo judicio suo, against Walter de Witefeld, essoigns his attendance at Westminster. \u2014 Another Suit, which Walter de Whitfield had against the Abbot of Lilleshall, is indicated by the following entries on the Plea-RoUs of Westminster. \u2014 January 27, 1200. A day (in three weeks of Easter) is given to the Abbot of Lilleshall (essoigning himself by Robert Burell) in a Placitum averiorum, against Walter de Witefeld. June 18, 1200. Adam de Chetwind, Pagan de Cherinton, Hamo de Pivelesdon, and Adam de Alartun, who had been sent to the Abbot of Lilleshall to ascertain whether the infirmity, by which he was essoigning himself, in a suit against Walter de Witefeld, was real sickness (languor) or not, report that he is sick (languidus), and that they (the Visors) had given him a day, viz. in one month from the morrow of St. Dunstan, at the Tower of London. Oct. 13, 1201. A day (in one month of Easter) is given to the Abbot of Lilleshall (represented by Benjamin, his Canon) and to Walter de Witefeld and Eva his wife, to hear their sentence in a Plea of Convention concerning the Bosc of Lilleshall. Again, an important suit was at this same time pending between Walter de Whitfield and Eva his wife on the one hand, and Agnes, sister of the said Eva, on the other. Agnes is sometimes caUed \" de Stockton,\" I suppose with reference to a deceased husband. First we have a Fine of 20 merks, given to the Crown in 1195 by \"Agnes daughter of Hamo de Langeford,\" that she might have trial concerning a fair portion of her Father's lands, in Langeford, Eaton, Horslage, Eston, and Iwerne, against Walter de Witefeld and his wife Eva. The following entries on the Westminster Plea- Rolls relate to this Suit. Oct. 27, 1199.

Staffordshire. Agnes de Stocton owes the King (a further fine of) half a merk, for having her cause argued (at Westminster I presume) against Walter de Witefeld and Eva his wife, which cause had been adjourned till the arrival of Justices (itinerant). Nov. 12, 1201. A day (January 27) is given to Walter de Witef and Agnes de Stokton. On January 20, 1203, a Fine was levied at Westminster between Agnes de Stokton, Plaintiff, and Walter de Witefeld and Eva his wife, Tenants, of half a knight's-fee in Langeford, half a knight's fee in Eiton (Church Eaton), a fourth part of a knight's-fee in Ywerne, a moiety of two-thirds of a knight's-fee in Eston (Mid- Aston, Oxfordshire), and a moiety of 1-g hides of land, &c, in Cotes and in Walles (Coates and Eastwall, near Rushbury), whereof was Suit-at-law between the parties. Agnes now quitclaimed all her right in the aforesaid lands and fees, and in the inheritance of Hamund, father of herself and Eva. She quitclaimed the same in favour of Walter and Eva and the heirs of Eva. In return Walter and Eva conceded to Agnes that half-hide less one bovate, in Brac ton (Brockton), which Agnes had previously held, also one bovate, which laid between the two Coppices (bruilia) of Haresden and Witheges, so as to make up a full half-hide. Also they conceded to Agnes that half-virgate in Bracton which Roger fitz Ralph held, with the messuage and appurtenances thereof, saving the Vivary and Coppice of the said vill of Bracton to Walter and Eva, and the heirs of Eva. Further, they conceded to Agnes half a hide in Hors lawe (Orslow) , saving to themselves the Vivary and Mill of Hors lawe and one croft near the Vivary, which Adwin held : \u2014 the whole to be held by Agnes and her heirs, under Walter and Eva and the heirs of Eva, the Tenants doing the forinsec service proportionate to the land. Lastly, Walter and Eva gave Agnes 20 merks in money. It is evident that Agnes de Stockton, though dejure a Coheiress with her sister Eva, was all but disinherited. The original parti tion, so favourable to Eva, had been made early in Henry II.'s rei\u00b0*n : and the question remains as to how far it was the practice of that \u00e6ra to abridge the rights of younger coheiresses. against all Lawsuits, whether he actually embarked for foreign service, or com pounded for not doing so. 1 Vide supra, p. 105. It would seem that, on the levy of any Scutage, a Mili tary Tenant of the Crown was protected"], [566, "110 LONGFORD. The Shropshire Pipe-RoU of 1205 shows Agnes de Stocton fining half a merk that some (new) trial between her and Walter de Whitefeld might proceed. In the same year I find notice of a Staffordshire Suit, where Wal ter de Witefeld and his wife Eva, represented by Adam de Brim ton (Eva's son I think), were opposed to Alice de Hopeton, concerning 1^ knight's-fees in Hopeton and Thene, but I can hardly decipher the Record, much less suggest its bearing on our present subject.1 In Easter Term 1208, Robert de Wodecote and MUisent his wife and Agnes wife of Robert2 acknowledged at Westminster that, in regard of their VUlain-tenants, they owed suit to the MiU of Horse lawe, as required by Walter de Witefeld and his wife Eva on the strength of a previous Fine.3 We have seen that Walter de Whitfield was assessed to a Scu tage in 1214. Within two years of that time it is evident that his stepson, Adam de Brimpton, had succeeded to his maternal inheri tance and was in rebellion against King John. A Writ-Close of September 15, 1216, requires the Sheriff of Salop and Staffordshire to give Adam de Brimpton's lands to his Brother John, seeing that Adam was with the King's enemies.4 On Nov. 4, 1217, a Writ of King Henry III. orders the Sheriff to reinvest Adam de Brimton with his lands, he having returned to his fealty.5 At the Assizes of 1221 Adam de Brimton was one of the knightly Jurors who tried cases of Grand Assize. His1 assessments to scutages in respect of a knight's-fee in Shropshire were as follows. \u2014 In 1218, to the first scutage of Henry III., 2 merks; in 1221, to the scutage of Biham, no assessment; in 1224, to the scutage of Montgomery, 2 merks ; but to the scutage of Bedford, an acquit tance ; in 1229, to the scutage of Keri, 2 merks ; in 1230, to the scu tage of Brittany, an acquittance ; in 1231, to the scutage of Poitou, an acquittance ; in 1232, to the scutage of Elvein, an acquittance. On January 26, 1236, Adam de Brimpton (I.) being dead, the King orders the Sheriff of Shropshire to take security for 100s., the Relief due from his son Adam, whose homage the King had ac cepted. The Sheriff is forthwith to give seizin to the heir of all such lands as his father had held in capite? The Pipe-Roll of 1236 1 Robert de Boc appears as Alice de Hopeton's Attorney. A family named Bee afterwards held Hopton and Thene under the Barons Stafford. Jordan de Toke, William de IpBtanes, William de Gresley, and Thomas de Halghton, were Recognizors in the cause. 2 Identical with Agnes de Stockton. 3 Abbrev.

This change, or succession, may perhaps account for Longford not having been assessed to the Aid of 1235-6. In or about the year 1240, various Feodaries record Adam de Brimton' s different Tenures. In Shropshire he held 1 fee in capite in Langeford; in Staffordshire, 1 fee of the Baron Stafford in Eyton (Church Eaton) and Orselawe ; in Oxfordshire, half a fee of the Baron Stafford in Middel-Eston ; and in Berkshire, 1 fee in Brimton under Ralph de Mortimer.1 The Shropshire Pipe-RoU of 1242 records Adam de Brimton as paying 1 merk, de fine pro passagio. I suppose he had obtained quittance from foreign service. In 1254 Adam de Brimton was returned among those who held 20 librates of land in Salop and Staffordshire. The Bradford Hundred-RoU of 1255 speaks thus of Longford. \u2014 \" Adam de Brin ton holds the Manor of Longheford, with its appurtenances, in capite of the King, by service of a knight's-fee in time of war, at his own charges. He does suit neither to County nor Hundred; by what warranty of exemption the Jurors know not.\"3 Adam de Brimpton (II.) was assessed to Aids and Scutages as foUows, in respect of his Shropshire fee, viz. \u2014 in 1245, to the Aid on marriage of the Princess Royal, \u00a31 ; in 1246, to the Scutage of Gannok, an acquittance; in 1254, to the Aid for knighting Prince Edward, \u00a32 ; and in 1260, to the Scutage of Wales, an ac quittance. The Pipe-RoU of 1261 shows a sum of \u00a37. 10s., paid by the Sheriff to Hoel ap Madoc, Thomas de Roshal, and Adam de Bring ton. This was for their expenses in proceeding to the Ford of Montgomery as Commissioners to treat about a truce with Lewel lyn. The Writ of Diem clausit on the death of Adam de Brimpton (II.) bears date June 20, 1274. The Oxfordshire Inquest found him to have held li hides in Midel Eston under the Baron Stafford, and a messuage there, under Thomas de Clare. Adam, his son and heir, was 30 years of age and more. The Staffordshire Inquest found him to have held Eyton (Church Eaton) under the Baron Stafford, by service of a knight's-fee and certain suits of Court. The Shropshire Inquest, held at Newport on July 3, 1274, found him to have held Longeford in capite by service of one knight's-fee. He was bound at his own cost to provide a Guard with a barbed horse 1 Testa de Nevill, pp. 45, 46, 102, 109. | 2 Rot. Hundred. II. 55."], [568, "112 LONGFORD. for 40 days whenever the King in person approached Wales. The total annual value of the Manor was \u00a38. 13s. 10c..1 It was Adam de Brinton (III.) who, having obtained livery of his Father's lands on July 10, 1274, was summoned for service against Lewellyn in the summer of 1277. He acknowledged his tenure at Longford in the usual form and, being a knight, proposed to discharge his service in person.3 The Feodaries of 1284-5 register Adam de Brimton's service for Longford as only half a knight's fee. Brockton and Chrestill (ChesweU) are reckoned as members of the Manor. Adam de Brimton held his free court here, twice in the year, and judged pleas of bloodshed and hue-and-cry. He had gallows and warren, and exercised his rights in these respects. In January 1287 Adam de Brinton was put in commission as a Conservator of the peace for Berkshire. In October 1292 he was one of the knightly Jurors who tried several Pleas of Quo Waranto in Shropshire. In 1297 he was summoned for foreign service as a Tenant of 20 librates of land and upwards in Berkshire and Shrop shire. In 1298, as a Staffordshire landowner, he had military sum mons against the Scots. In 1300 he sat in Parliament as a Knight of the Shire for Berkshire. In 1301 he had military summonses against the Scots in respect of his tenure in Oxfordshire, in Berk shire, and in Shropshire.3 The Writ of Diem clausit on the death of Adam de Brimton (III.) bears date May 10, 1315. The subsequent Inquests notice only his tenures at Church Eaton and Longford. Of the latter Manor it is said that the deceased held it in capite of the Escheat of Earl Roger (read Robert de Belesme) by service of half a knight's-fee, and also of providing one armed horseman with a barbed horse for 40 days, at his own cost, to accompany the King's army in any Welsh war. Among the items of the estate, the capital messuage and garden are valued at 3s. 4d.per annum ; a carucate of land containing 60 acres at 20s. ; 6 acres of meadow at 9s. ; assized rents of free tenants, 9s. ; of customary tenants, 40s. ; and of cottagers, 3s.

In 1327 he sat in Parliament as a Knight of the Shire for Berkshire.3 Chesswell, the only member of the Domesday Manor of Long ford, which I should notice here, has no other facts connected with its early tenure than those already embodied under Longford. How there came to be a Grange at ChessweU, I have no evidence. Under Lilleshall Abbey I shall show that Chirshall Grange was among its possessions at the Dissolution : but the Chartulary of that House does not give particulars of such an acquisition. LONGFORD CHURCH. Nothing in the Domesday notice of Longford indicates the then existence of a Church. The same may be said of Edgmond, but we know from other Records that there was a Church at Edgmond as early as Domesday, and that the said Church had several Chapels or affiliations. Among them I reckon Longford. We have seen the Advowson of Longford granted to Shrewsbury Abbey in 1155 and surrendered back to the Lady of the Manor in 1185. Probably the Monks had some original claim to the Advowson as Patrons of the Church of Edgmond. The Taxation of 1291, placing the Church of Longeford in the Deanery of Newport, values it at \u00a32 per annum? In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth taxed the Parish at 30s., saying that 3s. of the Church-Income was derived from Glebe and Demesne of the Church, and 7s. from other sources (than those which were con templated in the present assessment) ?

For the most part of two centuries after Domesday it continued dependent on Longford, though in some respects it attained such a manorial status as that I am in duced to treat of it under a separate head. I should be inclined to believe that Hunnit and his brother Uluiet were the two Milites, whom Domesday notices as holding four out of the six hides which constituted Turold's Manor of Longford ; and that part of the said four hides lay at Stirchley and perhaps at Evelith. The Fitz Torets succeeded to Hunnit's and Uluiet's tenures under Turold in three known instances, viz. at Law ley, Moreton-Toret (now Moreton-Corbet), and Preston-Brockhurst. When I find that the Fitz Torets claimed to hold Stirchley under the Lords of Longford, and that they established their claim, I cannot but think that their title to all four tenures was of like nature, i. e. as representing Hunnit and Uluiet. It will simplify what I have to say about Stirchley if I state that about the years 1160-70 it was held as follows. It was held in capite by Robert de Brimpton in right of his wife Eva. Peter fitz"], [571, "STIRCHLEY. 115 Toret held it under De Brimpton. Under Peter fitz Toret, and by a rent of 3 dwts. of gold, Osbert de Stirchley was Tenant-in-fee of the Manor. I have said something about Osbert de Stirchley, alias de Diddlebury, in a former Volume.1 On the Pipe- Roll of 1167, he is called Osbert de Stircheleg; and is entered as owing a sum of half a merk, in which he had been amerced by Alan de Nevill (Justice of the Forest). Again, the Pipe- Roll of 1176 re cords how Osbert de Stirchleg owed a Fine of 2 merks, because he had been present (at some Inquest probably) where the murder of one John had been hushed up (ubi excusatio de morte Johannis facta est). The Forest-Roll of 1180, under the head of Surchley, assesses one Osbert at 3s. for an imbladement of 6 acres of oats. We now lose sight for a time of the Tenant-in-fee of Stirchley, and find the Manor litigated between the Mesne and Seigneural Lords. In 1185 Eva, wife (probably widow) of Robert de Brinton, fined 20s. that she might have trial concerning a hide of land in Stirclea. She paid the Fine in that and the following year. It appears that this S uit, which was ultimately a Placitum Servitii, de scended to Walter de Whitfield (Eva's second husband) and to Bar tholomew fitz Peter (Peter fitz Toret's son). A Fine is authenti cally alluded to, whereby, in the time of Richard I., it was agreed that Bartholomew should hold a hide in Stirchley under Walter and Eva for a rent of 20s. per annum in lieu of all services. It next appears that one or other of the parties would not adhere to this Fine, and that a Placitum Cyrographi was the result. On October 27, 1199, the parties are called upon to attend at Westminster iu Hilary Term following, and hear judgment recorded in such a Plea. Eva de Longford was to be represented by her husband, and Bar tholomew Turet makes William de GrenehiU (Grindle) his At torney.2 In Hilary Term the Parties were resummoned for Easter Term \u2022 and then Judgment was pronounced, viz. that the Fine above described should hold good, and that Bartholomew should be quit by the specified service of 20s.3 \u2022 We know that this arrange ment continued for the best part of a century. The next Tenant-in-fee of Stirchley whom I can find, after'Os bert de Stirchley, is Richard de Stirchley. How he was related to Osbert I have never been able to discover, nor will I assert that he was Osbert's heir. This Richard has occurred to us repeatedly under the dates of 1203 and 1206.4 From one mention of his I * Supra, Vol. II. p. 124, note; Vol. | IV. p. 21; Vol. V. p. 32. > Supra, Vol. V. p. 178. 2 \u2022 3 Rot.

At the Assizes of 1203 the Prior of Wenlock essoigned himself in a suit which he had with Richard de Stirkele, and the cause was adjourned. The latest that I find of Richard de Stirchesleg is on the Pipe-RoU of 1207, where an amercement of 6s. 8c?., apparently for some forest matter, is re corded against him. I suppose that he died soon after, and that it was he whose heir Walter de Stirchley claimed to be in 1208. The claim, it wUl be remembered, involved estates at Diddlebury and Stirchley, which Walter de Stirchley was already seized of. I should suppose therefore that he claimed to hold them indepen dently of Osbert fitz William, the Plaintiff. The result as regards Diddlebury has been already stated, viz. that Walter became Os bert's Feoffee at a rent of 16s.1 But the Fine of Nov. 5, 1208, settled the hide in Stirchley in a different way. Walter was to hold it only for life, under Osbert or his heirs, and to pay the before mentioned services of 20s. and 3 dwts. of gold. These services were the chief-rents due from Osbert to the Seigneural and Mesne Lords (viz. Walter de Whitfield and Bartholomew Toret), and Os bert receiving them from Walter, covenanted to settle with the Superior Lords of the Fee. On Walter's death, the hide in Stirch ley was to revert to Osbert and his heirs. Between this period and his death in 1232 Walter de Stirchley has recurred often on former pages.3 His second Fine with Osbert fitz WiUiam was levied December 14, 1227. It made him Tenant for life, as before, of a hide in Stirchley, but it abridged the reversionary rights of Osbert fitz William; for, on Walter's death, half a virgate of land, one assart held by Alexander Carpenter, and one croft held by May dusa, were to remain with Walter's heirs ; \u2014 to be held under Osbert and his heirs at a nominal rent, viz. 2d., or half a pound of cummin. While Walter de Stirchley was thus holding Stirchley for life, Osbert fitz WiUiam appears more than once in the position of one who was more than a mesne-lord or yet a reversioner of the fee simple. In November 1221 he had a suit of mort d'ancestre with the Abbot of Buildwas. In this instance he is caUed Osbert de Diddlebury. It is all but certain that the quarrel was concerning something in Stirchley previously granted to BuUdwas by Richard de Stirchley. Again, Osbert,. Lord of Stirchley made a grant, al ready alluded to,3 of a parcel of land in \" his fee of Stirchley \" to Wombridge Priory. The grant is attested by Sir Leonard de Ley, 1 Supra, Vol. V. p. 178. 2 Supra, Vol. II. pp. 115, 125, 133, 327; I Vol. V. pp. 178, 179. 3 Supra, Vol. II. p. 315."], [573, "117 STIRCHLEY. Robert de Brocton, Roger de Eppeleg (Apley) , Robert de Haeman (probably Hamarse), Walter de Harpcote, and Walter, Chaplain of Stircheleg. It must have passed, I think, between 1220 and 1230, and so during the period of Walter de Stirchley's life-tenure. Again I find that Osbert de Styrchleg granted a halfpenny rent in Styrchleg to Lilleshall Abbey. This grant I have no means of dating, further than to say that it is recorded in Henry III.'s Confirmation of 1265. Walter de Stirchley died as I have said in 1232, and Matilda, his widow, forthwith claimed a third of a hide in Stirchley as her dower. The Fine by which she obtained for life that half-virgate only which Robert Pertrich held, bears date July 1, 1232. The point to observe therein is that instead of Osbert fitz WiUiam appearing as Tenant or Defendant, we have Osbern, Par son of Diddlebury, in that position. It is obvious either that Os bern the Parson was identical with, or the heir or assignee of, Osbert fitz William. In Michaelmas Term 1233 I find notice of a Suit concerning land, between the Prior of Wenlock and Osbert de Stirchlegh. The Attorney of the latter was Robert de Diddlebury, but no fur ther particulars transpire. The Pipe-Roll of 1234 exhibits Osbert de Stirchleg as fining half a merk pro habendd mencione, a phrase which I know to relate to the form of a Writ in some pending suit, and think must have related to the suit with Wenlock Priory. On April 18, 1238, a Fine was levied at Westminster between Hu bert, Prior of Wenlock (Plaintiff, through John Tece his Attorney) , and Osbert de Dodelebyr, Deforciant, of the Advowson of Stirch ley Church, whereof was Plea of Dernier presentment between the parties. Osbert surrendered his claim, and was received, he and his heirs, into all benefits and prayers of the Church of Wenlock for ever. Osbert de Diddlebury, alias Osbert fitz William, alias Osbert de Stirchley, is said on good authority to have sold half the Manor to Buildwas Abbey. The Abbey had already a footing here under grants of \" Richard, Uncle (avunculus) of the said Osbert,\" that is, I suppose, of Richard de Stirchley. Osbert's sale must have taken place about the year 1243 ; for in that year the Abbot withdrew certain suits, due from Stirchley to the Hundred of Bradford. No Deed is preserved whereby we can determine further particu lars of these grants of Osbert and his Uncle Richard ; but in or after the year 1247, Osbern fitz William surrendered aU his interest here to Buildwas, and of this fact we have threefold evidence, viz."], [574, "118 STIRCHLEY. one Fine and two Charters. The Fine bears date July 1, 1247, and, as conveying a much more limited estate than the Charters, must be taken to have preceded them. Thereby Osbert de Styrche leg (Impedient) acknowledges himself to have given to Nicholas, Abbot of Buildwas, two virgates in Styrcheleg, whereof had been Plea of Charter-warranty. The Abbot is to hold the premises under Osbert and his heirs, and to discharge forinsec services due thereon. But besides this Osbert conveys 2 virgates of land, '60 acres of bosc, and 2 Mills, which he had sometime held in demesne, also the capital messuage, half the garden belonging thereto, the great meadow between the two Mills, half Crumbwelle-meadow, 2 small parcels of Crumbwelle-meadow, half NordweUe-meadow, one small parcel of the same, and the homage and service of Robert Aleyn ;\u2014 all to be held in pure almoign, and to be recompensed by the prayers of the Monks in the Grantor's behalf. The Charters which foUow this Fine must be taken to confirm its grants, and to convey not only the residue of the Grantor's sub stantive interests in Stirchley, but to abohsh his mediate and more nominal rights. The earliest of these Charters is printed else where,1 and is in substance as follows. \u2014 \" Osbert fitz William, Lord of Stirchelege, gives to the Monks of Buldewas in free almoign the capital messuage of his House in the vill of Stirchelege, together with all buildings and appurte nances, and with half the great garden, and with a certain garden situated without the gate of his Manor-house (curia). He also gives 60 acres of his demesne in the said vill, and 36 acres with the bosc growing thereon, viz. whatever lay between John de Pertone's bosc and the bosc of the aforesaid Monks. He also gives the ho mages and services of John de Pertone and his heirs, of Ranulph de Colnham and his heirs, of Julian, son of Walter de Stirchley and his heirs, of Robert Aleyn and his heirs, of WiUiam de WodewaU and his heirs-, and of the widow Petronilla and her heirs, together with all rents, &c, which belonged to the Grantor, as Lord, or to his heirs, whether arising from the above tenements, from the tene ment of the Prior of Wombridge, or from the tenements of any others, claiming to hold under the Grantor, or from other lands and tenements, which the Monks already had in Stirchley by gift of the Grantor and his ancestors. In short, he retains nothing to himself at Stirchley except the prayers of the Grantees : but the Grantees are to pay 20s. and 3 dwts. of gold per annum to Richard Corbet2 1 Monasticon, V. 357, No. III. | 2 Now representative of the Torets."], [575, "119 STIRCHLEY. in lieu of all services, and Richard Corbet would acquit the Monks in respect of the item of 20s., which, in other words, he was bound to pay over to Adam de Brumton and his heirs. The witnesses of this Deed were, Sir Richard de Lectone ; Robert de Actone, Clerk ; J ohn de Bekeburi ; Clement fitz Peter ; Reyner Ruphus ; Richard de Grenhull ; Hamo le Poer, and others.\" Osbert fitz William's other Charter is perhaps a few days later than, but nearly a duplicate of, the above. Its differences are these. \u2014 It expresses the gift to be with the Grantor's body in burial (cum corpore meo) . It describes \" half the great garden \" as \" an or chard, already divided between the Grantor and John de Person.\" It describes the \" 36 acres of bosc, &c,\" as \" a certain parcel of land together with the bosc growing thereon.\" It enumerates Mills, among the appurtenances of the estate. It alludes to, and ratifies, the previous gifts of the Grantor \" and his Uncle Richard.\" It makes the reserved rents of Richard Corbet and Adam de Brumton to be payable by the Monks to each person immediately, viz. 3 dwts. of gold to the former, and 20s. to the latter. It is attested by Richard de Leghton ; Richard de Grenhull ; John de Bechebur' ; Robert de Acton, Parson of Stheyle (probably Stirch ley) ; and Ralph de Staunton.1 From a Fine of January 27, 1249, it would seem that, immedi ately after Osbert de Stirchley's death, the two daughters of Leonard de Legh (already spoken of under Parva Legh)3 claimed possession of several parcels of Stirchley against the Abbot of BuUdwas and his Tenants. They claimed under Writ of mort d'ancestre and therefore by inheritance. The Fine purports to be between Johanna de Legh and Nicholaha her sister (Plaintiffs) and Nicholas Abbot of Buildwas, concerning 2 messuages, 25 acres, a half-virgate and one noke in Stircheleg, held by the Abbot himself ;\u2014 concerning 2 messuages and 7 acres which the Abbot was bound to warrant to his Tenant, Robert Aleyn;\u2014 and concerning 3 acres which the Abbot was called upon to warrant to John de Person. The Plain tiffs surrendered their claim for 5 merks. Of the family of De Stirchley alias De Diddlebury I have little more to say. It is impossible, without further evidence, to decide the exact mode of their descent ; and I know that I am leaving several questions of identity unsolved. However, I have quoted, either here or under Diddlebury, all the documents which bear upon this genealogy, as they relate to each locality. Richard fitz Osbert ' Blakeway's MSS.

I refer to what I have said of him in a former Volume,1 where it wiU be seen that he was a Tenant at Longnor and Sheriff's-Clerk to Roger Sprenghose (III.). I proceed with Stirchley as mainly an estate of Buildwas Abbey, but in which the Abbot of Lilleshall and the Priors of Wenlock and Wombridge had each an interest. The Bradford Hundred- Roll of 1255 describes Stirchley as follows. \u2014 \" The Abbot of Buldewas bought half of Scirleg from Osbert de Scireleg, viz. half a hide, and it was wont to do suit to the Hun dred every three weeks, and he (the Abbot) withdrew the said suit twelve years ago to the annual loss of 2s. to the King. \" Randulph de Coleham holds one virgate in the said vUl under the Abbot of LilleshuU ; Ranulf de Person holds one virgate of the Abbot of Buldewas, and the Prior of Wenlock holds one noke of the same Abbot. \" After a while (postmodum) the said Abbot (of BuUdwas) bought of the said Osbert the demesne of the whole vill, except the land and service of the said Ranulf de Colleham. And the said viU owes 4c?. (per annum) for stretward. And the lands aforesaid, held by Ranulf de Colham and the others, contain another half-hide. The abstracted suit of the said Abbot of Buldewas is worth 2s. per annum, and he holds in capite of Adam de Brinton, who holds in capite of the King, and of Robert Corbet.\"3 I need not stop to specify the errors, manUest or suspected, which are involved in the above account. The sequel wUl rectify most of them : for instance, the Feodary of 1284 says with admirable cor rectness that \u2014 \" The Abbot of Buldewas holds the viU of Styrch leye of Robert Corbet, and he of Adam de Brimton, and he of the King.\" So too the Bradford Tenure-Roll of nearly the same date de scribes the Abbot as holding Sturcheleg and Culmayre under Robert Corbet, who holds under Adam Brimton, who holds in capite. \" Here,\" adds the Record, \" the Abbot holds his free Court by Charter of King Richard.\" The allusion is to King Richard's ge neral franchises vouchsafed to BuUdwas, which extended to all its previous possessions and subsequent acquisitions. The Taxation of 1291 gives the foUowing account of the Abbot of Buildwas's estate at Sirtheleye. \u2014 1 Supra, Vol. VI. pp. 59, 60. | \u25a0 Rot. Hundred.

The Vill had devolved \" 30 years back,\" said the Jurors to the Abbot of BuUdwas, who had withdrawn the above dues. The Abbot now came forward, and acknowledging his liabilities, was assessed at 4 merks for arrears. I have alluded under Cound to an exchange, contemplated in the year 1354, whereby the Manor of Stirchley would have passed from Buildwas Abbey to the Earl of Arundel.3 Though such an ex change did not take place to the extent contemplated, it is clear that Thomas Earl of Arundel who died in 1415 held Stirchley in socage under the Abbot of Buildwas, and that it was entailed on the heirs male of the Earl's body.3 It is further clear that the Earl had no such heirs, but what remainders there were in the en tail, or how the Manor again reverted to Buildwas, I cannot learn. William Abbot of Buildwas granted a sixty years' lease thereof; and on Sept. 29, 1534, when the said lease was unexpired, Stephen, last Abbot of BuUdwas, granted a further lease of 95 years, to commence on the expiration of the term of 60 years.4 The re served rent in Abbot Stephen's Lease is \u00a35. 13s. 4c/., the exact sum which in 1534-5 he returned in the Valor as the assized rent re ceivable by the Abbey from Strycheleye.5 The Minister's Accounts, two years later, also give \u00a35. 13s. 4d. as the Ferm of Stirchley Grange.6 Or Undertenants in Stirchley, the documents already quoted, under the dates of 1247, 1249, and 1255, have supplied a partial list. The Forest-Roll of 1262 enters Roger fitz Isabel and Henry Bagg of Stirchley on the list entitled Essonia Mortis.

Roger the Parson called Thomas de Pyvelesdon to warrant the Charter where by Roger de Pyvelesdon, his father, had conveyed the premises to Roger the Parson. It was first stated in excuse of Thomas de Pyvelesdon's appearance that he was in the prison of Doverya, but afterwards that Agnes, Roger de Pyvelesdon's widow, had everything for life. The Court decided that the Plaintiffs should at once re cover Edith's dower, but that Roger the Parson should be entitled to a further recovery against the heir of Thomas (sic) de Pyveles don, on the death of Agnes.1 At these same Assizes Ranulph de Colham (a tenant in 1248 and 1255) appears, as not prosecuting a suit against the Abbot of Haugmon for arrears of some annual rent. This was probably a Shrewsbury affair, but Ranulf's Sureties were John Bagge and Robert Dose of Stirchley. In Michaelmas Term 1288 Walter son and heir of Walter de Stirchley recovered, under judgment given, his seizin of three messuages, one toft, 3 acres of meadow, 4 acres of pasture, 20 acres of wood, and 1| carrucates of land, against Ranulph de Ko lenham (Coleham), James his son, and Walter son of Reginald de Stirchley.2 Perton Fee. This estate, though small, requires a distinct no tice. The family of Perton was seated at Perton in Staffordshire, where it held lands by serjeantry from an early period. The Lord of Perton and Trescot was bound to attend the King in any Welsh expedition with two horses, for eight days at his own cost, and if he remained longer, then at the King's cost. Ranulph de Perton who thus held Perton in 121 1,3 was deceased on Sept. 26, 1241, when John, his son and heir, obtained livery of his inheritance at Perton.4 This was the John de Perton whose services for an estate at Strichley were assigned about 1247-8 by Osbert fitz William to Buildwas Abbey. John de Perton died to wards the end of the year 1257.5 His son and heir, Ranulph de Perton (II.) , seems to have been seized of the Stirchley estate in 1255, that is in his father's life-time, and when he was only 21 1 Assizes, 56 Hen.

He had livery of his Staffordshire inheritance on January 27, 1258, but died without issue in the course of the next year -1 for on Sept. 19, 1259, William brother and heir of Ranulph de Perton did homage and had livery, being then 22 years of age.2 The Writ of Diem clausit on William de Person's death bears date February 4, 1280. One of the subsequent Inquests reported the value of his estate at Perton as \u00a38. 6s. 4\\d. per annum. Another Inquest found him to have held a messuage and 59 acres of land in Strichleg, under the Abbot of Buildwas, at a rent of 32c?. per annum. The value of the estate to the deceased was 20s. per annum. John his son and heir was now 17f years of age.3 A second In quest ordered on July 8, 1283, calls the Stirchley estate a carrucate of land, values it at 40s. per annum, and makes the Abbot's rent to be 3s. per annum. John son and heir of William de Perton was now reported to be more than of full age.4 With this John, who was living at the close of Edward II.'s reign, I quit the subject. STIRCHLEY CHURCH. This was in its original state a Chapel, probably in the Parish of Idsall, and founded by the Manorial Lords of Stirchley in the twelfth century. Its architectural features are alone sufficient to prove this antiquity of foundation. The subjection of Stirchley to IdsaU has long since vanished. How or by whom the Advowson of Stirchley was given to Wen lock Priory I cannot say. We have seen that the Prior's Title thereto was ratified by a Fine in 1238. The Taxation of 1291 values the Church of Stucheley in the Deanery of Newport at \u00a32. 13s. 4d. per annum.5 In 1341 the Assessors of the Ninth taxed the Parish at 40s. There were no sheep here, and a third of the Manor was held in hand by the Abbot of Buildwas, who was not assessable to the current Tax.6 In an Inquest of the year 1379 the Church of Stircheleye is valued at 100s. per annum, and certi fied to be in the gift of Wenlock Priory.7 The Valor of 1534-5 puts John Poynor's gross income as Rector of Stirchley, at \u00a36. 13s. 4d.

Walter, Chaplain of Stirchley, has been seen attesting a Deed about 1220-30, but it is more probable that he was an Officiating Priest than Incumbent of the Church. The Living was vacant in 1238, and probably Robert de Acton, Clerk, was the next Incumbent. It is he who apparently was styled Parson of Stirchley about 1248-9. I have said much of him on former occasions,1 and shall have to recur to his name again. He probably quitted Stirchley for more lucra tive preferment. In 1256 we have had mention of one \u2014 Roger, as then or recently Parson of Stirchley.2 We have also seen the said Roger attest a grant to Wenlock Priory about the middle of the thirteenth century; and we know that he was living in 1272.3 In Easter Term 1283 the Prior of Repiudon charged John Prior of Wenlock and his accomplices, one of whom was \u2014 Richard, Parson of Stirchele, with coming by night to Repindon and seizing goods to the value of 1000 merks. The Defendants appeared not. The Sureties for Parson Richard were Elyas and Roger de Ketley, brothers.4 Roger de Esthop, Rector of Stirchley, resigned January 13, 1310, and on March 1 7 following \u2014 Walter de Perton, Acolyte, son of John de Perton, was insti tuted at the presentation of the Prior and Convent of Wenlock.

The Alien Priory of Wenlock was now in the hands of Edward III. by reason of his war with France : so a Patent of February 25, 1349, presents \u2014 Richard le Bret, Chaplain, to this Living;5 and the Bishop admitted him on March 10 following. Le Bret died on Monday, the day of St. Alban, the Protomartyr of England (June 22, 1349); \u2014 a fitting day for the obit of one who was doubtless a victim of that mighty Pestilence which found an Army of Martyrs in the Clergy of the Anglican Church.

I know nothing more of the Saxon Aisil, or of Earl Roger's im mediate Tenant, Richard, than is related in the above passages. My only reason for identifying the Manor with Brockton near Longford, is that there is no other Brockton within the area of Re cordin Hundred. As to tenure, I know of nothing in the later status of Brockton which can be called analogous to its Domesday condition. And yet there is no positive inconsistency between the two, for I suppose that Brockton escheated to King Henry I. by forfeiture of Ricardus or failure of his heirs ; and that the King al lowed it to be annexed to Longford, so as to make up those 100 solidates of land which he designed to bestow on Hamo de Long ford or his ancestor. Ever since, Brockton has been accounted a mere member of Longford, and as such I have, under Longford, said all that I know of it. mnmrslep. It is fitting that I should now give account of five Manors in Re cordin Hundred, which were part of the Domesday Fief of Gerard de Tornai. The first of these is described as follows. \u2014 \" Gerard holds Chinardeseie of Earl Roger. WUlegrip held it (in Saxon times) . Here is one hide, geldable. The (arable) land is (enough) for mi ox-teams. In demesne is one team, and (there are) in Serfs, nn Villains, and in Boors with two teams. In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 21s. (per annum) ; now it is worth 18s.\"1 Gerard de Tornai probably took his name from the Norman Vill of Toumai-sur-Dive, which was, I think, a member of Earl Roger's Vicomte of the Oximin. I have in a former Volume associated this Baron's forfeiture with the Western rebeUion of 1088. 3 Such a theory is untenable, for Gerard de Tornai was apparently holding his own in the time of Earl Hugh, that is between 1093 and 1098. He follows the Earl 1 Domesdai/, so. 258, b, 2. | 2 Supra, Vol. II. p. 104."], [585, "127 KINNERSLEY. and his own son-in-law, Hamo Peverel, in the attestation of a Charter already recited.1 Even the question of Gerard de Tornai's forfeiture at any time is, I think, a doubtful one. The chief proof thereof is that his estates were, in Henry II.'s time, usually de scribed as the Escheats of Gerard de Tornai. Possibly that term may have implied no more than that Gerard's estates had lapsed to the Crown in default of heirs. Hamo Peverel had certainly enjoyed the bulk of those estates for life, and whether in right of his wife Sibil, daughter of Gerard de Tornai, or as Grantee of Henry I., I cannot determine. Having no issue by the said Sibil, Hamo Peve rel attempted, and indeed contrived, to settle certain Tornai estates on his own, and not his wife's, collateral heirs. The Scheme was ultimately abortive, for Henry II. disallowed such a mode of suc cession, and resumed whatever could be found of these estates into his own hands, the Under-tenants thereof becoming Tenants in capite. Thus much I have said in qualification of a former state ment.2 The Rule, now laid down, did not hold good in respect of such estates as Hamo Peverel had given to Religious Houses. His grants in frank almoign were respected. This remark is very rele vant to tbe history of Kinnersley. The next notice which we have of this place after Domesday, is in one of Earl Hugh's Charters to Shrewsbury Abbey.3 The Char ter is undoubtedly spurious,4 but there is no reason to question one or two of the circumstances which it records. Hamo Peverel, it says, one of the Earl's Barons, and at the Earl's request, gave the tithes of his demesnes to the Abbey. Among the tithes said to be thus given are those of Cleya (read Sleap), of Brugelton (read Crudgington), and of Kinardesey. I suppose that it was only the tithes of Kinnersley that Hamo Peverel really gave on this occasion. It was probably immediately after Henry I.'s death that Hamo Peverel and his wife Sibil gave the fee-simple of these identical estates to the same Abbey. Their grants as described and confirmed in King Stephen's Charter, very early in his reign, I must give in the language of that Confirmation.\u2014 Defuncto autem Rege Henrico, cum venerabilis nepos ejus Ste phanus in regno successit, supradictus Hamo Peurell, concedente Rege, dedit ecclesi\u00e6 Sancti Petri duas mllas, id est Crugeltonam et Sclepam, et Sibilla uxor ejus aliam villam qu\u00e6 vocatur Chinardesia, concedente viro suo et dono (read donum) super altare ponente. 3 Salop Chartulary, No. 5. 1 Supra, Vol. VI. p. 170. 2 Supra, Vol. II. pp. 104-107. 4 Vide supra, Vol. I. p. 33, note."], [586, "128 KINNERSLEY.

This Charter bears in itself a mark of undoubted truth ; for we happen to know that Sleap and Crudgington were members of High Ercall, a Manor which belonged to Hamo Peverel in his own right, while Kinnersley was a Tornai estate. Hence the distinctive way in which each estate was granted. When in the above extract Hamo Peverel is said to have laid his wife's gift upon the Altar, some sign or token of the gift must be understood. In this case the token was probably a written Charter, that namely of which we have a copy in the Abbey Chartulary, and which is briefly as follows. \u2014 Notum sit, fye, quod ego Hamo Peverel et Sibilla conjux mea de dimus, fye, villam qu\u00e6 vocatur Kinardeseia, sicut Gyrardus Tornay, Antecessor noster, et nos postmodum earn melius et liberius tenu imus.

The next Confirmation to Shrewsbury Abbey was that of the Empress Maud, about 1141. Among lands given to the Abbey since her Father's death, it includes the grant of Chinardeseia by Hamo Peverel.3 But a more remarkable confirmation is that of William Peverel of Dover, nephew and heir, or coheir, of Hamo Peverel. Therein he treats of Wollerton and Kinnersley, both Tornai estates, as if they were subject to his arbitration as Hamo Peverel's heir. This Charter passed at Marlborough, probably in the year 1144, when we know that William de Dovre, as he is elsewhere called, was actively promoting the cause of the Empress in Wiltshire and the adjoining Counties.4 \u2014 I give the document as it stands in the Monasticon.5 Willielmus Peverellus de Dowria omnibus fidelibus sanct\u00e6 Dei Ecclesi\u00e6 salutem.

Henry II.'s Confirmation to Shrewsbury Abbey passed in 1155. It shows that he ratified Hamo Pevercl's grants, whether taken out of his own estates or the Fief of Tornai. It confirms the following, viz. ex dono Hamonis Peverel et Sibill\u00e6 uxoris ejus Wlurentonam et Chinardeseiam et Crugeltonam et Sclepam. The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 does not recognize Kin nersley as a distinct Manor, but we know that the hidage which is attributed to the Abbot's Manor of Sleap, viz. 2\\ hides, must have been inclusive of the hide assigned in Domesday to Kinnersley. The Abbot of Shrewsbury's Charter of Free- Warren, dated May 21, 1256, extends to Wlfreton (Woolerton), Slepe, and Kynardes leye.4 The Bradford Tenure-Roll (about 1285) notices the Abbot of Shrewsbury's tenure of the Manor of Slepe, and makes Crugulton (Crudgington), Kynnersley, and Butterley (that is Butterey), to be members thereof. So too in the Taxation of 1291 the estate described as Sclepe must have included Kinnersley and Crudgington, and whatever the Abbot had at Tern. In the Valor of 1534-5 the collective estate is described as Slepe and Croginton, but the Ministers' Accounts of 1541-2 call it the Lordship of \" Slepe, Crogelton, and Kemsey,\" meaning, by the last name, Kinnersley. The various Valuations of the aggregate Manor shall be given on a future page. As to the Undertenants of Shrewsbury Abbey at Kinnersley, I have a few notes. Richard de Momerfield (or Morville) was one of them. He has been mentioned as a witness of a grant to the Abbey about 1250-1255. 5 He married one Agnes, whose mother was Isabella, a daughter of that Gilbert Sadoc who has also oc curred on former pages.6 In 1259 Agnes widow of Richard de Momerfeld mortgages 5 acres of land in Hundrethale, with the meadow belonging thereto, to Hugh le Vileyn, for a term of 12 years ; and if at the end of that term the money advanced by the 1 Probably a Tenant in Wilham Peve rel's Cambridgeshire Fief (Vide Monasti con, II. 601, No. x). 2 Called Brien de Valle de Riul in a former Charter (p. 128).

Witnesses, John de Prestecote, then Provost of the Foriete ; Richard de Pres ton, Clerk ; and David de Montgomery.\"2 It appears from another Record that Richard de Momerfeld had left a son and heir, Oliver. On May 24, 1259, Oliver son of Richard de Momerfeud takes out a Writ against WiUiam le Rusur for disseizing him of a tenement in Kinardesey. Again, at the As sizes of August 1267, Oliver de Momerfeld, as heir of his father, sued Robert de Buldewas as tenant in possession of half a virgate in Kinardeseye. The said Tenant called the Abbot of Shrewsbury to warranty, and the Abbot proved that Richard de Momerfeld had sold the premises, and further, that Oliver had since renounced all claim thereto. This determined the suit in favour of the Abbot and his Tenant. THE CHURCH. Bishop Peche (1161-1182) in his enumeration of tithes belong ing to Shrewsbury Abbey, mentions the whole tithes of the Abbot's demesnes at Wolretone (Wollerton), Slepe, and Kynardeseye. As yet there was no Church at Kinnersley, and I take it that the Manor was in the Parish of Edgmond. In the next century, viz. about 1173-4, we have seen under Longford,3 that there was a Cha pel at Kynnersley, which the then Lord of Longford wrested from the Monks of Shrewsbury. It was afterwards restored by his widow. The Taxation of 1291 values the Church of Kinardeseye (in the Deanery of Salop) at _\u00a3l. 13s. 4c? (per annum), besides a Pension of 2s. which the Abbot of Shrewsbury took therefrom.4 In 1341 the Parish of Kynardesheye is more correctly placed in 1 Salop Chartulary, No. 207. 2 Ibidem, No. 112. 3 Supra, p. 104. 4 Pope Nich.

The reasons for so low an assessment were, because the chief part of the Church-income arose from hay-tithes and oblations; because very little land in the Parish was under the plough; and because a great part of the said Church (read Parish) consisted of woods and marshes. The Abbot of Shrewsbury's Temporalities within the Parish were included in the assessment of one merk.1 The Valor of 1534-5 places Kynnasshey in the Deanery of Newport. WUliam Gol borne, the Rector, had a gross annual income of \u00a36. 13s. 4c?., out of which he paid 6s. 8c?. for Procurations, Is. for Synodals, and a Pension of 4s. to Shrewsbury Abbey.2 EARLY INCUMBENTS. Walkeline de Northampton, Clerk, was presented to the Church of Kinardesey by a Patent of August 18, 1223, the King presenting because of an existing vacancy in the Abbacy of Shrews bury. Hugh Deverous was Rector here in 25 Edw. I. (1296-7) . Thomas, Rector of Kynardeseye, died on June 5, 1321, and on October 13 following, the Bishop instituted \u2014 William de Baggesore, Priest, at presentation of the Abbot and Convent of Shrewsbury. A Patent3 of the year 1343 sanctions an exchange between this Rector and \u2014 William de Gretton, late Vicar of Clifford (Heref. Dioc), who is admitted to Kynardeseye on Nov. 13, 1343. This Rector died August 12, 1349 (probably of the Pestilence), and on Sept. 14 following, the Bishop admitted \u2014 John de Dounton, Acolyte, at the presentation of the Abbot and Convent of Salop. On January 13, 1351, Dounton exchanges preferments with \u2014 Reginald de Chetwynde, Priest, late Rector of Chetwynde.4 On February 15, 1405, The Reverend Father in Christ Sir John Serles, entitled Triburnensius Episcopus, was instituted to Kinnersley on the usual presentation.5 5 He was probably a Papal Nominee. He had resigned the Vicarage of Bas church in 1404. 1 Inquis. Nonarum, p. 193. 2 Valor Ecclesiasticus, III. 188. 3 Patent, 17 Edw.

There is an appearance, but probably a delusive one, that Hugh Earl of Shrewsbury sometime held Shawbury in demesne. He is said, in a somewhat suspicious Charter of Shrewsbury Abbey,3 to have granted two-thirds of his demesne of Saubury to that House. The Monks certainly had these tithes at a later period and by an ancient title. My idea is that the Monks did not themselves know how they obtained these tithes, and that Earl Hugh's Charter was in vented or interpolated to account for this and some other similar ac quisitions. It is clear that Hamo Peverel succeeded to Gerard de Tornai as Lord of Shawbury : and it was probably he who granted tithes thereof to Shrewsbury Abbey. In the reign of Henry I. Hamo Peverel had a Tenant here, viz. that \u2014 Nigel de Saubery, who, with Robert his son, attests two Charters of the said Hamo and his wife Sibil.4 The said Charters passed before the death of Henry I., as will appear under Betton in-Hales and Woolerton, \u2014 the places to which they relate. Nigel de Shawbury's death and the succession of his son and heir, \u2014 Robert fitz Nigel, are indicated by a twofold appearance of the latter as Witness of Hamo Peverel's Deeds, during the first two years of Stephen's reign.5 The next that I hear of Robert fitz Nigel is his grant of Shawbury Church to Haughmond Abbey. 1 There is probably an omission in this passage, viz. of the number of Teams pos sessed by the individuals enumerated. remarks on this Charter, supra, Vol. I. p. 102. 4 Salop Chartulary, Nos. 19, 24.

It is singular that this Confirmation should omit to name the actual Donor of Shawbury Church. That it was Robert fitz Nigel I know from the Confirmation of Bishop Peche (Durdent's Succes sor), whose Charter to Haughmond confirms the following, viz. ex dono Roberti de Sagheberia ecclesiam ejusdem vill\u00e6 cum capellis de Mortone, Actone, et Wideford? I know it also from Robert fitz Nigel's own Charter, which, though it was written some years after the grant, expresses the said grant to be his, and was attested by that very Bishop Peche of whom we are speaking. \u2014 \u2022 As Robert fitz Nigel he gives to the Abbey, \"for the souls' health of himself, his father, mother, and all his friends (parentum), the Advowson of the Church of St. Mary of Schawgesbury.

Guy de Shawbury is a frequent witness of the Charters which passed during his time. His Confirmation of Shawbury Church to Haughmond Abbey is valuable in a genea logical point of view. Styling himself \" Wydo de Scawbery, son of Robert, son of Nigel,\" he gives to the Canons the \" Church of Saubery, which Robert, his father, had previously given.\" He gives also a virgate of land pertaining to the Church, and pannage for 30 swine ; and rights of common, in wood and in pasture ; and tithes of his MiU of Saubery. Moreover he releases all royal dues (omne regale) on half of the aforesaid virgate of the Church, about which there had been some litigation between him and the Canons, and allows that with the other half-virgate it shall be quit of all secular service for ever.

The Pipe-Roll of 1195 gives \u00a33. 10s. as received by the Sheriff on this account. It appears from another Record that Gwido de Shawbury withheld one merk, the whole or part of his Hability in this matter. For this he was amerced 20 merks. For payment of the debt he found six Sureties, two of whom were resident in Buckinghamshire, one in Kent, one in Essex, one in Oxfordshire, and one (Reginald de Time) in Shropshire.2 For the year ending Michaelmas 1197 Wido fitz Robert acted as Under Sheriff to William fitz Alan. At Wido de Shawbury's death, which happened in 1200-1, \u00a31. 13s. 4d. of his amercement of 20 merks remained due. I shall speak presently of its subsequent discharge.

This seems to have included the specific quota of Guy de Shawbury. The same Pipe-Roll of 1199 exhibits him as Wido fitz Robert, and as having fined 2 merks \" not to be compelled to cross the seas.\" Within the next two years he was waylaid and murdered in the Forest of Haughmond. There was much contradictory evidence as to the mode of his death, but I shaU do best to give the Trial of his sup posed Murderer as it stands on the Assize-Roll of October 1203. I should premise that the suspected Murderer was heir apparent of a distinguished family in the neighbourhood, viz. the son of Sir Ralph Husee of Albright- Hussey. \u2014 The judicial Record of this extraordinary case is worded as follows. \u2014 \" William fitz John challenges (appellat) Walter, son of Ralph Hose, for that when his (William's) Lord, Wido de Scage bury, and William himself, were returning from Pleas of the Crown in the Curia Comitatus, held at Shrewsbury, five men came upon them in the Forest of Hageman, and there, in the peace of the King, and feloniously (nequiter) they attacked his Lord, Wido, so that he (Walter), being one of the five, did then and there wound the said Wido, and was with the others aiding and abetting, when Wido, his Lord, was slain. And after he (Walter) had dealt such wound upon his Lord, he came up to the AppeUant, and held him, so that he could not succour bis Lord. And aU this he offers to prove (dirationare) against the Appellee, as the Court shall decide.\" \" And Walter Hose appears in Court and denies every word of the accusation, &c.\" \" The Court determines that the parties should be bound over to a wager of battle ,*'n and a day, the morrow of All Saints (Nov. 3) is given to them at Oxford, and \" thither let them come armed.\" \" And Ralph Hose gives the King half a merk that he may have custody (meantime) of his son Walter, his Sureties (for producing him at Oxford) being John de Cuotton and Reiner de Acton. And the Court commits the accused to the custody (or suretiship) of Ralph Hose, Reiner de Acton, John de Cnotton, Reiner de la Lee, Adam de Mukeleston, William de Bromele, Stephen de Acle, and Eudo de Mere.\" The Assize-Roll contains another, not very inteUigible, entry on this subject. Ralph Hose seems to undertake to produce his son at Worcester on Sunday after St. Luke's day (i.e. on October 19) ; 1 Consideratum est quod duellum sit inter eos vadiatum."], [594, "136 SHAWBURY and the Son is further desirous that a son of Hamo Marescot should attend there.1 The Justices in eyre proceeded from Shrewsbury to Worcester, Hereford, Gloucester, and Oxford, but nothing occurs on the Roll of their proceedings to show why the Duel between William fitz John and Walter Hose was not struck. A Westminster Plea- Roll, of uncertain date, but which I suppose to belong to the year 1204., recurs to the subject, and shows that William fitz John eventually declined the contest. The entry is as foUows. \u2014 \"Walter Hose presented himself on the fourth day against WiUiam fitz John in a plea of Duel, engaged to be fought concern ing the death of Wido de Sauburi. And the said William neither appears, nor essoigns himself; and a day had previously been given him in banco, and since then (a day had been given him) through his Essoignor. Wherefore the Court decides that Walter Hose should depart sine die, and that William fitz John should have such recovery as he ought to have, and that he should be attached to appear in Court and hear (this) judgment.\"2 I have fixed the period of Guy de Shawbury's death as in 1200 or 1201. 3 I had reason for so doing. In the first half of the latter year \" Nigel fitz Robert fined 15 merks that he might have seizin of the land which had belonged to his brother Wido, and for his relief and passage.\"4 The latter expression is equivalent to the ne transfretet of other Fines, and appears to have covered Nigel fitz Robert's liability to the second scutage of King John : for the Sheriff accounts 4 merks and 8 pence for this year's scutage of the Fief of Tornai, specially noting that one knight's-fee, viz. Nigel fitz Robert's, was not assessed.5 Nigel fitz Robert appears again in 1202, on the third Scutage of King John. Six merks and 8c.. formed the coUective assess ment of \" the fees of Gerard de Tornay and the fee of Nigel fitz Robert.\" The latter had clearly paid his quota of 2 merks, for the small arrear of 8d. is all that is certified to be due on the whole 1 Salop Assizes, 5 John, mm. 3, 5. 2 Placita Roll, No. 7, m. 4 dorso. either that' the Sheriffs' Accounts are oc casionally more retrospective than they ap pear superficially, or else, that the name of a deceased person was used, when his Executor or some one else really ac counted on his behalf. 4 Oblata, p. 170. 5 Rot.

Before Michaelmas 1203 Nigel fitz Robert was de ceased, and apparently without issue, for a third brother, viz., Richer de Shawbury or Richer fitz Robert now succeeded to the estates of the family. The Pipe-Roll of 1203 exhibits Richer de Sagbir as covering his assessment to the fourth Scutage of King John by a Fine of 5 merks, the ordinary rate being 2 merks per fee. The same Roll shows Leticia, widow of Wido de Shawbury, fining 5 merks that she might be allowed to marry whom she would. At the Assizes of October 1203 (the very Assizes at which her husband's murder was investigated), \"Leticia, widow of Guido,\" was suing Richer fitz Robert for disseizing her of a tenement in Schauberi. He had to pay half a merk damages, and an amercement of double the sum. His sureties were John and Richard de Withyford, Richard de Chesthull, and Baldwin Wischard.1 Richer de Shawbury's Fine for Relief was 10 merks. It does not appear on the Rolls till the Summer of 1204, and then it appears as if he fined as immediate successor of Wido de Shawbury, whose heir he asserted himself to be.3 In the same year he paid a Fine of 6 merks in discharge of his liability to the fifth scutage of King John. To the sixth scutage, levied in 1205, Richer de Shaubury's assessment was the ordinary quota for a knight's-fee, viz. 2 merks. It seems to have been paid at once. Before September 1206 Richer de Shawbury had suffered out lawry and forfeiture for the murder of Maurice de Shawbury. This does not appear directly from any cotemporary Record, but the fact is clear from later evidences, and its date is proved by the Scutage- Roll of 1206. King John's seventh Scutage was at the rate of 20s. per fee. Richer de Shawbury was neither assessed nor exempted ; but\u2014 Thomas de Erdinton answers for a charge of 20s. ; \u2014 and this must have been for Shawbury. This powerful favourite of King John was now holding office as Custos or Sheriff of the two Coun ties of Shropshire and Staffordshire. The Charter or other special Instrument by which the King invested him with Shawbury is not I bebeve extant.3 A Tenure-Roll of the \" Escheats of Gerard de Thurnay,\" drawn up I think about the year 1212, has the following 1 Assizes, 5 John, m. 4. and Wellington to Thomas de Erdington in 1211 or 1212. Such a Charter, as re gards Shawbury at least, must have been ex post facto, or confirmatory of a previ ous gift. 2 Rot. Finium, p. 211. 3 Dugdale (Baronage, II. Ill) quotes a Chartulary or Charter, whereby King John would seem to have granted Shawbury 18 VIII."], [596, "138 SHAWBURY. entry. \u2014 \" Thomas de Erdinton holds Sachcbur of the gift of King John, and owes the service of one knight.\"1 The course of Erdington's dealings with Shawbury is briefly but not quite accurately sketched in a retrospective presentment of the Bradford Jurors at the Assizes of 1221.\u2014 \"The Vill of Shaubir' was an Escheat of the Lord King ; and King John gave it to Thomas de Erdinton, and Thomas gave it to his son Peter, who demised it for a term to Henry de Audley. It is worth 100s. (per annum).\" It will be sufficient to state here, in explanation of this account, that there was at least an intention on the part of Thomas de Erdington to make over Shawbury to his eldest son Peter. Peter died without issue, while on a Crusade, and was succeeded by his brother Egi dius. Both Peter and Egidius had in turn some transactions about Shawbury with Henry de Audley ; and Audley was seized of the Manor for a number of years. The nature and legality of these trans actions were afterwards questioned, with what result we shall in due course see. Thomas de Erdinton, it will be remembered, died on March 20, 1218, having been shorn a Monk.2 It is not difficult to determine what Crusade of this period must have been the one in which his eldest son, Peter, perished. The year 1218 is the date given by Matthew Paris for the departure of the Earls of Chester, Arundel, and Winchester on that expedition which, in November of the year following, resulted in the capture of Damieta. That Egidius or Giles de Erdinton was in minority at the time of his father's and brother's deaths there cannot be a doubt. We will however follow the course of events in the order of their occurrence. On June 25, 1218, \" Richer de Shagebury fined 5 merks to have pardon for his flight, and repeal of his outlawry, for the murder of Maurice de Shagebury.\" The Sheriff of Salop having taken secu rity for the Fine, was ordered to give him the King's letters patent of pardon.3 The Writ containing such order was tested by the Earl Marshal; but on July 8, 1222, Richer de Saghebiri fined 40s. for letters under the King's own Seal, similar to those which he had under Seal of the Earl Marshal during the King's minority. This Fine is entered on the Roll as belonging to Buckinghamshire.4 Whatever was its effect, it worked no restitution for the Outlaw, in respect of his Shropshire estate. On May 1, 1224, the King enjoins the Sheriff of Shropshire that 1 Testa de Nevill, p. 56, b. 2 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 250. I 3 Rot.

Shortly after this, Giles de Erdinton appears with at least an asserted interest in Shawbury. A Writ of May 30, 1225, ap points him a day (viz. the octaves of Trinity Sunday) to appear before the King, wherever the Court may be, to have or produce his warranty of the land which he holds of the King in Sauebiry.2 At this time then Giles de Erdinton's claim to Shawbury was only pro blematical. Henry III.'s confirmation of the various acquisitions made by his faithful Servant, Henry de Audley, bears date, May 2, 1227. Inter alia it confirms the following, viz. \"Of the gift of Egidius de Erdington the whole Manor of Schagebury with all its appurtenances.\"3 On October 13, 1227, a Fine was levied whereby Roysia de Cokerfeld (Plaintiff) releases for 20 merks to Henry de Audley, all the right which she had in the name of dower to one-third of the Manors of Saghebir', Besseford, and Parva Wytheford. Roese de Cokefield was, I should explain, widow of Thomas de Erdington. I think it was in Michaelmas Term 1236, that Giles de Erdinton first made an open move to recover Shawbury from Audley. He adopted the process of mort d'ancestre, the main specific question being \" whether his Father Thomas had died seized of one carucate and 12 virgates in Shagebiry, whereof Henry de Audithley was now holding 1 carucate and 2 virgates, and Bertram Griffin was holding 10 virgates.\" At the day of Trial both the said Tenants appeared in Court at Westminster, but Bertram Griffin called his Co-defend ant and Feoffor to warranty. Audley vouchsafed such warranty and took upon himself the whole defence. His Plea was that no Assize ought to be taken in this case, because Giles de Erdinton himself had enfeoffed him in the whole premises by a Charter which he now produced. The Charter was read in Court. It contained words to the effect that \" Giles gave and conceded and confirmed the whole Manor of Shaghebiry, to Audley, with aU such advantages and cir cumstances as Thomas, the Grantor's Father, held it of King John ; to hold to Audley by performing the service of one knight, with all forinsec services.\" Audley further deposed that \" Giles de Erdinton had accepted his homage for Shawbury, and that since the sealing of the above Charter he had performed the specified service to Er dinton ; that is, when the King had levied a scutage throughout 1 \u25a0 2 Rot.

England, he, Audley, had paid 40s. of such scutage to one William Fadir, a servant of Erdinton's, at Wellington.\"1 To aU this Erdinton replied as follows : \u2014 \" That when he executed the above Charter to Audley, he was under age, and had no seizin of his lands ; \u2014 also that when he accepted Audley's homage he was a Minor. As to receiving the aforesaid service (the scutage of 40s.) he denied it altogether. He offered the King a Fine of 20s. that the truth of his assertions might be tested by Inquisition.\" Audley rejoined, affirming that \"Erdinton was of full age when he executed the Charter. This he offered to prove by wager of battle, and named one Henry Pigun as his Champion.\" A day (January 27, 1237) was given to both parties to appear and hear judgment at Westminster. Erdinton named WiUiam de Erdinton (his Uncle, I think) his Attorney, or else Robert de Brumwic. On January 20th, 1237, Audley essoigned his attendance in a plea de audiendo judicio, against Giles de Erdinton. His Essoignor was Robert de Hasewic or Hanwis. The case was adjourned to the Quinzaine of Easter. On that day I presume (viz. May 3, 1237) a further day, viz. the octaves of Trinity (June 21, 1237), was given, in their suit of mort d'ancestre, to Erdinton and Audley. The Knights and others, who were to take the Inquest above alluded to, were to attend at Westminster, and report their findings on two issues, viz. as to Erdinton's age when he executed the above Deed, and, as to his receipt of 40s. scutage, as alleged by Audley. The names of Richard de Middelhope, Robert de Stapleton, Henry de Preme (Qy. Prene?2), Nicholas de Wililey, and John de Beckbury were specified as being on the Inquest. Somehow the matter was transferred from Westminster to the hearing of the King himself. At Worcester, on October 15, 1237, the foUowing Jury attended before the King, viz. Richard de Mid delhop, William fitz Aer, Peter de Dudmaston, Richard de Leigh ton, Hugh de Upton, Peter de Eyton, Geoffrey de Overton, Robert de Haughton, Thomas de Constantine, Simon de Haubercheyn, Robert de Gyrros, Adam de Beysin, and Ingelard de Acton. Their names are important as showing what a weighty matter this had become, for they were representatives of the chief knightly families in the County, and had been empanelled by consent of both Liti- 1 The allusion must be either to the Scutage of Brittany in 1230, or that of Poitou in 1231. Both were at the rate of 3 merks or 40*. per fee. It is remark able however that neither Giles de Erdiu- ton nor any other supposable Lord of Shawbury had been assessed to any Scu tage since Thomas de Erdinton's assess ment in 1206 (supra, p. 137). 2 Compare Vol. YI. p. 81, note 6."], [599, "SHAWBURY. 141 gants. The questions put to these Jurors were substantively what we have been led to expect by the preliminaries, except that Erdin ton's Charter is described as conveying a carucate and 12 acres (not virgates) to Audley ; and except that the scutage referred to is specified as that which followed the King's return from Brittany, by which we must understand the scutage technically known as that of Poitou, in 1231. The Jurors' answers are very curious and in structive. They said that \" after the death (they meant the out lawry) of Richer de Shagebury, who had held the land in question, and who had suffered forfeiture, Thomas de Erdinton, then Sheriff, seized it into the King's hand, and held it till the King, John, gave it to the said Thomas pro homagio. Then Thomas promised the land to his son Peter, and actually gave it to him before he (Tho mas) died ; and Peter had sometime actual possession thereof, but whether this was before or after his father's death the Jurors could not determine. Afterwards Peter caused himself to be signed with the cross, but before he set out for the Holy Land, he demised (tra didit) the land to Henry de Audley, to farm for a certain term. Peter died during the Crusade. Afterwards Giles, Peter's brother, went and received Audley's homage, and the Jurors were fully as sured that, at the moment, Giles was under 21 years of age. This they knew from a circumstance (given), viz. that, after the said act of homage, Giles, being called to warranty by one WUliam de Norfolk (who was unpleaded for certain lands held under Giles), appeared before the Justiciars de Banco in the Curia Regis, but was found to be under age, so that the said suit had been a remanet till Giles did actually come of age.\" Further the Jurors plainly declared (bene dicunt) that \"they could not comprehend how Erdinton's servant could have received 40s. scutage from Audley, as alleged ; for that Audley had personally served in the expedition in question,1 and had had, as they believed, the usual letters of scutage.\" As to whether Erdinton was seized of his other lands (and so was ostensibly if not actually of age) when he received Audley's homage, the Jurors knew not. Here the cause seems to have been adjourned. On a subsequent occasion the Jurors were summoned to reappear on June 6, 1238 ; because they had not clearly stated (nil certum dicunt) whether Peter had had actual possession (posuit se in terra) before or after his father's death. 1 We have had categorical proof of this (Vol. VII. p. 184)."], [600, "142 SHAWBURY. It was not however till July 1, 1239, that the Jurors were again got together. They then certified on oath that Peter de Erdinton had had no seizin during his father's life, but that Thomas had died seized of the premises.1 The judgment now given remains as a testimony of the majesty of the law, even when administered by so weak a monarch as Henry III. and in the case of a favourite like Audley. \u2014 Consideratum est quod Egidius recuperat seisinam suam, et Henricus in misericordid. During the course of this Trial, Roger de Harpecot and Bertram Griffin had appeared in Court and declared that they staked no thing on the findings of the above Jurors. The former held Char ters entitling him to the receipt of 7s. rent in Preston,2 which was a sub-tenure involved in the disputed premises. The latter held a virgate of land and the abntment of a stank, in a simUar ratio.3 A Tenure-Roll of the year 1240 is a useful supplement to the above proceedings. It gives Egidius de Erdinton as Tenant in capite of a knight's-fee in Schagebury.4 One advantage seems to have resulted to Giles de Erdington from the length of time during which the status of Shawbury had been doubtful. The Manor had been omitted in the Scutage-Rolls ; and the Officers of the Exchequer seem never to have thought of renewing its undoubted liability to such assessments. On February 29, 1244, Giles de Erdinton obtained the King's Charter of Free-Warren in Schawebury and in Besford, then re puted to be a member of Shawbury. The Charter further allowed him to hold a weekly Market on Thursdays in his Manor of Wel lington ; and also a yearly Fair of three days' duration, viz. the vigil, the day, and the morrow of St. Barnabas (June 10, 11, and 12).5 The Bradford Hundred-Roll6 of 1255 describes Shawbury as fol lows. \u2014 \" Giles de Erdinton holds Chabur' with its appurtenances, viz. two hides, by doing for the King the service of one knight, in 1 This proves that Peter de Erdinton's demise to Audley must have been between March 20, 1218 (the day of his Father's death) and November of the same year (when Peter must have left England for Palestine). His object was doubtless to raise a sum of money for his immediate which they properly belonged, and embo died in two membranes of a Coram Rege Roll (numbered \" 45 \" in the present offi cial catalogue). The order however in which the different processes are recited on these two membranes is not that in which they occurred. I have restored the real order in the text, guided partly by duplicate and dated entries on the Placita Rolls, and partly by internal evidence. 4 Testa de Nevill, p. 45. 6 Rot. Chart. 28 Hen.

He has free-warren and a Park in Sauburi, by the King's gift and by Charter, since the last iter of the Justices at Salop, seven years ago.1 Now this Manor was given by King John to Sir Thomas de Herdinton, father of the said Giles, as freely as the^King himself held it.\" When Shawbury is thus estimated to contain two hides, it must be taken to include half Little Withyford. Such a supposition would be an exact reproduction of the Domesday estimate, which gives 1^ hides to Shawbury and half a hide to the now annexed share of Little Withyford.3 What part Giles de Erdington may have taken in the CivU War of 1264-5 I do not know. The innumerable occasions on which he was put in commission as a Justice of Assize, or to try special causes, indicate an active and experienced Jurist. These commis sions begin in 1250 and extend continuously tUl 1262. In 1263 and 1264 he was not thus employed, in Shropshire at least; but in 1265 his judicial services were put in requisition both by the Barons during the King's captivity, and by the King himself after his restoration. He was similarly employed till the middle of 1268.3 From all this I judge that a feud which he had with that noted Royalist, James de Audley, was personal rather than political. On January 20, 1266, Giles de Erdinton appeared before the King at Northampton, to prosecute a suit of trespass. Audley was accused of seizing corn and hay in Erdinton's lands at Shawbury and Bes ford, of arresting Erdinton's servant and carrying him off to Red Castle, of breaking the fence of Shawbury Park and the stank of Besford Vivary. James de Audley had already made several de faults in appearing to the charge. He was still absent, and the suit was pending in Hilary Term 1267, when Withyford is men tioned as one of Erdinton's pillaged estates, and WiUiam Burgylun and Robert de Wykeshal were impleaded as associates and instru ments of Audley. After this I hear no more of it. Perhaps this is owing to Erdington's death, which must have taken place be tween June 1268 and March 1269. On March 15, 1269, the King orders that the Executors of Giles de Erdinton, \"lately deceased,\" cise of the privileges which it conveyed. 2 Supra, pp. 71, 72. 1 The allusion is to Roger de Thurkel by's Iter in November 1248.

In November 1269 and September 1272, \u2014 Henry de Erdington, son and heir of GUes, occurs as in pos session of his estates.1 In October 1272, Henry Gaithare acknow ledges himself to have released to Henry de Erdington a rent of 3s., which the said Henry and his heirs were bound to pay for a tene ment in Osbernesmore and Polecroft.2 Concerning Henry de Er dington I have little to add to what has been said elsewhere con cerning both him and his family.3 He was a Benefactor to Shaw bury Church, long before impoverished by its Impropriators, the Canons of Haghmon. \u2014 As Henry de Erdinton, Knight, he gave to God and to St. Mary, for the sustenance of the Chaplain who should be celebrating divine services in the Church of St. Mary of Shawbury, in pure almoign and for the souls' health of himself, his ancestors, and successors, \u2014 he gave a messuage and curtilage which Robert the Miller had formerly held under him, together with one meadow, and a virgate of land, whereof 7 acres lay upon Crokeforlonge, towards Toret (Qy. Moreton Toret ?) ; and 9 acres lay between the Abbot of Lilleshall's land of Cherleton, and Cresse wal-broke. Witnesses, Sir John de Ercalewe, Sir John fitz Aer, and Sir Robert Corbet of Moreton, Knights.4 Henry de Erdinton, Lord of Shawbury, quitclaimed to the Canons of LilleshaU aU right of common which he had in their Grange at Cherleton. Witnesses, Sir Roger (read Robert) Corbet; Roger Tyrel, John fitz Aer, John de Erkelowe, knights ; and Hugh de Bo linghall.5 Henry de Erdinton died in 1282, when the Sheriffs of Shropshire and Warwickshire were ordered to seize his lands into the King's hand.6 Matilda de Erdinton, widow of Henry, had Shawbury in dower. She was daughter and coheir of Nichola d'Albini by her husband, Roger de Someri of Dudley ; and the said Nichola was one of the Coheiresses of the Albinis Earls of Arundel. The Bradford Tenure- Roll (about 1285) speaks as follows of Shawbury. \u2014 \"Matilda widow of Henry de Erdynton holds the Manor of Schawbere with its members, viz. half Little Withyford as her dower ; and she ought to hold of the King, in capite sine medio, by service of one Knight's-fee : and the said Manor was given by King 1 Rot.

And she (Matilda) holds her free court twice a year in the said Manor. And Roger Pride, a Burgess of Shrewsbury, holds the vill of Besford of the aforesaid Matilda.\" At the Assizes of 1292 the Bradford Jurors represented Egidius de Shawbury as exercising free- warren in Shawbury. This must have been a mere mistake ; for Matilda de Erdinton was stUl living and John de Bifield was her second husband. Her son and heir was \u2014 Henry de Erdington (IL), who coming of age in 1295, had Uvery of his Father's lands, and who succeeded to his Mother's estates in 1302. The said Henry is entered as Lord of Shawbury in the Nomina Villarum of 1316. For further particulars of him and his descendants I refer else where.1 Of Undertenants in this Manor I have hardly any notices, which do not appear elsewhere. Besford too, though accounted a member of Shawbury, wiU hereafter be treated as originally a sepa rate Manor. It appears that Robert Corbet of Moreton, who died in 1300, had been, jointly with his wife Matilda, enfeoffed, not only in Besford but in something at Shawbury. Their Feoffor in each case was Roger Pride, but the Record which I quote is too defaced to yield further information.2 Again, in the time of Edward II. (1307-1327), Henry de Erding ton conveyed 3 messuages, 2 miUs, a carucate and half virgate of land in Shawbury and Withyford to Robert de Staunton. This was without license of the Crown, and in 1328 John de Withes or d, son and heir to Robert de Staunton, was questioned as to his tenant right. An Inquest which sat at Newport on March 4, 1329, valued the messuages at 3s. 4c?., the Mills at \u00a31. 6s. 8c?. and the land at \u00a31. 6s. 8d. per annum, and found that the Crown would suffer no injury if these \" parcels of the Manor of Shawbury \" were suffered to remain with John de Witheford and his heirs, they rendering due services. The Manor of Shawbury, worth 100s. per annum, would still remain with Henry de Erdington.3 2 Inquisitions, 29 Edw. I., No. 45. 1 Dugdale's Baronage, II. 112. Dug dale's Warwickshire, pp. 889-891.

That this was a Saxon foundation, we conclude from the mention of a Church and a Priest in the Domesday notice of the Manor. It included in its Parish the afterwards distinct Chapelries of Acton Reynald, Moreton Corbet, Grinsill, and Great Withyford ; and, in each of these vills, Chapels and Cemeteries were founded, in the reign of Stephen or Henry II. , by the Lords of the respective fees. We have a very remarkable certificate of Bishop Roger de Clinton (1130-1148) showing that he himseU remembered the time when three of these Manors were without Chapels, and that he himself had consecrated them. His object however was by this certificate to guard the rights of the Mother Church, and he specially records that such lands and increased endowment (adcrementum) , as the Lords of the Fees had offered, when he consecrated the new Ceme teries, were offered to the Mother Church. It will be observed how exactly Bishop Clinton's views on these matters coincided with those of the cotemporary Bishop of Hereford, in the parallel case of Mor viUe and its Chapels. Other remarks as to the time and causes of these great parochial changes I refer to, rather than reiterate.1 Bishop Clinton's Certificate I must give as I find it. \u2014 Rogerus, Dei gratia Episcopus Cestri\u00e6, omnibus filiis Sanct\u00e6 Ecclesi\u00e6, salutem.

This Charter has been already quoted under Condover and Lee Botwood,4 and been assigned to a late period in Bishop Peche's Episcopacy.

About the middle of the same century there was an agreement between the Abbot of Haughmond and the Vicar of Shawbury of the one part, and Sir Giles de Erdinton of the other part. Sir Giles gives the Church and a virgate of land to the Vicar, for the time being, as Wido de Shawbury had given the same. He also allowed the Vicar pannage for 30 swine, and common pasture for 6 oxen in the bosc of Hemmerleg and The Heymore. The Abbot quitclaimed all right in the latter. Witnesses, Sir Thomas Corbet (of Caus I presume), Robert his brother, Thomas de Rossall. All this time the Abbot of Shrewsbury had been entitled to two thirds of the tithes of Shawbury demesne-lands. The origin of this right was perhaps not definitely known, even to the Monks them selves,2 but analogy teaches us that it must have been by grant of one of the early Lords of the Manor. *We have here then an in stance of that power which the Normans undoubtedly exercised on their first arrival, viz. of alienating the tithes, or parts of the tithes, of a Saxon Parish Church, and bestowing them arbitrarily on some Norman Foundation.3 The earliest Episcopal Confirmation,4 which treats fully and exhaustively of the tithes due to Shrewsbury Abbey 3 Vide supra, Vol. VI. pp. 278, 279. 4 Salop Chartulary, No. 329. 1 Harl.

It mentions distinctly \"two parts of the tithes of the demesnes of Saubury\" as due to the Abbey ; and it mentions them in such a sequence as would incline me to think that they had been originally granted by Hamo Peverel. About the middle of the thirteenth century the Abbot of Shrews bury executed a perpetual lease of these tithes of Shawbury, and of other tithes, to the Abbot of Haughmond. \u2014 He conceded, viz. two thirds of the great and small tithes of all demesnes of Shawbury, which he had from time immemorial, and other tithes at Gulidon ; \u2014 to hold to the Abbot of Haughmond in perpetual farm and for an annual rent of 17s. 4d. Witnesses, Sir Ranulph Pain then Of ficial of Salop, Master Alan Cox, Master Alan Corbet, and Master Richard de Kagworthe.1 Sir Henry de Erdington's grant to Shawbury Church has been already cited.2 It passed about 1272-82, and must be taken as an augmentation of the Vicarage. On June 4, 1290, Adam Schappe, Priest, quitclaimed to the Church of Shawbury all right to half a virgate which \" Henry de Erdinton, formerly Lord of Shawbury,\" gave to the aforesaid Church \" towards the maintenance of one Chaplain, celebrating divine ser vices in the same Church.\" Witnesses, Roger de Preston, Jevon de Mocleton, William Horde, and WUliam Crasset. The Taxation of 1291 values the Church of Schawebur', in Salop Deanery, at \u00a36. 13s. 4c?. per annum? This was the Rectory. The Assessors of the Ninth, in 1341, quoted this Taxation, but reduced the parochial tax to \u00a36. They said that the Church was rather highly taxed (satis alte taxata), and that the Glebe and hay-tithes (not now computable) constituted 13s. 4c?. of the Taxation.4 The Abbot of Haughmond, be it observed, was head of the Commis sioners on whose information the Assessors decided the amount of these assessments. Hence probably the unusual remark about the Church-Taxation being high. In the Valor of 1534-5, Leonard Pontesby, Vicar of Shawbury, is set down as having a gross income of \u00a37. 10s. per annum, charge able with 2s. for Synodals, and 6s. 8d. for Procurations. The Ab bot of Haughmond received \u00a38. 6s. 8c?. for the ferm of Shawbery Rectory.5 I find no notice of any set-off or charge on this item, as paid to or received by the Abbot of Shrewsbury.

Robert, Priest op Shawbury, who occurs late in the twelfth century,1 may have been last Rector or first Vicar.

Richard, Vicar of Shawbury, died Sept. 3, 1322, and on Oct. 21 following, \u2014 Robert de Egelton, Priest, was admitted at presentation of the Abbot and Convent of Haghmon. On July 28, 1336, certain disputes between the said Abbot and Sir Robert, perpetual Vicar of Shawbury, were settled. It was agreed that the Vicar should have for life aU heriots pertaining to the Church, and tithes of all gardens cultivated by the spade, but the Abbot was to have the tithes of all gardens, and the hay-tithes of Welmedowe, at Cherleton, and of all meadows hereafter enclosed. Hugh Parrok was Vicar in 1359 and died in 1367, when, on Oct. 5, the Bishop instituted \u2014 Robert de Haston, Priest, at the presentation of Haughmond Abbey. Sir William Lopinton occurs as Vicar from 1415 to 1427, when he died. Bpptnsttm. \"The same Gerard holds Opetone. Goduin held it (in Saxon times). Here are n hides, geldable.

Among these estates was Uppington. 1 Supra, p. 134. 2 Domesday, so. 258, b, 2."], [614, "152 UPPINGTON. Among the vills which Hamo Peverel gave to Shrewsbury Abbey was Crudgington, a member of High Ercall. It was not therefore a Tornai estate, but was held in capite by Hamo Peverel, in his own, not in his wife's right. Hamo Peverel, whde yet living, destined WUliam Peverel (his nephew) and Walcheline Maminot to be his heirs. He died about 1138, and these youths, acting in concert, seized on all his estates, whether held in his own or his wife's right. Walcheline Maminot, evidently aware of the unsoundness of his title to Uppington, and depending rather on his right to Crudg ington, had it not passed to Shrewsbury Abbey, negotiated an ex change with the Monks. In short he gave them Uppington for Crudgington, as the following curious and coeval memorandum cer tifies. \u2014 Notum sit fye. quod Hamo Peverel dedit Abbati\u00e6 villam qu\u00e6 dicitur Crucheltuna, sicut ipse earn de Rege tenebat, Walchelino et Wil lielmo Peverel concedentibus.

The Empress Maud saw nothing objectionable in an exchange which was negotiated by one, and approved by another, of her most resolute Partisans. In her Confirmation of 1141 to Shrewsbury Abbey she says, \u2014 Lecangium vero quod Monachi et Walchelinus Maminot fecerunt de Crugeltona pro Optund, concedente Willielmo Peverel, confirmo, et pr\u00e6cipio ut firmum sit et stabile? It is next observable that Henry II.'s Confirmation of 1155, though it concedes to the Monks of Shrewsbury whatever had been reason ably given to them since Henry I.'s death, and though it is attested by WalcheUne Maminoth himself, does not mention, much less sanction, the above exchange. 1 Sui excangium ad valens, that is an I 2 Salop Chartulary, No. 28. equivalent, of, or in, his own fief. 3 Ibidem, No. 40."], [615, "153 UPPINGTON. This silence has its meaning, and I venture in this instance, with confidence, to supply the want of positive evidence by something of conjecture. I know for certain that King Henry II. ignored the claims of Hamo Peverel's heirs to the estates of Sibil de Tornai. Consequently I assume that neither Walcheline Maminot, nor the representatives of William Peverel (Hamo's now deceased Nephew), could warrant the above exchange to Shrewsbury Abbey. The next step is not a conjecture but a fact, viz. that the Abbey recovered Crudgington, and that Uppington lapsed to the Crown, like other Tornai Escheats, from failure of any right heir of Gerard de Tornai. To show what Henry II. eventually did with Uppington, I must trace the career of one who may be considered as the type of a class. From the employments and services of \u2014 Roger Mussun we gather what kind of character and person was ordinarUy selected by our early Kings as a Tenant by Serjeantry. The Shropshire Pipe-Roll of 1162 introduces Roger Mushunte as a Landholder in the County and as favoured by the King. He is excused by Writ Royal his quota (4s.) of the Danegeld then levied, but what was his specific estate at that period we do not know. In 1166 the Sheriff of Shropshire had paid 20s. in the Livery or main tenance of Roger Mussun who had been employed in convoying horses, \u2014 doubtless those horses which had been purchased from the stud of Gervase Goch for the King's use, and sent to Normandy.1 Again in 1173 the Sheriff had paid \u00a32. 13s. 4d. to Roger Muissun, towards conveying the King's horses over sea, and by the King's direction. About June 1175 Roger Mussun was appointed Fermor of the Staffordshire Manor of Mere, then in the King's hand. At Mi chaelmas he rendered account at the Exchequer of 40s., being a quarter's ferm of the said Manor. He also accounted 40s. more for certain receipts from Trentham. In this same year, as I sup pose, Roger Musson attests two Confirmations of William fitz Alan (II.) to Buildwas Abbey. And it was doubtless in this or the fol lowing year that the King, visiting Shropshire, rewarded Roger Mussun's services by that grant of lands which I have before aUuded to,2 and which I now set forth verbatim.\u2014 Henricus Rex Angli\u00e6 et Dux Normanni\u00e6 et Aquitani\u0153 et Comes Andegavi\u00e6, Archiepiscopis, Episcopis, fye, salutem.

The relevance of fixing Roger Mussun's service for Uppington and Harrington as a Sore Sparrow-Hawk, will be evident when we consider that Uppington was near the hawk-eyries of Mount Gil bert. At Michaelmas 1177 he accounts at the Exchequer for a sum of \u00a32. 3s. lie?., which he had received for pannage of the King's Forests in Shropshire. In 1185 he and Robert de Broc had acted as Justices of the Forest and had held Pleas in Shrop shire. In 1188 he accounted at the Exchequer for \u00a32. 4s. 5c?., received for pannage of the Shropshire Forests, and in 1189 he ac counted for \u00a34. 4s. 4d. received in like manner. All this time he had been Fermor of Mere (in Staffordshire), accounting regularly \u00a38 per annum at the Exchequer. The Pipe-Roll of 1190 exhibits no renewal of former trusts, but proves that Roger Mussun must have fallen under the displeasure of King Richard. He had fined, and had paid, a sum of 15 merks for the King's goodwill, \u2014 pro habendd benevolentid Regis. His disgrace and his death will have followed hard on one another, for before Michaelmas 1191, \u2014 Galiena widow of Roger Mussun, had fined 100s. with the Chancellor (Longchamp) for license to marry her daughters to whom she pleased. She had paid 40s. and owed 60s. of the sum. But before I proceed with any account of Roger Musaairfs suc cessors I should notice his two grants to Wombridge Priory, \u2014 grants which gave the Canons such power in Uppington, that they rested not till they had acquired the bulk of the Manor. \" For the souls' -health of his Lord King Henry the Second, and himself and his wife,\" Roger Mussun gave to the said Priory \" the 1 Osbert de Camera left England in August 1176 with other persons who were to escort the Princess Johanna to Sicily.

Of the Legend, only the letters Rog'i Mussun were apparent in the year 1346, when the seal was acci dentally broken.4 Galiena Mussun, to whom I now return, paid successive in stalments of her Fine with the Chancellor, till in 1194 the whole was discharged. It does not appear however that this Fine was considered sufficient. On King Richard's return from captivity, she fined 5 merks more, \"for having possession of 100 solidates of land in Oppinton and Addinton (Harrington) and Wutton and Hulle,6 and for marrying her- nine daughters, in which behalf she 1 A strange expression ; but meaning probably that the Chapel was endowed out of the Grantor's demesne. 2 Chartulary (ut supra), No. ccxiij.

The fracture of the Seal, by accident, occasioned a Notary Public, then present, to be employed in drawing up a certificate of the disaster, and of what the seal had been. The Wombridge Ca nons embodied this Certificate in their Chartulary. The whole affair is curious, and important, \u2014 as showing how essential to the validity of a document was the pre servation of its seal. Probably Roger Mussun's device was a hawk. Such a bird would hardly be distinguishable from a sparrow on a Seal ofthe 12th century. 6 By \" Wuttun and Hulle\" I under stand an estate which Roger Mnssim had held at Hill Wotton in Warwickshire.

I have noticed Galiena Mussun's grant to Wombridge Priory, under Harrington.1 It probably passed about 1195. Two of the witnesses (Richard de ChesthuU and Alexander de Novo Burgo) were her sous-in-law, which proves that she had taken partial advantage of her first fine with the Chancellor. I have shown under Bourton that a third son-in-law, Roger Boschart, died about Easter 1194, leaving two infant daughters.2 He then, it is probable, had been married, at least as early as 1191. No story of feudal coheirship can be more intricate than that of the descent of Roger Mussun's nine daughters. Though it is illus trated by evidences of great numerical fuUness, the facts are not always clear. This arises partly from the inaccuracies of the Wom bridge Chartulary which contains about 200 instruments relating to the grants and acquisitions which the Canons obtained at Uppington from the said coheiresses, their husbands, their descendants, or their tenants. Another difficulty is that two of the Ladies are occasion ally described by different names. Thus Isolda Mussun is some times called Cecilia, and one of the other eight daughters is some times called Meidus or Madousa, as well as by her ordinary name. As every daughter of Roger Mussun became necessarily a Tenant in-capite, a number of authentic Records treat of their descendants. To give the Monastic and these latter documents in extenso, would fill a Volume. I cannot hope even to epitomize the subject in any reasonable manner, unless my Readers will give me credit for a diligent study, of which I narrate merely the results. I will first quote such documents as bear upon this descent as a whole, and then give some distinct account of each of the nine Co heiresses and their descendants. Some tabular pedigrees wUl fur ther elucidate the subject. In 1211 it is recorded that Hugh de Beckbury, Alexander Fisher (Piscator), Richard de Brug, Robert de Losford, William de Long ner, Adam de Cherlton, Richard de ChesthuU, William Mareschall and Walter de Beckbury, were Tenants in capite by Serjeantry and owed the King yearly one sore hawk.3 Now six of these were the first husbands, and three were the second husbands of Roger Mussun's nine daughters. In 1255 the Bradford Hundred-Roll tells us precisely how the 1 Supra, Vol. II. p. 133, note 98.

The Sore Hawk payable to the King by the nine Coparceners was stated to be due on the feast of St. Peter ad vincula (August 1). The Manor did suit neither to Comity nor Hundred, and was not geldable. The nine shares of the Manor I wUl take in the order suggested by the Record of 1211, not as they stand in the Hundred-Roll. 1. Philip son of John de Beckbury held one-ninth. 2. Alexander fitz Roger of Newport held one-ninth. 3. Richard de Brug held a ninth. 4. The Prior of Wombridge held a ninth by grant of Alianore (Mussun) in pure almoign. 5. Ralph de Burton and Henry de Burton held a ninth between them. 6. 7. The son of William de Buri of Uppington was under age and in ward to John Mansell by gift of the King. His share was two-ninths. He had already married a daughter of Hugh de Wlon keslow, the Jurors knew not by whose license. 8. WUliam Boch (read Dod) held a ninth. 9. Richard Surbrunt (read Corbront) held a ninth. He too was a Minor in ward to John Mansell.1 At the Forest Assizes of 1262, it was presented how the Bosc of Uppington having been long wasted by the Lords of the vill, had been seized into the King's hand at the previous eyre of John Biset, and was stUl an escheat. In Michaelmas Term 1282, Richard de Bury, John Coly, Richard de Bruges, Richard Corbrond, and WiUiam de Eyton, were found to have disseized the Prior of Wombridge of a tenement in Upping ton juxta le Wrokene. Two of these were only Feoffees in the Manor. The Lords of the Manor as enumerated in the Feodary of 1284, were WUliam de la Sale,2 Richard de Bruges, The Prior of Wombridge, Richard del Bury, and Richard Curbrant. They were still jointly responsible for the old service due to the Crown. At the Assizes of 1292 it was presented how Roger Muisun had once held Uppin\u00b0*ton by service of a sore-hawk, and how the said service was now changed to an annual rent of 4s. \u2014 Richard Corbrond, Richard de Bruges, and Richard de Bury, were now the only repre- which I usually assign to this Feodary. 1 Rot.

They each held 5 nocates in that capacity. Richard de Bury held a second 5 nocates by pur chase. Other 5 nocates, also purchased, were held by John Coly. The residue (stated to be 15 nocates of land) was held by the Prior of Wombridge. I suppose then, that the Prior had three-ninths of the Manor.1 Other statements affecting this coheirship have been given under Harrington, where it may be seen how Bishop Bumell's heir was really at this moment (November 1292) Mesne-lord of Uppington, and holding over the Coparceners.3 Hence in the Inquest taken in 1294 on the death of Philip Bur nel, he is said to have held certain rent in Opynton of the King, by payment of a hawk.3 But in another Inquest, taken in February 1301, as to the tenements of the late Philip Burnel, Openton is said to have been held in socage of the King, and Gunceline de Badles mere to be now tenant thereof till Philip Burnel's heir should be of fuU age.4 In the Nomina Villarum of 1316, John de Haulowe (then Baron of Holgate) stands as Lord of Hopynton. An agreement, probably drawn up early in the fourteenth century, states that sundry disputes had arisen between the Prior of Wom bridge, on the one part, and Richard Corbrond, Richard de la Buri, and Roger de la Sale, on the other part, concerning nine portions (particulis) of Uppington Bosc. The Prior now conceded 4 portions to the said Coheirs, so that it would seem that the Prior had now five-ninths of the Manor. Each of the parties bound himself to ob serve this agreement under a penalty of 20 merks, to be applied in Aid of the Holy Land. It was attested by Sir Fulk le Strange, Sir Robert de Stepulton, Sir John le Strange, and William Rondulf.5 A document of the year 1341 shows Uppington under a very different combination of tenures. The tax of the Ninth had been assessed at 10 merks on the whole Parish of Wroxeter. It was agreed to apportion this assessment at so much on each half-virgate in the Parish. Uppington was found to contain 18 half- virgates. As far as I can judge, not one of the ancient tenants-in-capite was now represented hereditarUy. \u2014 The Prior of Wombridge held 8 half- virgates, John Coly had 2 half- virgates, and one nocate (i. e. 2 i half- virgates), Richard de Lithe, 1 half-virgate, Philip Clerke, 1 nocate (i.e. { a half-virgate), John Wodewart, 1 half-virgate, 1 The name and share of one Coparcener is evidently omitted.

I now return to say something of each of the nine co-heiresses of Roger Mussun, and their respective descendants. \u2014 1. Alina Mussun married Hugh de Beckbury, who occurs as early as 1196, and who died towards the close of 1226. His inte rests at Harrington, Beckbury, Golding, and Sundorn, have been already sketched. The following extracts from the Wombridge and Lilleshall Chartularies will show what became of his interests in Uppington. About the year 1200, AUna, wife of Hugh de Beckbury, with assent of her heir, gave her share of Wycheley to Wombridge Priory, reserving a rent of 12c?. Witnesses, William Pantun (of Dawley, I presume), Philip, his brother, William de Hadley, &c.2 At the same time apparently, because with the same witnesses and for the same rent, Hugh de Beckbury did the same.3 These two Deeds might have been combined in one, but the Canons of Wom bridge preferred separate Vouchers from husband and wife. The transaction was in confirmation, but the reserved rent was in dimi nution, of Roger Mussun's grant of Wicheley. About the year 1220 \"Hugh, Lord of Beckbury\" (for the souls' health of himself and his wife Alina), and \" Alina, wife of Hugh, Lord of Beckbury,\" expedited a second pair of Deeds to the Priory, conveying a share of Wichley, but without any reserved rent. Witnesses, Baldwin de Hodnet, Hugh fitz Robert, WiUiam de Hadley, &c.4 At the same time and with the same witnesses, Hugh, Lord of Beckbury, in exchange for half a virgate in Golden (before aUuded to,5) gave the Priory a half-virgate in Uppington, held by Robert the Anjovin, under feoffment of Roger Mussun, and for which a rent of 12c?. was due to Roger Mussun's heirs.6 Hugh de Beckbury, with assent and wiU of his wife Alina, gave to LilleshaU Abbey all his bosc of Mount GUbert, to wit, the ninth part of the bosc which pertained to the vill of Uppinton, outside the hedge of the arable land ; \u2014 to hold under himself and his heirs in perpetual almoign.7 s Supra, Vol. VI. p. 99. 1 Haughmond Chartulary, so. 158. 2.3.4 Wombridge Chartulary, Tit. 6 Chartulary (ut supra), No. 72.

A rent of a pair of white gloves is reserved on this grant. Witnesses, John de Beck bury (son and heir of the Grantress), Adam de Costarde, and Hugh de Beckbury (her second son).3 I believe that the rest of Alina Mussun's share of Uppington continued to be held in-fee by the families of Coli and Drayton. All that remained in the fourteenth century to John de Beckbury, great-grandson of Alina Mussun, was a penny rent, receivable from Richard de la Lythe (who lived at Drayton Abbots) on half a vir gate, and a pair of white gloves, receivable from the lands late held by John Coli.

By one he gives his share of Holemere meadow and two acres, adjacent to lands of Hamo de Aldrescote and Richard del Buri. Witnesses, Sir Madoc de Sutton, Saer de Berwick, Henry Mauveysin of Berwick, Thomas his brother, Hamo de Aldrescote, William de Eyton, Roger son of Ulger de Sugdon.3 By the other Deed, \" Richard de Bruges gives to the Priory 3 acres in the field towards Beslow, adjoining lands of Richard Corbrond and William the Parson.

Her land in that Hundred was worth one merk (per annum) .

Witnesses, Baldwin de Hodnet, Hugh fitz Robert, WiUiam de Hadley, and Adam de Cherlton.1 Using the same style, and between the last deed and the year 1224, she gave all her land in Uppington to the Priory, binding herself and heirs in a penalty of 40 merks to warrant the same to the Canons. Witnesses, Baldwin de Hodnet, Walter de Hugford, and Walter Mareschall.2 Something or other made this Deed inoperative, as we are as sured by Alianore's later and far less comprehensive grants to the Priory. First however I must quote a Deed which may have been earlier than the last, as it certainly passed before the year 1227. Thereby the same Alianore gives the Priory her share of La Mare and 4 seilions in Uppington.

Philip and Isabella are to pay a rent of Id. to the Canons, and to undergo a penalty of 20 merks if they swerve from this agreement. The Canons give them one merk down.

The same Philip and Isabel give to Wombridge 3 sei lions in Uppington, and their share in 3 other seilions and in a meadow lying between Longmere and Uppington. Witnesses, Robert de Beslow, Roger de Apley, Robert de Clotley.2 Between the years 1256 and 1262 the same Philip, with consent of his wife Isabel, gives the Canons a messuage and croft in Up pington. Witnesses, Sir Madoc de Sutton, Hugh de Beslow, Wil liam de Eyton.3 At last, and within the same interval, the said Philip and Isabel, with consent of Richard their son and heir, give a seylion in Le Oold and the messuage built thereon, and moreover all the lands and tenements which could in any way accrue to them and their heirs, within and without the vill of Uppington. Witnesses, Sir Madoc de Sutton, John de Ercalew, and John fitz Hugh.4 The Wombridge Chartulary enables me to descend one generation later in this family. \u2014 Between the years 1276 and 1300 \" Richard, son and heir of Philip, late son of Richard de Hunditon and (son and heir) of Isabella, daughter of Alianore Moussoun his (the said Philip's) wife\" concedes to Wombridge all his right in all lands and tenements and escheats, which the Canons had from his Parents, within and without the vill of Uppington.

Hence about the year 1202-3 we find that \" Dionisia Muisun wife of William Logenhalreh, with the assent and will of her heir (pro bably heirs), gives to Wombridge Priory all her share of Wichley. Witnesses, William Pantulf, William de Hadley, John de Chet winde.\"2 In October 1223 I know that William de Longner was recently deceased, for his wife Dionisia was suing for her dower in Longner. The following Deed passed, I think, in 1223, but certainly between 1222 and 1227. \u2014 \" Dionisia daughter of Roger Mussun, late wife of William de Longenalre, grants to Wombridge Priory all her share of the land in Wichelee. Witnesses, Adam de Cherleton, William Mareschall, Richard de Bruges, Thomas de Eston, Robert de Cherleton, Alan Chaplain.\"3 In October 1227, Dionisia Mussun was apparently deceased, for her daughters, Abee and Isabel, are then registered as each holding lands of 10s. annual value in Bradford Hundred;4 \u2014 obviously at Uppington. Alice Bochart was at this time the widow of a second husband, Elias de Bourton. She is known to have enfeoffed Thomas de Erleton in half a virgate in Uppington. As \" Alice de Burton, daughter of Roger Boscard,\" and as a widow, she enfeoffed Wil liam Sibern in all the land which remained in her demesne at Up pington and in all her part of Bulthmere meadow ; reserving a rent of 12d. Witnesses, Sir William de Drayton, Rector of the Church of Wroxeter, Richard de Bruges, and William Marescall of Up pington.5 This was between 1227 and 1241. In 1255 (as we have seen) Henry de Burton was Lord of a moiety of one-ninth share of Uppington. He was son and heir of Alice Bochart. We have seen under Bourton that he was living in 1261, and that very soon afterwards he, with the concurrence of Edelina his wife, made grants in Bourton to Shrewsbury Abbey. He made one grant only to Wombridge, and that apparently about 1260.

Witnesses, Master John de Cherlton, Richard de la Buri of Uppington, William de Eyton.1 I think it possible that Henry de Burton was identical with a person who about the year 1237 had attested an Uppington Deed as Henry de Clotley. li so, he had a daughter, Felicia, to whom he made over parts of his estate at Uppington, and she was the widow (of a husband unnamed) some time before Henry de Burton's decease. At all events there was, about 1253, one Felicia de Uppington, evidently a Landowner in the Manor, and how she obtained such an interest, unless from Henry de Burton, I know not. As Felicia de Upinton, and as a widow, she gives to Wombridge all her share in the demesne meadow of Upinton, viz. Becthelamesmedewe, and in Holemaresmedewe. She also gives a rent of 12(.., which William Sybarne sometime held under her in Upping ton. Witnesses, Walter de Hugford, Madoc de Sutton, William de Leighton (died 1263), Walter de Kemberton, Herbert de Hydeshall (Idsall), Robert de Beslow, Robert de Cherleton, Richard de Byrches, William de Eyton.2 About the same time Felicia, daughter of Henry de Clotleg, in her widowhood, en feoffed WiUiam, son of William Sibern in that half-virgate in Uppington, which Robert Trasch formerly held. This was for one merk paid down and for id. annual rent. Witnesses, Sir Madoc de Sutton, Sir Herbert de Ideshall, Walter de Kemberton, Hamo de Aldrescote, Richard de Bruges, William de Eyton, Hamo de Uppington.3 Perhaps this Felicia was she who afterwards (about 1260) appears as wife of Wil liam Sibern (II.), alias William Constantine, her own Feoffee. About that time the said WiUiam resigned aU his tenures in Uppington to Wombridge Priory ; the Canons undertaking to provide a certain maintenance and annuity for him and his wife FeUcia for their lives.4 I now return to Isabella Bochart, the other daughter and coheir of Roger Bochart and Dionisia Mussun. She, before the year 1209, was wife of Ralph Marshall (I.) and mother of Ralph Mar shall (II.). Her husband was living in November 1236, and is named as an Uppington Landholder in a Deed somewhat later. He was however deceased in 1240, for before that year \" Isabella, Relict of Ralph surnamed Marescall of Burton\" gives to her daughter Alice all her land in Uppington, to hold by a rent of a pair of gloves. Witnesses, William Dreiton, Chaplain; Benedict de Eston, and Robert de Cherleton.

Witnesses, Thomas Clerk of Arlton (Orle ton), Alan de Sugdon, and Robert de Cherleton.1\" Within the next five years the same Alice, now wife of Henry Panton, joins her said husband in giving a half-virgate and half noke in Uppington (held by Hugh and William Sibern, brothers) to Wombridge Priory, and also the Is. rent arising from the mes suage late held by William Sibern. Witnesses, Sir William de Ercalew, Sir Hugh fitz Robert, Sir Odo de Hodenet.2 As Alice daughter of Ralph Marshall of Burton, and as now a Widow, she afterwards renews this grant in the presence of Sir Odo de Hodnet, Sir Madoc de Sutton, and Thomas de Cherleton (probably Erleton).3 This passed about 1262, nor do I think a tantamount grant to be much later, which is tested by Sir John de Ercalew, Sir John fitz Hugh, Sir John fitz Aer, Hugh de Beslow, William de Eyton, and Master John de Cherleton.4 Another grant by the same, to the same, is attested by the three first witnesses of the last, but it conveys a virgate, a half-virgate, and 12d. rent, and so, if correct, will have been a grant of double the previous quantity of land.5 I suppose that thus the Wombridge Canons became possessed of all that Alice Marshall had to give. Though her brother Ralph Marshall (II.) , of Burton, had appeared in 1255 as Lord of a moiety of one-ninth of Uppington, his was only a mesne tenure, consisting of the glove-rent reserved in Isabella Bochart's grant to Alice. It is not likely that such a right would reappear in his de scendants. 6. Alice Mussun was the wife of that Adam de Cherleton who appears among the Coparceners of Uppington in 1211. About the year 1220, Adam de Cherlton, at the request and advice of his wife Alice, and with consent of his heir, gives to Wombridge that share of Wichley which accrued to him in right of the said Alice, and on which the Canons (in virtue, I presume, of Roger Mussun's grant) had begun to budd houses. In return the Canons gave to Adam that half-virgate in Harrington which Philip the Chaplain held.

Another Deed, of nearly the same date, is by Adam de Cherlton with consent of his heirs, and is attested by Robert de Hamarse, Roger de Apley, and Philip de Paynton. In this Deed nothing is said about the half-virgate in Harrington, but the share of Wichley is simply conveyed.1 A third Deed by Alice Mussun, \" wife of Adam de Cherlton,\" is with assent of her heirs and sets forth the full exchange. Witnesses, Baldwin de Hodnet, William de Hadley, and Robert de Cherlton.2 Roger de Chesthul, sister's son of Alice Mussun, conveyed his whole interest in Uppington to the said Alice and her husband Adam. Hence, after some disputes with Roger de Chesthul's heirs, the descendants of Adam and Alice will be found seized of two out of nine shares of the Manor. Again, Adam de Charlton bought a share of Wichley from Meidus daughter of Roger Mussun, and con veyed it, about 1220, in frank almoign to Wombridge Priory. Wit nesses, Baldwin de Hodnet, Hugh fitz Robert, William de Hadley, Walter de Stirchley, Roger de Apley, Philip de Penynton.3 Before 1225 Adam de Cherlton was deceased, and Alice his widow, with assent of her heirs, made again a grant to Wombridge of her share of Wichley. Witnesses, \u2014 the three first witnesses of the last Deed.4 About the year 1225-6, Alice daughter of Roger Mussun, still a widow, enfeoffs William son of Edward de Drayton and Cecdia his wife in half a virgate in Uppington, for 4 merks paid and at a fixed rent. Witnesses, Sir Thomas de Constantine, Richard de Leighton, WiUiam Chaplain of Drayton, Robert de Broughton (Brockton), Thomas de Erleton.5 Adam and Alice de Cherlton seem to have been succeeded by a son and heir whom I will call Adam de Cherlton (II.) . He attests a dated Deed of 1230, and before 1236 he had enfeoffed his own son William, in 3 bovates (or | virgate), and Richard de Byrche, in hab0 a virgate, in Uppington. These lands seem to have been part of those which Adam de Cherlton (I.) had purchased from Roger de Chesthul. Now, the said Roger and his brother John being dead without issue, their three sisters, Isabella, Petronilla, and Mabel, calling themselves daughters of Isabella de ChesthuU (that is of Isabella Mussun), impleaded William fitz Adam and Richard de Byrche as tenants in possession of the aforesaid lands.

Fine was the result, levied November 21, 1236, whereby the three Plaintiffs renounced their right in favour of Adam de Cherlton for one merk. Adam de Cherlton (II.) died between 1237 and 1241, and was succeeded by his aforesaid son, William. William de Cherlton must have been very young, at the time (1236), when he appears above as his Father's Feoffee. However, his son and heir was born, according to one account, in 1237, and according to another, before 1240. And further, in the interval between 1236 and 1241, we find- William de Cherlton, following his father Adam as a witness, ap pearing as himself a landholder, and, under the name of William fitz Adam, attesting Charters in which his father is not named. It is clear that this William de Cherlton was the same person with him who is called William de la Curt in a Writ ordering his lands to be extended, and bearing date July 10, 1243. An Inquest was forthwith held, and among the Jurors were Thomas de Erleton, Robert de Beslow, Robert de Cherleton, Robert de Clotley, Robert Bras, Richard de Rushton, Richard, Clerk of Rushton, and Alan fitz Yvo. They said, that William de la Cort, deceased, had held 6 bovates (i. e.l\\ virgates) in demesne, at Uppington, besides rents amounting to \u00a31. 9s. 5d. and a pair of gloves. His wife was entitled to a third of this estate. His son, Richard, was now three years of age and over. All this is perfectly reconcilable with what we should expect to find, viz. that William de la Cort or de Cherlton had been Lord of two-ninths of Uppington.1 It so happened that Reginald Corbrond, another of the joint Lords of Uppington, was dead at the same time as WiUiam de Cherlton, also leaving a son in minority. Three shares of Uppington were therefore now in the custody of the Crown, but the Inquests taken in 1243 seem to have been mis laid or misunderstood. Hence, in a Writ dated March 2, 1249, the King informs his Escheator (Henry de Wingham) that \" custody of certain land in the vill of Upton was in the King's hand ; that it was worth more than 40s. per annum ; but that the King was ignorant of the circumstances of this escheat (unde nescimus ratio nem) and wished to be more fully informed.\" Another Inquest (attended by Robert de Cherlton, Ralph de Erleton, William de Eyton, Hamo de Alderiscot, and Robert de Clotley) was the result. It was reported by them that the land which was in manu Regis at 1 Inquisitions, 27 Hen. III., No. 26 (a). 23 VIII."], [640, "178 UPPINGTON. Upiton was held in capite by service of three out of nine parts of a sore sparrow-hawk, and that it was worth yearly \u00a32. 4s. 5d. and a pair of white gloves.1 It is evident that soon after this the King granted the custody of these three shares of Uppington to John Mansel, of whom I have spoken on other occasions.2 Hence it came to pass that in 1255 John Mansell appears with the wardship of three-ninths of Upping ton, and that, in two of the said three-ninths, the son of William de Buri was his ward, and was already married to a daughter of Hugh de Longslow.3 So then William de Cherlton alias William de la Court had had a third name, viz. William de Buri ; and we shall see that his descendants were usually called De Buri. This was be cause their residence was built on a spot in Uppington, called The Bury, which is frequently mentioned in the Wombridge Chartulary. Being further the chief Coparceners in Uppington, the Cherltons probably had the best house of residence. To that I attribute the fact of William de Cherlton having been called De la Court. But it is a most extraordinary fact that a third Inquest had yet to be held on the estate of William de Cherlton (deceased in 1243), and that the Writ ordering this third Inquest is dated May 11, 1259, and calls him William de Uppinton. A much fuller Inquest, taken on June 13 following, was attended by Robert de Cherleton, Henry Panton and ten other Jurors, not connected with Uppington. This Jury found that William de Uppinton had held in capite, 4 virgates in Uppington and Harrington,4 by services of two out of nine parts of a sore sparrow-hawk. He had also held two virgates in Drayton-subtus-Lyme, under the Abbot of Shrewsbury, for a rent of 8s. ; and one virgate in the vill of Cherleton, of the Church of St. Mary at Shrewsbury, for a rent of Is. Richard son and heir of the deceased had attained the age of 22 on June 11, 1259 (two days before the Inquest) .5 From this time till his death (about 1307) Richard del Buri of Uppington, as he is usually called, is constantly occurring. To say nothing of his attestations of undated Deeds, he appears on Jury Lists of 1274, 1284, and 1285 ; accompanied in the last instance by Reginald de la Buri. Other notices, already given, show him under the dates of 1282, 1284, and 1292, with a prominent interest in 1 Inquisitions, 33 Hen. III., No. 54. 2 Vol. I. p. 339 ; Yol.

III., No. 31."], [641, "179 UPPINGTON. Uppington.1 It would appear from the Wombridge Chartulary that he made very many grants to that House. This appearance is in part fallacious, for some of the Deeds which are dated as having passed in the time of \" King Edward \" belong to the reign of Ed ward II. and to the son of this Richard. However it is Richard de la Bury (I.), who on March 31, 1303, concedes to Philip Prior of Wombridge all his shares in the Mose meadow, and releases all service due on certain land which his Tenant, John son of Hugh (Noyse) of Uppington, had delivered up to him. Witnesses, Roger Corbet, Peter de Eyton, Pagan de Preston.3 On September 30, 1304, Richard del Buri acknowledges a debt of \u00a317, due to the Priory, and if it be not repaid at stated periods, gives the Canons power to proceed against him according to the Statute of Acton Burnel? Probably the following Deeds of Richard del Bury of Up pington belong to this Richard, and, if so, passed about this time. He gives to Wombridge an acre in the field towards Wichley. Witnesses, John de Stivinton, Roger de Mokeley, Richard Cor brond.* He gives to the same Priory, the whole upper part of Broadmeadow, and to the lights of the Church of St. Leonard at Wombridge, and of the Chapel of St. Nicholas, at Uppington, he gives a seylion of land at Uppington. Witnesses, Master John de Cherlton, John Coli, Richard Corbrond of Uppington.5 The only other Deed which I shall assume to be that of Richard de la Bury (I.) is his Will. It is undated, but was executed pro bably in anticipation of his end and between the years 1304 and 1308. It was attested by William Cay of Wombridge, John Coli, Richard Corbrond, John son of Hugh (Noyse), and John Hugh of Eyton (or Hugh de Eyton), the two last being Executors. He directs that his body be buried in the Cemetery of Wombridge, and with his body he bequeaths the upper part of Broadmeadow, and his best ox. He also gives for the lights, &c, a seylion, &c. (as al ready specified in a distinct Deed). Of his goods, chattels, and live stock, some part is bestowed on the poor. The oblations in Uppington Chapel, the Friars Juniors (Minorites, I presume), the Preachino* Friars, the Augustine Friars, and one or two Legatees are named for benefactions. Of the residue of his goods some part is to be bestowed for the good of his soul, some part is to go to Christiana his wife, and a third part, to be divided into three equal portions and given to his three sons Adam, John, and Richard.6 1 Supra, pp. 157-8.

Richard de la Buri (II.), though mentioned last in his Father's Will, was the eldest of his three sons. His Mother was apparently the first wife of his Father, and so a Longslow. In his Deeds he frequently mentions Christiana as his stepmother (noverca or ma tertera), and as Christiana de Harrington. On May 3, 1308, he expedites the first of his dated concessions to Wombridge Priory. It is a 40 years' lease to Prior Philip of half a virgate in Upping ton, and a concession of his shares of Mose meadow.1 His cotem porary or subsequent concessions and grants to the same House are too numerous even for an abstract. On July 8, 1323, he makes provision for his son and heir, Richard, then married to Matilda, daughter of William son of Robert de Sutton. The lands or in terests which he transfers to them and their heirs, are held by Adam le Qu (or Cocus) and his wife Matilda, John le Rider and his wife Isabella, Christiana de Harrington, John de Buri, Roger Hod, and William Wyoth.2 On July 15, 1323, the young couple re-grant part of the pre mises, viz. a messuage and 20 acres, to Richard del Buri, Senior, for life.8 On May 13, 1325, Richard de Buri the younger was deceased; and Margery, his sister, transfers a tenure under Wombridge Priory to Matilda his widow, Richard de Buri, senior, attesting the trans action, as Margery's father.4 Richard de Buri the younger died without issue, but Matilda his widow, though his father and sister were living, became Tenant in fee-simple of all that had passed under the said father's Deed of 1323. By a Deed dated September 21, 133], she transfers the whole of her estates, rents, and reversionary rights, thus and other wise acquired, both in Uppington and Harrington, to Sir Roger Corbet of Hadley, \u2014 to hold to him and his heirs, of the Lords of the Fees.6 A Fine of March 15, 1333, further secured the pre mises to Sir Roger Corbet, the ostensible consideration being \u00a3100 sterling.6 Thus the main interest of the Buri family seems to have been alienated ; but Richard de Buri (II.) was still living. By Deed of January 6, 1333, Richard del Buri, Senior, actually acknowledged himself to have done fealty to Sir Roger Corbet for the messuage and 25 (sic) acres which he now held under Sir Roger for life. He further quitclaims all right in the premises already conveyed to Corbet by his daughter-in-law.7 i.j.3.4.6.6.7 Chartulary (ut supra), Nos. 210, 119, 120, 146, 194, 217, 199."], [643, "UPPINGTON. 181 Richard del Buri (II.) was deceased in 1339. He left a widow Margery, a daughter Margery, and a son Adam, surviving him, but with very slender estates, which they appear to have speedily sur rendered. \u2014 On April 1, 1339, Margery, the widow, quitclaims to Richard Crow her right as of dower in one acre at Uppington.1 On July 25, 1344, as \" Margery, widow of Richard, son of Richard del Buri,\" she concedes to Richard, Prior of Wombridge, all her right in 18 acres, which her late husband had held (I presume under the Priory) in Uppington.2 On August 1, 1344, using the same style, she quitclaims to Sir Roger Corbet, of Hadley, all her right of dower or otherwise in any tenements which her late husband had at any time held in Upping ton.3 By another Deed of the same date she quitclaims to the same, her right in 2 messuages and 31 acres in Uppington. 4 Meantime, on May 3, 1344, Adam, the son, and I presume the right representative, of Richard del Buri, quitclaims to Richard, Prior of Wombridge, all his right in the estates of his late father at Uppington and Harrington; and this was attested by Sir Roger Corbet.5 Again, on June 29, 1344, Adam, son of Richard del Buri, quit claims to Sir Roger Corbet all right in the lands and tenements which had belonged to his late father in Uppington and Harring ton.6 The quitclaim related in each case, I think, to whatever Richard de Buri deceased had held under the respective Grantees. Lastly, on March 19, 1346, Margery daughter of Richard del Buri, quitclaims to Richard Prior of Wombridge, a messuage and half-virgate in Uppington, which her father had given her.7 7.

Witnesses, Thomas de Constantine, Richard de Leighton, William de Eyton.1 I think that Isabel Mussun was the second wife of Richard de Chesthul, and not mother of his undoubted heir Robert, who never had any concern in Uppington. Soon after the above Deed, Roger de ChesthuU probably died without issue, and perhaps under age ; so that his grant to Adam de Cherlton can hardly have been final. John fitz Richard, whose minority in 1227 has Jbeen already pointed out,2 was, I take it, brother of the whole blood, and heir to Roger de ChesthuU. He was also, I think, in ward to his Aunt Alianore. But before October 1228 he also seems to have died without issue. At that period Isabel de Chesthull's 3 nokes in Uppington were being held for a term, of which 8 years had to run, by Engelard son of Robert de Pichford. The said Engelard conceded them, for the remainder of that term, to Wombridge Priory, at a rent of 7s. per annum. His Deed of Transfer expressly states that he, Engelard, had held the premises under \" Roger and John sons of Ysabella daughter of Roger Mussun.\" It is attested by Thomas Corbet, Roger de Apley, Robert de Brockton, Richard de Bruges, and William Scrivener (Scriptor)? It will be remembered that in November 1236, Isabella, Petro nilla, and Mabel, daughters, and now coheirs, of Isabel Mussun, were impleading Adam de Cherlton (II.) for 3 bovates and half a virgate in Uppington.4 Doubtless the 3 bovates were the 3 nokes above mentioned ; and, on expiration of the term held by Wombridge, Adam de Cherlton (II.) had seized them under Roger de Chest hull's grant to his father, and enfeoffed his own son William therein. Certain it is that, whether by Roger de Chesthull's grant, or by the Fine with Roger de Chesthull's sisters in 1236, Adam de Cherlton possessed, and transmitted to his heirs, Isabel Mussun's ninth share of Uppington. 1 Chartulary (ut supra), No. 127 (b). \u25a0 Supra, p. 167. 3 Chartulary (ut supra), No. 182. 4 Supra, p. 175."], [645, "183 UPPINGTON. 8.

In that year, between May and September, William de Daventre fines 40s., that he may have to wife Ysolda, daughter of Roger Mussun, with her inheritance. He it is who appears as William Mareschall in 1211, and with a ninth share of the Uppington Serjeantry. In 1202-3, Isowde Muisun, wife of William Mareschall, for the souls' health of herself and her husband, and with consent of her heir (probably under 10 years of age), gave her share of Wichley to Wombridge Priory. Witnesses, William Pantulf, Herbert Mal voisin, Roger de Apley.1 At the same time, I think, William Marescall, for the souls' health of himself and his wife, and with assent of his wife and his heir, gave the same.

But, what is more remarkable, she reappears under the name of Cecilia. For instance. \u2014 About the year 1239 William Moraell (read Marshall) of Oppin ton, with assent of Cecilia his wife, and for 30s. paid down, and a rent of 4d., enfeoffs William Sibern in a ninth part of Uppington Mill and in 4 seylions of land, and in a meadow called Bonewelle.

William Marshall survived her, but was himself dead on February 21, 1244, when the King received the homage of William Dod, as son and heir of Isolda Mussun. The Sheriff was to take security for William Dod's relief (half a merk) , and then to give him seizin of all lands which William le Marescal, Isolda's husband, had held of her inheritance the day he (Marescal) died.3 It is probable from this that \\Yilliam Mareschal had had issue by Isolda Mussun, and had held her lands, after her decease, by custom of England. William Dod had occurred more than twenty years before his stepfather's death as witness of an Uppington Deed. In fact he must have been at least 42 years of age in 1244. In 1244 or 1245 William Dod enfeoffed (or rather renewed the feoffment of) Wil liam Sibern, in a share of Uppington Mill, but reserving a rent of 12d. Witnesses, William de Brug, Richard de Brug, William de Eyton. On June 18, 1245, a Fine was levied between William Dod, Plaintiff, and Baldwyn Prior of Wombridge, Tenant, of half a vir gate in Uppinton and half a virgate in Wychley, whereof was Plea. William acknowledged the Prior's right \" under gift of his mother Isolda,\" whose heir he was. In return he was to have the benefit of monastic prayers in the usual form. Another half-virgate in Uppington was at this time held under William Dod, by Howel, son of Griffin de Sutton. Howel, in 1244-5, sold the same for 3 merks to Wombridge Priory, reserving a rent of 5s., payable to himself at Alveley (and which was in fact his own rent due to William Dod) . Witnesses, Sir William de Hercall, Sir Hugh fitz Robert, Sir Madoc de Sutton, Geoffrey Clerk (proba bly Geoffrey Griffin), Richard de Grenhul, John de Gret, Thomas de Erleton, Robert de Besselawe, Robert de Cherleton, William de Brug, Robert de Clotleg.4 About this time, and certainly between 1244 and 1248, William Dod enfeoffs Hamo de Alderescot in three nokes of his demesne in Uppington, for 20 merks paid down and at a rent of 2s.

William de Hadley, Hugh fitz Robert, and Richard de Leighton.1 We now know exactly how 2J virgates of William Dod's inheri tance were circumstanced. They probably constituted the whole of his Estate at Uppington. When I add that within the next 20 years, his Tenants, Hamo de Alderiscot and William Sibern (II.) conveyed their interest in all that they held under William Dod to Wombridge Priory, it will be seen that nothing remained to William Dod but his reserved rents. He eventually surrendered everything to the Priory, that is between the years 1256 and 1272 he gives all his share of Uppington Mill (which share was really 12d. rent) and 5s. rent which he was used to receive from Howel de Opinton (that is from Howel fitz Griffin). Witnesses, John fitz Hugh, John de Ercalew, John fitz Aer, knights \u25a0 William Pilrin of Dreyton, William the Parson, his brother; Hugh de Beslow, and Nicholas (read Richard) de Brug.2 We also know that William Dod surrendered to Wombridge \"the 2s. rent which he used to receive from Hamo de Hopiton,\" that is from Hamo de Alderiscot.3 Thus then did the Prior of Wombridge obtain the whole of a second ninth share of Uppington. I should here remark that one William de Opiton, a Tenant-iw capite, was deceased on April 24, 1265, and that the Escheator citra Trent was ordered to seize his lands.4 I cannot tell whether it was William Dod who was thus deceased or not, but I can assign the circumstance of the Writ to no other cause. It is probable that William Dod left descendants at Alveley,5 but he being not really a Tenant-i n- capite at his death, the above Writ of diem clausit re sulted in no Inquest. 9. Juliana Mussun, another of the daughters and coheirs of Roger Mussun, was first the wife of * * * Corbrond, by whom she had a son Reginald, born before 1203. In 1203 * * * * Corbrond was dead, and Juliana was the wife of Walter de Beckbury. The two following Deeds probably passed during Juliana's widowhood, and about the year 1200 \u2014 Juliana daughter of Roger Muisun, with consent of her heir, gives her part of Wicheley to Wombridge Priory, reserving 12d. rent.

In the year 1230, William (read Walter) de Beckbury and Juli ana his wife, daughter of Roger Muisun, commit to Wombridge Priory their share of Broad-meadow for 12 years, commencing with the year of King Henry's transfretation ; but the Canons were not to begin to receive the produce of the said meadow till the year following (i.e. 1231). Witnesses, Adam de Cherlton, William Marescall, Roger (Query, Richard?) Brug.3 Between 1230 and 1236, Juliana Mussun, with consent of Walter de Beckbury her husband, gives to Wombridge all her share of Berthewelle meadow. Witnesses, Adam de Cherleton, Benedict de Eston, Richard de Bruges, Robert de Cherleton, Thomas de Erleton, Ivo de Erleton.4 On August 27, 1236, Juliana Mussun being dead, the King re ceived the homage of Reginald Corbrond her son and heir. His Relief was half a merk.5 About 1236-7 Reginald Corbrond, as son and heir of Juliana Mussun, confirmed her grant of a share of Wichley to Wombridge, reserving 12d. rent. Witnesses, Sir William de Erealewe, Hugh fitz Robert, Walter de Upton, Thomas de Erleton, Henry de Clot ley, Robert de Clotley, Adam de Cherleton.6 Reginald Corbrond enfeoffed Henry Malvoisin in his ninth share of Uppington Mill at 4d. rent. He also bequeathed cum corpore to Wombridge a rent of 12d. in Uppington. He also enfeoffed Hamo (de Aldrescot), servant of Master John Bacon, in 3| acres in Uppington, at a rent of l\\d.

His Widow had her thirds of this estate, and Richard son and heir of the deceased was now 8 years of age and over.1 About August 1, 1243, Isabella, widow of Reginald Corbrond, renounced to Hamo de Aldrescote her thirds in 3\\ acres which the said Hamo had purchased from her late husband ; and further, for 3s. paid and at a \\d. rent, she gave the said Hamo a three-years' term in a part of Long meadow, commencing on the said 1st of August. Witnesses, Robert de Cherlton, William de Bruges, William de Eyton.2 About the year 1244, the Canons of Wombridge gave to Philip de Huntiton the rent of 12d. which they had by bequest of Regi nald Corbrond.3 The Inquest which I have before aDuded to4 as taken in 1249, concerning escheated lands in Uppington, included the estate of Richard Corbrond. He was then in minority. He was soon afterwards given up to the custody of John Mansell, whose ward he still remained in 1255. A third Inquest, taken apparently in 1256, found Richard Corbrond to be still in ward to Sir John Mansel, but 21 years of age. His late Father's estate at Uppington is now put at 2 virgates and one noke, held by service of a ninth part of one sore sparrow-hawk, and worth \u00a31. 9s. 4\\d. per annum. He had held nothing except in capite said the Jurors, among whom were William de Cherlton, Hugh de Beslow, William de Upping ton, and Ralph de Clotleg.5 About the year 1265, as I guess, Richard Corbrond of Upping ton gives to Wombridge 4d. rent, receivable from that ninth of Up pington Mill which Henry Mauveysin of Berwick, deceased, had held under feoffment of Reginald Corbrond, the present Grantor's father. He also gives l\\d. rent arising from land which we know to have been held under him by Hamo de Alderiscote, and to have been given by the said Hamo about the year 1257, to the Priory. Richard Corbrond's cession of these mesne rights is attested by Master John de Cherleton, Robert de Cherleton, and Richard del Buri.6 About 1280, the same Richard Corbrond, with consent of Richard his son and heir, gives to Wombridge all his share of Longemar meadow and of Holemar, in the territory of Opinton.

About the year 1300, Richard Corbrond grants 4 acres to his son Alan. His Deed makes mention of his (the Grantor's) brother, Adam, of their father Richard, and of a William Corbrond, whom I take to have been a brother of the first Richard. It is attested by Richard del Buri of Uppington, Richard Bras of Donington, and Hugh Garmeston.3 About the same time, Richard Corbrond enfeoffs Robert fitz Reyner of Belswardine in a messuage and 3 acres in Uppington for 24s. paid, and a rent of Id. Witnesses, Richard del Buri, Ri chard de Bruges, Robert de Cherlton, Alan de Aston.3 We must date the succession of \u2014 Richard Corbrond (III.) as very soon after this, for his grant of 3 acres to his brother Alan is, in part at least, a repetition of their Father's grant of 4 acres, and is attested by two of the same three witnesses.4 It reserves a rose rent to the grantor, who was doubt less the elder brother. In lieu of Hugh Garmeston it is attested by Hugh de Beslow. From this time till 1322 Richard Corbrond of Uppington is a frequent witness of local Deeds; but in 1341 none of his name retained any fee-simple in Uppington, though the family was by no means extinct. Cotemporary with him was another Richard, son of William Corbrond. As to Alan, younger brother of Richard Corbrond (III.), he ob tained, besides the grants of his own family, certain feoffinents from Richard son of Robert de Wykys, and from Richard.de Bury (II.) , in all of which he enfeoffed his own wife Alice and her heirs in No vember 1336. Witnesses, Hugh Lord of Beslow, Walter le Spencer, William de Hanleye. There were Corbronds of Uppington, bearing the Christian name William, and living in 1323, 1339, 1356, 1371, 1378, 1399, and 1405 ; but I know nothing of their relation to the parent stock. I should now state what is known of one of Roger Mussun's co heirs who bore a different name to any of the above nine, though she was doubtless identical with one of them.\u2014 Meidus Mussun sold her share of Wichley to Adam de Cherl ton (I.) and he transferred it to Wombridge Priory.

It is certain from Edward II.'s Confirmation to Wombridge, that the Canons of that House knew not, in 1319, how this question of identity really stood. We are still less likely to determine it now.

Whoever founded Uppington Chapel, whether Gerard de Tornai, Hamo Peverel, or Roger Mussun, endowed it with the tithes of his demesne. Demesne-tithes then, could be, and were, in this in stance, separated from the Mother-Church, and bestowed on the Daughter. This very fact gives a high antiquity to Uppington Chapel, for such arbitrary consecration of tithes was only exercised in the first century after the Conquest. We have seen that about the year 1188, Roger Mussun granted the Advowson of Uppington Chapel to Wombridge ; and have ob served an expression in his Charter implying that the Chapel was endowed out of his demesne. No less than three Charters of Bishop Hugh de Novant allude to this gift.1 The first, dated November 24, 1190, merely concedes the Chapel. The next passed in the same year 1190, that is, before Lady Day 1191, and, pronouncing the Chapel to be vacant, appropriates it to the Priory, reserving a com petent maintenance for an officiating Priest. The third confirms the Advowson, naming \" Roger Lord of the Fee \" as the original Grantor thereof. It gives also to the Wombridge Canons a benefi cium or annual pension of half a merk, to be paid out of the profits of the Chapel, by any Clerk whom the Canons might present. G. (Geoffrey de Muschamp) Bishop of Coventry, confirms the right of R. (Roger) Prior of Wombridge, to the said pension. Wit nesses, William Abbot of Buildwas, R. (Richard or Ralph) Abbot of Haughmond, and the Prior of Lilleshall. This Charter was expedited at Lichfield by hand of Master Robert de Sandon on September 26, and in some year between 1198 and 1208.2 Bishop Muschamp further confirmed his predecessor's act of ap propriation. His Charter, as applicable to the Church of Sutton, has already been recited.3 It speaks of Uppington Chapel, mutatis mutandis, in the same way. I have, under Sutton, quoted other confirmations which relate to this Advowson. I think it must have been Pope Gregory IX., whose Bull, dated at Anagnia, in the sixth year of his Pontificate (that is February 27, 1233), speaks of certain Tithes claimed by M. Rector of Wroxe ter against Wombridge Priory. The Tithes were doubtless part of ' Wombridge Chartulary, Tit. Brock- 2 Wombridge Chartulary, 2%. Upinton, ton No 102 ; Tit. Upinton, No. 226 ; No. 43.

The matter had been already before the Chancellor of Oxford and other Dele gates of the Pope ; but their decision being accounted unjust, the Canons of Wombridge had appealed, stating that, by Papal Bulls granted to their House, they were free from payment of the tithes sought by the Plaintiff. Pope Gregory now commits the cause to Delegates, viz. the Dean, the Chancellor, and Master W. de Lych field a Canon, of London.1 The result of this Suit I do not find, but the question was renewed in after years, and, as we shall see, definitely settled. A Bull of Pope Martin IV., dated at Civita Vecchia, on June 1, 1283, and addressed to the Archdeacon of Exeter (who was then in Italy), dwells on the spoliation of that Portion of Wroxeter Church which was then held by Robert de Warrewyk. The said Portioner as well as his predecessors are ostensibly charged with unlawful alienations of Church property. The Archdeacon is now directed to take such measures as shall restore to the Wroxeter Prebend its ancient rights and Properties. A second letter of the same Pontiff, with the same date and address, shows that Robert de Warrewyk himself was at the Papal Court, and was the real procurer of the above Bull, though it seemed to reflect on his own conduct. This second Letter orders the Archdeacon of Exeter to quash all pro ceedings which might have been taken in England against Robert de Warrewyk since he left for the Papal Court. On June 15, 1283, Robert de Evesham, Archdeacon of Exeter, being then the guest of a Cardinal, received Pope Martin's Letters, and instantly appointed the Prior of St. Sepulchre (Warwick) and the Sacristan of St. Mary (Warwick) his Commissioners in the above business, he himself being occupied with other affairs. Ro bert de Warewyk, it would seem, now set out for England with the Archdeacon's Letter, which had been delivered to the Prior of St. Sepulchre at Warwick before September 14, 1283. The Prior on that day wrote to the Dean of Christianity at Shrewsbury. The latter was to cite the Prior of Wombridge to appear at St. Mary's, Warwick, on a stated day in October, and there to answer the com plaint of Robert de Warrewyk. On September 21, 1283, the Dean of Christianity certifies that he has served the Prior of Wombridge with the said summons. This cause was before the Prior of St. Sepulchre for nine years.

In the other letter the Archdeacon appoints such Commissaries, viz. the Prior and Sacristan of St. Wer burg5 s. The Parties, it seems, appointed their Proctors, and the Proctors duly appeared at Chester. The new Commissaries, after hearing the complaints against their Predecessors, held the appeal of Wom bridge Priory to be good, and decided upon annulling all the acts of the Prior of St. Sepulchre. The principal cause (that between Wombridge and the Prebendary) was adjourned. When at length the Commissaries heard it, its nature was as follows. \u2014 Robert de Warrewyk complained that the tithes before specified, though they belonged to his portion of Wroxeter Church, had been usurped by the Prior of Wombridge as Rector of Uppington. The Prior's defence was, that the tithes sought did not belong to the Wroxeter Prebend, for that, in great part, they were tithes of the former demesnes of Hamo Peverel and Roger Mussun, successive Lords of Uppington; but, as regarded Wichley, that was newly cultivated land (novale) and tilled by the Canons themselves, c-nd they produced Papal Privileges exempting them from any tithes chargeable on lands so cultivated.1 In May 1293 the Chester Commissioners gave sentence. They decided every point in favour of Wombridge, and imposed perpetual silence on the Wroxeter Portionist. In the following year Roger (de Molend), Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, sealed the said sen tence with his Seal, ad \u0153ternam rei memoriam? I have alluded elsewhere to a Suit which in 1346 was moved by the then Incumbent of the third Portion of Wroxeter, against the I bridge Chartulary, Appendix No. 6 ; and I the Haughmond Chartulary, so. 157, b. *^ 1 Tide supra, Tol.

On February 6, 1346, the Proctor of the Prior appealed to the protection of the Apo stolic See and of the Court of Canterbury, in general terms. On June 25, 1346, William de Wroxeter, the Mover of the Suit, got a Writ or \" Inhibition \" from the Court of Canterbury to the Rural Dean of Salop on the subject. On June 30, 1346, the Proctor of Wombridge made a second appeal, in Lichfield Cathedral, to Rome and Canterbury. On October 20, 1346, the Archbishop's Official dismissed William de Wroxeter's action (on the ground that he had not duly prosecuted it) and cancelled the inhibition of June 25. I may add that John Faber of Donington, and Nicholas Coke, John Clerk, and Robert le Synger of Uppington, were Co-Defendants with the Prior and Canons of Wombridge in the above affair. In 1535-6 the Prior of Wombridge was in receipt of 40s. per annum for a moiety of the tithes of Uppington Chapel.2 The other moiety went, I presume, to the Abbot of Haughmond as Rector of Wroxeter. We shall consult the Diocesan Registers in vain for any early Institutions to Uppington Chapel. When Bishop Novant allowed the Wombridge Canons to appropriate the Rectory, he made no re servation for a Vicar, nor did he provide that the officiating Priest should be presented to himself. Consequently the Church became Donative, and continued so till the present century. The Officiating Priest employed by the Canons of Wombridge at Uppington was probably removable at pleasure, and was merely en titled \" Chaplain of Uppington.\" Of these humble functionaries, one named \u2014 Ernald, attests Galiena Mussun's Deed, about 1195.3 Another, unnamed himself, had a son William, who occurs as a Freeholder in Uppington from 1246 to 1266.4* Sir William de la Cokes, of Uppington, Chaplain, occurs about 1300, and \u2014 Bartholomew, Chaplain of Uppington, in 1394 and 1402. 1 Supra, Tol.

Between the years 1141 and 1155 he is recorded as having given half a hide in Cherinton to Shrews bury Abbey.3 This grant, though subsequently confirmed by King Henry III. as a matter of form,3 had no real permanence ; for the Monks of Shrewsbury retained nothing at Cherrington. It is probable that Hamo Peverel' s illegitimate daughter, Seburga, had some feoffment in Cherrington, which was in due course in herited by Alan de Hadley, her son and heir. Alan de Hadley is said to have given a hide in Cherinton to Wombridge Priory.1 It is observable that Henry II.'s confirmation to that House, passing in the Autumn of 1181, mentions Alan de Hadley's grant in Che rinton to have been of a forndell (i. e. a virgate) only ; \u2014 and that Alan de Hadley's own Deed, already set forth,6 uses the same ex pression; \u2014 but that Pope Urban's Bull of 1187 confirms the grant as that of a whole hide, and attributes it to William de Hadley and his son aud heir, Alan, jointly. This would make it part of the original foundation of Wombridge Priory, and so early as the close of Henry I.'s reign. I cannot find that either Erleton's or Hadley's heirs retained anything in Cherrington. We have Adam de Horleton and Richard de Cherrington attesting a Deed which passed between 1174 and 118 1,6 and we have Adam de Horleton and Pagan de Cherrington attesting a Deed which passed in the same interval, but later than the first-named Deed.7 Now of these three persons I can only say 4 Monasticon, Tl. 390. 1 Domesday, so. 258, b.

Pagan de Cherrington was a Knight and a surviving member of that Jury which having determined a Chesswell suit in 1191 was summoned to record the particulars in 1200.1 In June 1200 he has also appeared as Visor in an Essoign of the Abbot of Lilleshall.3 Pagan de Cherrington also gave half a virgate in Cherrington to Wombridge Priory.3 After this we come so Thomas, Lord of Cherrington, who was certainly son of Richard, Lord of Cherrington, and possibly bro ther and heir of Pagan. I append to this account a table of the various Scutages which were assessed on Cherrington and on other Manors, reputed to be of the Fief of Tornai. It will there be seen that in 1204 Thomas de Cherrington was Lord of Cherring ton and responsible for scutage as a Tenant-in-capite. In 1206 this Thomas de Cherrington is assessed to scutage as Thomas de Eslege, but in 1214 he is again called Thomas de Cherrington. A Feodary of 1212 confirms the Scutage-Rolls, and says under the Escheats of Gerard de Tornai that Thomas de Cherinton holds of the King by service of one-fourth of a knight's-fee.4 \" Thomas, Lord of Cherrington, son of Richard, Lord of Cher rington,\" gave to Wombridge Priory his Fishery of Cherington, which was in the River Mees (super aquam de Mees), with a little meadow there. Thomas, Lord of Cherrington, was deceased in April 1234, when the King accepted the homage of William, his son and heir, in respect of one-fourth of a Knight's-fee which Tho mas had held in capite of the Honour of Shrawardine? William de Cherrington's Relief, viz. 25s., appears as paid on the Pipe-Roll of Michaelmas following. I should here explain what is meant by the tenure above de scribed. Shrawardine Castle had at a previous period garri soned and held by the Crown, though it belonged hereditarily to Fitz Alan. The necessary services of Castle-guard had not, during this period, been apportioned on Fitz Alan's Tenants, but on the Vassals of the Crown, and particularly on the Tenants of Tornai Escheats.

Thus in 1231 when the great Justiciar, Hubert de Burgh, had custody of Montgomery Castle for the Crown, the Scutages due on Cherrington and other Tornai fees were charged, indeed, on the Pipe- Roll, against the several Tenants, but the Justiciar is specially certified to be responsible for the whole, because these fees were in his hand. In 1232 the same thing recurred in respect of the Scutage of Elvein ; but in this case the Justiciar had quittance of the whole, under the general letters which he had, entitling him to gather his own scutages. When therefore in 1234 Cherrington is said to be held of the Honour of Shrawardine, the Honour of Mont gomery is really meant. At Michaelmas 1235 and Easter 1236 William de Cherrington paid in even instalments his assessment of 6*. 8d. chargeable on one-fourth of a Tornai .Fee held by him in capite? Before the year 1253 William de Cherrington had been succeeded by \u2014 Richard de Cherrington (II.). The latter, as \" Lord of Cherring ton,\" figures on an important Inquest taken in that year. The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 states that,\u2014 \"the Vill of Cherin ton is 4 hides, geldable, and pays 16... per annum for stretward, and 16,/. for motfee ; and does due suit to County and Hundred. Richard, Lord of the said vill, held it in capite of the King for one fourth of a knight's-fee. The Prior of Wombi-idge had 3 caru cates in the Manor worth \u00a32 per annum each. One of these caru cates he had by gift of Alan de Hadley. In the two others he had been enfeoffed about 1251 by Geoffrey Griffin. By gift of the same Geoffrey, the Prior had 4\\ acres of forest-land, \u2014 a pourpresture for which he had to pay 8d. per annum to the Exchequer, to exempt it from Regard? The increase of one hide on the Domesday hidage of Cherring ton is not to be passed over in silence. It may possibly indicate, that a Manor, called Cerlitone in Domesday, and consisting of one hide, had been originally a part of Cherrington, and that the two had been reunited. When I come to speak of Charlton-near- Shawbury, this question must be re-opened. A long interval now occurs in which I find no mention of any Lord of Cherrington. At length in 1284 we have the Manor in the hands of an heiress, called in one Feodary Isabella, and in an other, Sibilla de Cheryngton. The tenure too is increased to that 1 Testa de Nevill, pp. 61, 60. | 2 Rot. Hundred. II. 57."], [663, "199 CHERRINGTON. of half a knight's-fee, but was still a tenure -in-capite sine medio. I cannot trace this succession any further, nor yet account for the obscurity which befell it. Op Undertenants in Cherrington, Geoffrey Griffin was the most important. His feoffment must have been, at least, as early as 1230, for in that year I find him first accounting for that annual ferm of 8d. to the Exchequer for a pourpresture, which we have seen to have been in Cherrington. On the Pipe-Roll the pourpres ture is said to be of 4 acres of meadow-land, which thus became quit of Regard. Geoffrey Griffin's grants to Wombridge were stated above to have taken place in 1251. They are fully enume rated in Edward II.'s confirmation to that House. He gave all his land, with buildings, rents, and men, which he had within and without the vill, in the whole tenement of Cherinton, and with the meadow which he had from William de Eton -1 and with the meadow plough-land and pasture which he had in the fee of Ercall, and with the fishery above the bridge, and with the meadow and plough land in Gorstes, and with the meadow of Menemedewe, and the plough-land of Sidenhale and of Wetebuttes and of Yvenedich, with all appurtenances within and without the vill of Cherinton. It appears that Bertram Griffin, brother and heir of Geoffrey, confirmed all this ; for Edward II.'s Charter specifies a Quitclaim made by Bertram Griffin of all his right in Cherrington and in all lands which Geoffrey Griffin had given to Wombridge. Other Undertenants in this Manor were as follows. \u2014 Dionisius de Cherinton occurs on a Jury in 1220. Richard Bernard of Cherington occurs as a witness or a Juror from 1249 to 1274. Richard de Cherinton stands after Richard Bernard on the Jury of 1249, and is perhaps the same with Richard, son of Thomas de Cherrington, who attests a Deed about 1250.2 In 1253 we have Thomas de Cherinton on the same Inquest as Richard, Lord of Cherrington. Perhaps this was the Thomas de Cherinton who is recorded to have given half a virgate in Cherinton to Wombridge Priory. Again, William, son and heir of Adam de Cherinton, is recorded as having given two virgates, together with all his right in the fee of Cherrington, to Wombridge Priory. John le Bret son of Ralph le Bret similarly gave one virgate, with an increment of 3 acres. Lastly, Thomas de Mere conceded to Wombridge all his share in 1 * \u00b0 Vide supra, pp. 65, 92."], [664, "200 CHESTHILL. the common-pasture of Cherrington which Geoffrey Griffin had oc cupied, and of all his land wherever situated and occupied by the said Geoffrey.1 Wombridge Priory Fee. It is apparent from the above details that the Canons of Wombridge must have sooner or later obtained the best half of this Manor. However the Taxation of 1291 gives them only 3 carucates (worth 30s. per annum) here.3 In the Valor of 1535 the Prior's receipts from Cherrington are mixed with those from Tibberton, Podford, and Sherlow.

The name Chesthill is now lost, but the situation of the Manor can be nearly determined. It occupied the angle formed by the confluence of the Bailey Brook and the River Tern. It therefore 1 Monasticon, VI. p. 389. 2 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 368. 3 Monasticon, VI. 391. 4 * 5 Domesday, fos. 252, a, 2; 258, b, 2."], [665, "CHESTHILL AND TERNHILL. 201 included the place now called Tern Hill, but anciently Hulle. It extended also in a southerly direction, down along the eastern or opposite bank of the Tern, being limited by Stoke Grange on its east and Helshaw on its south. The first Tenant in capite of Chesthill whom I can name was Richard de ChesthuU. I have noticed under Uppington that he occurs from 1195 to 1214, but was deceased in 1218. The Scu tage-Rolls, already given, exhibit him as paying scutages on Chest hull from 1203 to 1214 inclusive. A Feodary of 1212 tells us that Richard de ChesthuU holds half a knight's-fee in capite of the Es cheats of Gerard de Tornai.1 Before 1218 Richard de Chesthul was apparently succeeded at ChesthuU by a son Robert, who must have been his son by an earlier wife than Isabella Mussun. But Robert de ChesthuU, though he paid the charge on the scutage of 1218, does not seem to have survived long. The accountant to the Scutage of Biham, in 1221, is a second Richard de ChesthuU. Nor can the inaccuracies as to the names of Tenants-in-capite, which pervade the later scutage-rolls of Henry III.'s time, be sus pected to exist here, for we have corroborative proof that the Lord of Chesthill in 1221 was named Richard. At the Assizes, held in November of that year, Richard de Chesthul appeared and with drew a suit which he had moved against the Abbot of Shrewsbury, concerning a stank erected by the Abbot in Winlinton (meaning Woolerton) .3 His Sureties were Thomas de Estleg (probably iden tical with Thomas de Cherrington3) and Hugh Budell. The Scutages of 1223 and 1224 are both entered on the Pipe- Roll of the latter year as chargeable on Robert de ChesthuU. I believe this to be a mere mistake, the result of the Clerk of the Pipe copying his entries from the Roll of 1218. To the Scutage of Keri, in 1229, Richard de ChesthuU is again the person assessed, and his name is the one used on seven subsequent Scutage-Rolls. This is however in turn erroneous, for, in or about the year 1228, Richard de ChesthuU sold this estate to Combermere Abbey. Hence the Aid- Roll of 1235-6 duly certifies that the Abbot of Combermere had paid one merk on half a Tournai-fee in ChesthuU.* The Abbot was, in short, the real accountant in all Scutages sub sequent to 1229.

On November 25, 1228, the Charter passed the Great Seal, which conferred on the Earl the Castle and Honour of Montgomery;1 and on January 2, 1229, an other Charter annexed to the said Castle and Honour aU the ser vices and wards which had previously been returnable at Shrawar dine, viz. that aU knights and free tenants previously accustomed to do ward at Shrawardine should do tantamount ward at Mont gomery Castle for the said Hubert and his heirs, whose tenement at Montgomery the King thus wished to augment.2 Hubert, Earl of Kent, may be taken then as Seigneural Lord of ChesthuU from 1229 till his downfall and forfeiture in 1232. His Charter confirming Richard de Chesthull's grant of Chesthulle and Hulle (Tern HU1) to Combermere is extant. He styles himself \" Earl of Kent and Justiciar of England.\" He acquits the Monks of that service of castle-guard which Richard de ChesthuU had been used to perform yearly at Montgomery for Chesthulle and Hulle, and of aU other earthly service or secular exaction. They were not to be distrained for any default in respect of any ward, scutage, relief, or murage, belonging to the Earl or his heirs.3 It is probable that on the Earl's downfall, a great part of this Charter was deemed to be ultra vires. On May 6, 1232, King Henry III. (now reseized of the Honour of Montgomery and of the Seigneury over all Tournai fees), simply confirmed ChesthuU and Hull to Combermere as given by Richard de ChesthuU, not as en franchised by Hubert de Burgh, whose name is not even men tioned.* The King's Charter sets forth the boundaries of the grant as foUows. \u2014 From the ford of Stratforde5 along the King's highway to the road called Grymbaldeswey ; along Grymbaldeswey to the Bromhock ; thence down to the boundaries of Burnhull,6 and along the said boundaries to the boundaries of Haselsewe,7 and along the said boundaries to Wolverton-Ford8 in the River Tern, and along 1 * 3 Rot.

I have endeavoured in the notes to identify some of the localities here named, but enough has been said before3 as to the general situ ation of ChesthuU Manor and its member of Hulle. The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 describes Chesthul as a Manor of three geldable hides. It records how Richard Lord of Chesthul had held it in capite for half a knight's-fee, and how he had been used to do 40 days' service at Shrawardine Castle in war-time with horse, lance, cuirass, and chapel de fer ; how also the Abbot of Combermere had purchased it from the said Richard and held it for 27 years past, and had a Charter thereof from the King. The Abbot had 6 carucates in demesne, worth 20s. per annum each, also a Fulling-mill worth 30s., and a grinding-mill worth 24s. per an num (total \u00a38. 14s.). The Manor paid 12d. stretward, and 12c.. mots ee per annum, aud did suit every three weeks to the Hundred.* This entry concludes with an estimate of the damages which would result to the Crown in 10 years from loss of ward. It does not ap pear whether loss of Castle-guard, or loss of the wardship of any heir, is meant. The context does not tally with either supposition, for the passage closes with an aUusion to an annual loss of 13 merks and 8 pence5 ; \u2014 a sum exactly equal to \u00a38. 14s., the Abbot of Combermere's gross annual receipts.

The Abbot was further questioned for having, 30 years past, withdrawn the stretward and motfee due on ChesthuU, viz. 2s. per annum. He denied the charge, and affirmed that the King was in seizin of the due. He affirmed the same of his suit to the Hundred, which he was accused of having withdrawn, and allowed that the Vill of ChesthuU was bound to attend the Sheriff's Towns twice a year, by four men and a Provost, and that the Lord of ChesthuU owed suit to the lesser Hundred Court every three weeks. The complaint was dismissed sine die. By Inquest held November 4, 1314, it was found that the Abbot of Combermere had given WUliam Ostgate a 24 years' lease of this Manor, commencing March 12, 1307, had also given Ralph Clerk a 30 years' lease of 12i acres, commencing May 27, 1305, and had given William le Walkere a 24 years' lease, of a parcel of land called Monekeshalstede, commencing September 21, 1305.

And even to this day does Longner retain a strongly marked feature of its ancient status. It is an isolated portion of the Shrewsbury Parish of St. Chad. Now, St. Chad's Church was founded, endowed, and for ages governed, by the Bishops of the Mercian Diocese ; and they threw their Manors into the Parish of St. Chad, wherever distance would permit such an arrangement.1 Domesday speaks of Longner as follows. \u2014 \" The same Bishop (of Chester) holds Languenare and Wigot holds it of him. Here is one hide. The (arable) land is (enough) for n ox-teams. In demesne there is i team; and n Serfs and n Villains have i team. The Manor was and is worth 8s.

The Feodary of 1165, known as the Liber Niger, tells of one \u2014 Geoffrey fitz Reginald, who held half a knight's-fee of old feoffment under Richard Peche, then Bishop of Coventry.3 There are very good reasons for assuming that Geoffrey fitz Reginald's tenure consisted of the Staffordshire Manors of Norton-under- Cannock, and Little Wyrley, and of the Shropshire Manor of Longner. Moreover we infer that Geoffrey fitz Reginald's ances tors had been thus enfeoffed at least 30 years before. Geoffrey fitz Reginald was living in or after the year 1203. Be tween that year aud 1206, he, as \" Geoffrey, son of Reiner de Wirley,\" gave to Haghmond Abbey half a virgate in Longenholre, of which Godwin was tenant. He gave it in exchange for a whole virgate in Wirley (Staffordshire), which his Aunt (amita) had pre viously given to the Abbey.

In this grant the Donor covenants to provide an equivalent, if he should prove unable to warrant the haE- virgate in Longner to the Abbey.1 The consent of the Grantor's heirs is also aUeged, and it would seem that William, his eldest son, was already resident at Longner. He, as \" WiUiam fitz Geoffrey of Longenhalre,\" con firmed his Father's grant of half a virgate to Haghmon, by a Deed which, from the close similarity of its testing-clause, must have followed immediately after the original grant. William fitz Geoffrey, on succeeding to his father's estates, probably continued to reside in Shropshire. As early as 1199 he had married Dionisia, one of the coheiresses of Roger Mussun of Uppington, and widow of Roger Bochart of Bourton and PuUey. The story of this marriage has been amply told already.3 WiUiam fitz Geoffrey, at his decease in 1223, left no issue ; but his wife Dionisia survived him. In October of that year Dionisia, widow of WiUiam fitz Geoffrey, was suing WiUiam de Duston for one third of the vill of Longenhalre, which third she claimed in dower. WiUiam de Duston not appearing, the said third was, as usual, seized in manu Regis tUl the foUowing Law-term.3 I must now turn back some years to say who William de Duston, or rather who WiUiam de Duston's father was, and to show that it was as Tenant-in-possession of Longner, that the son was sued by Dionisia Mussun. William de Duston (I.) had been a person of some notoriety and some success in the reign of John. I find him in the imme diate employment and pay of that King in 1213, and thenceforward tiU August 1215, when he lost his most important office, viz. that of Custos of Scarborough Castle. In this trust he was succeeded by WUliam de Harcourt, under whom, as we shaU see, he held several estates in Staffordshire. In December 1215 we find that WUUam de Duston was in rebeUion, and his Suzerain, Harcourt, was empowered by King John to take seizin of his lands at Ran ton and Halop (Staffordshire). His estates in Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Leicestershire, and Warwickshire, were entrusted to Hugh de Nevill. I find a Writ of April 28, 1216, empowering WiUiam de Harcourt still to hold the vill of Mes (Milnmeese, Staffordshire), and other fees, Haughmond Chartulary, so. 141.

WiUiam de Duston continued in rebeUion tiU the end of John's reign, but on October 13, 1217, a Writ of Henry III. certifies that he had returned to his allegiance and was to be repossessed of his estates in several of the Counties already named, and also in Kent, Cambridgeshire, Surrey, Wiltshire, and Shropshire.1 From thence till May 1218 several Writs show William de Duston to have been in favour with the young King, but on September 7, 1218, he was dead. He left a son and heir, WiUiam, and a daughter, Joan. Thus much I have said of WiUiam de Duston (I.), in amplifica tion of a former note on the same subject.2 The estates which he held in Shropshire and Staffordshire fall under two classes, viz. those which he acquired by feoffment of Thomas Noel, and held under WiUiam de Harcourt (Noel's Coheir), and those which he acquired by feoffment of William fitz Geoffrey, and held under the said William fitz Geoffrey at his decease in 1218. Of the former class were Ranton, Milnmeese, and Holm, of the latter were Littlc- Wyrley, Norton, and Langenorle (i. e. Longner) . On September 7, 1218, the King seized on these six estates, till such time as the Crown-debts of WiUiam de Duston, deceased, should be satisfied.3 In October 1218 an estate in Nottinghamshire, bequeathed to Joan de Dunston by her late Father, was given up to her.4 A Writ of June 1219 shows that WiUiam de Duston's son and heir was, as yet, under age.5 However the said heir was identical with that WUliam de Duston whom we have seen impleaded in 1223, by his Suzerain's Widow, for a third of Longner. We conclude therefore that \u2014 William de Duston (II.) was now of age. I must here quote a very remarkable statement which, whether I can explain it or not, belongs undoubtedly to our present subject. I find an alleged copy of a Deed wherein Alicia Mauvesin is said to have quitclaimed to WiUiam de Duston all the claim which she had made against him concerning the land of her husband, viz. \" a third part of Nortune, a third part of Wivell' , and a third part of Longnobre p' Nortune.\" The quitclaim is only for her Use, the premises being heretofore claimed by her, only as dower.6 That this Deed has been most inaccurately transcribed will be 4 \u25a0 5 Claus.

That the explanation offered of it by its Transcriber is most inadequate, and in some parts most mistaken, I am fully convinced. It is a daring liberty to take with a professed transcript, even if inaccurate ; \u2014 but I cannot help suggesting that the Lady called Alicia Mauvesin was Dionisia Mussun, and that the estates concerned were, Norton under Cannock, Little Wirley, and Longner. On any other suppo sition I cannot explain this Deed. William de Duston (II.) certainly succeeded at some time to the fee-simple of Longner; \u2014 holding it however under Thomas fitz Geoffrey, as next brother and heir of William fitz Geoffrey, its former Lord, while the said Thomas held immediately of the see of Lichfield. We shall presently see that Thomas fitz Geoffrey abrogated his mesne rights at Longner and Wirley, so that the heirs of Duston came to hold both Manors immediately of the Bishops of Lichfield. On August 1231, William de Duston (II.) was deceased. Ste phen de Segrave gave the King ,\u20ac100 for custody of his lands and heirs, and for the disposal of the latter in marriage. As to William de Dunston's heirs I can say little of my own knowledge. I will therefore copy what Erdeswick has said of this family and succession, merely enclosing in a parenthesis the one statement which I know to be erroneous. \u2014 \"William Dinston had issue (by Joan Noel, his wife) William Dinston, who had issue one daughter and heir, Roisia, married to Sir John D'Oyley, who had issue by her John D'Oyley, who had issue Joan, his daughter and heir, married to Sir Thomas Lewknor, knight.\"1 Accepting then Roisia as the eventual sole heir of William de Duston (II.) we shall now hear what occurred during her minority with respect to the two Manors of Longner and Wirley. \u2014 By a Deed or Deeds, which must have passed between September 22, 1231, and November 12, 1234, Thomas fitz Geoffrey of Longe nalre quitclaims to his Lord Alexander, Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, the whole service which William de Duston had been bound and accustomed to render to his (Thomas's) father and to himself, for the land of Longenarle which they (Thomas and his father) had held of the Bishop in capite. He further quitclaims the whole service which the said William de Duston had rendered for the land of Wyrley, which land Thomas and his father had used to hold of the Bishop in capite by one-fourth of a knight's-fee.

They probably held both Long ner and Wyrley of the See of Lichfield, and both were living in October 1255. At Longner they enfeoffed that family of Haugh tons, of whom I have made mention under Cleobury North and under Withington. This feoffment was probably immediately after Roisia obtained possession of Longner, for I suppose the Deed must have passed between 1227 and 1236, whereby \" Ralph, Abbot of Haghmon, gives to Robert, Lord of Halichton, a life-lease of that half-virgate which the Abbey had in Longenhalre, for 6s. rent.

This I learn from a Deed whereby Michael de Burgo re leases to Dame Roese D'OyUy, and to John her son, all his right in a virgate at Raunton.2 The Inquest on Thomas de Halghton's death in 1282, has been already set forth.3 Well and intelligibly does it state that he had held Longenholre under Roe's D'Oyly, for a rent of 12d. per annum. The Manor was estimated to contain 2 carucates of land. So too the Inquest taken in 1304, on the death of Robert de Halghton (III.), says that he had held 2 carucates in Longenolre under John de Doyle, by service of 12d. rent. I shall conjecture nothing, for I know nothing, of any subsequent interests of the Bishops of Lichfield as Seigneural Lords, of D'Oyley or Lewknor, as Mesne Lords, or of De Haughton as Tenant-in-fee of Longner. 1 Dugdale's MSS.

Godebald's Church-estates wiU have been held by an extraordi nary tenure, if, as there is reason to believe, they passed at his de cease to his (necessarUy iUegitimate) son, Robert. From Godebald and his said son they went to the first Richard de Belmeis; \u2014 to him, whose career, as Bishop of London and Viceroy of Shropshire, we have already traced under Tong. What now concerns us is that at his death, on January 16, 1127, the Bishop was seized of the Deanery or chief Prebendal interest in the Church of St. Alk mund. The Bishop's elder Nephew and temporal heir, Philip de Belmeis, became at his death, Lord of Tong. His younger Nephew, Rich ard, was not yet of age, but was already destined for the Church. We have seen that about the year 1139 Philip de Belmeis was interested in the prosperity of the Savigniac Abbey of Buildwas, recently founded by Bishop Roger de Clinton.1 The manner in which he encouraged that establishment, and his own- personal ad mission into the fraternity of Savigni, preclude all idea of his having a cotemporary admiration for any other Religious Order. Before many years had passed, specifically before the year 1145, Philip de Belmeis was of another mind. The introduction into England of Regular, as distinct from Secular, Canons, belongs to no earlier period than the reign of Henry I., and, according to one account, the elder Richard de Belmeis had been instrumental, about a.d. 1108, to their first settlement in this country.3 During the next thirty years, many Colleges of Secular Canons were changed into Regulars, and many Houses of Regulars were newly founded. In theLateran CouncU of 1139, all Regular Canons, throughout the dominions of St. Peter, were subjected to the specific rule of Saint Augustine ; but there was a sect of Regulars which had long previously professed an improvement on its fundamental ordinances, and which, from its first House having been dedicated to St. Ni cholas of Arras, and having been situated near that city, was called Arroasian. A number of these latter Canons are said to have been introduced into England in 1140, under the auspices oi Alexander the Magnificent, Bishop of Lincoln. They were domiciled at Dor chester, in Oxfordshire, once the episcopal seat of Alexander's pre- gate London. Vide Monasticon (Caley b ,-\u00bb.- & ElUs), Vol. A I. pp. 150-165. , _, ,m -iTTT _. Q9 .

Within five, probably within three, years of this date, the Dor chester Canons were ready to increase their influence by emigration. Some of them fouud their way into Shropshire, where Philip de Belmeis was their first Patron. I have already given the Charter of the said Philip, and described the locality which it assigned for the residence of these Canons,1 viz. that part of the Manor of Tong which is now known as the Lizard Grange.2 LILLESHALL ABBEY. The Arroasian Canons, though introduced into Shropshire under no greater patronage than that of an influential Knight, were des tined for greater things. Before I pass to the next event which befell them, I must resume my account of \u2014 Richard de Belmeis (II.), brother of the Lord of Tong and younger Nephew of Richard de Belmeis (I.), Bishop of London. When that Prelate had been dead about seven months, that is, in August 1127, King Henry I. is known to have been waiting on the coast of Hampshire for a favourable opportunity of crossing the Channel. Doubtless to this period belongs the Charter, dated at Portsmouth, whereby the King granted to Richard de Belmeis, ne phew of Richard Bishop of London, \" aU the Churches, Lands, and things,\" which having in the first instance been held by Godebald and Robert his son, had since been held under the King by the late Bishop.8 1 Supra, Vol. II. pp. 204, 205. meis's Leicestershire grants to Lilleshall, says nothing about his grant of the Lizard Grange, but treats the latter as the gift of Walter de Dunstanville ; \u2014 Ex dono JVal teri de Dunstanvile, terram de Lusard cum molendino et vivariis inter duo ne mora de Lusard et Bretvud (Ibidem, so. 87). 2 It seems that the Lizard Grange was was not so clearly in Tong Manor as my former account would imply. At all events the Canons of Lilleshall thought it neces sary to get an independent grant thereof from the first Walter de Dunstanville, Lord of Idsall. As Walter de Dunstan vill he gives to the Abbey \" all his land of Lusard which was between Watling street and Meredich and the two rivulets.\" This he did \"for the souls of his father and mother.\" He gave it \" wholly, with the Vivary and Mill which were between the aforesaid land and the forest.\" (Lilles hall Chartulary, so. 60.)

Richard de Belmeis, whom we may now call Chief Prebendary of St. Alkmund' s, was at this time hardly of age. He was nevertheless a Dignitary of St. Paul's, London, and had actually been appointed Archdeacon of Middlesex by his Uncle, several years before. His extreme youth, however, had induced an arrangement, whereby one Hugh, a Chaplain, had custody of the Archdeaconry, to hold, in commendam as it were, till Belmeis should attain a fitting age. This period arrived during the episcopacy of Gilbert the Universal (January 11 28- August 1134); \u2014 but the Archdeacon in possession forgot or evaded his oath; and his refusal to resign his trust was countenanced by Bishop Gilbert. The death of the latter Prelate was followed by a long vacancy in the See of London. In 1138 Anselm had been elected to the See, but his election was opposed by the Chapter of St. Paul's, and Belmeis was sent to Rome as the Representative of the said Chapter's opposition. The appeal suc ceeded, and now Belmeis brought under the consideration of the Pontiff (Innocent II.) his own personal grievance in regard to the Archdeaconry of Middlesex. This matter the Pope referred back to the scrutiny and decision of two English Bishops (Hereford and Lincoln) , and they, before the end of the year, gave sentence in fa vour of Belmeis. In apparent connection with his induction to the Archdeaconry, Belmeis was ordained Deacon in December 1138, by Henry, Bishop of Winchester, at command of the Papal Legate, Alberic, who was then visiting England. In June or July, 1141, we have seen that Richard de Belmeis, Archdeacon of Middlesex, was in the Court of the Empress at Ox ford, and attested her Charter to Haughmond Abbey.1 It was the era of her pride and triumph ; for Stephen was then her prisoner. The release of Stephen, towards the close of the same year, again set the kingdom in a blaze. PoUtical parties were once more re vived or confounded, and each man readjusted his allegiance as duty, interest, or passion might direct. Amidst all the turmoil and distrust we may again notice, and again wonder, at the impulse which was given to religious institutions.

Meantime there were men whose conduct, favour ably interpreted, would indicate that they kept clear of political parties, and of whom the worst that can be said is that they adhered to each party in turn, according as it might suit their designs ; \u2014 designs, I mean, not of rapine or bloodshed, but of peace and bene volence. These men pursued their ends without apparent molesta tion, nay, often with double encouragement. Among them was Richard, Archdeacon of Middlesex, who, whe ther at the suggestion of his brother PhUip, or in sympathy with the Bishop of Lincoln, selected the Arroasian Order for his munifi cent favour. His first step, taken, I doubt not, in 1144, was to transfer the Dorchester emigrants from the Lizard-Grange to Don nington-Wood, \u2014 a part of his prebendal estate of Lilleshall, not six miles distant from their first abode. This he did, doubtless, with a fuU assurance of those consents, temporal as well as ecclesi astical, which foUowed upon, and were necessary to, his act. We know that, in the spring of 1145, Stephen was occupied in Norfolk and Suffolk; we know that, at the same time, Imarus, Bishop of Tusculum, was in England as Legate of Pope Lucius IL, who died during his deputy's embassy, viz. on February 26, 1145. This then is the proximate date of a Charter,2 whereby King Ste phen, then at Bury St. Edmund's, \" consenting to the prayer of Archdeacon Richard, grants and concedes to the Canons Regular of Duninton, the Prebend which the said Richard had in the Church of St. Alchmund at Salopesbury, and all his demesnes and stock (res) ; and moreoyer all the other Prebends of the aforesaid Church, whenever they should faU vacant.\"3 The first witness of this Charter was \" Imarus Bishop of Tusculum, Legate,\" the se cond Robert (de Betun), Bishop of Hereford. Besides them, Ro troc, Bishop of Evreux; Robert de Gant, Stephen's Chancellor; Earls William de Warren, Gilbert de Clare, and Alberic (de Vere) ; also WilUam de Ipres and Henry de Essex attested the Charter.

I know not that it wiU be extravagant to as sociate his nonconcurrence with a very natural feeling of jealousy in behalf of his own foundation of Buildwas, which had already been brought into a kind of rivalry by PhUip de Belmeis's adoption of the Arroasian Canons in preference to the Savigniac Monks. The further course of feelings and events must be deduced from general observations. In March 1145, Eugenius III. succeeded to the chair of St. Peter. Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln, the great Patron of the Arroasians, was in especial favour with that Pontiff. He visited him at Rome, in 1145-6, and again at Auxerre in 1147. Within this interval (1145-7) Roger Bishop of Chester received and obeyed the Pope's Order to confirm Richard de Belmeis's en dowment of the Donnington Canons. Bishop CUnton's Charter is not preserved, but we know the facts of its passing and of its pass ing in obedience to a Papal mandate, from a succeeding and further confirmatory Charter of Theobald, Archbishop of Canterbury, which is preserved, and which records both circumstances.1 Archbishop Theobald's Charter bears no appearance of having been written in exUe. Probably therefore it passed before April 1148, when Stephen banished him for attending the Council of Rheims. The way in which Bishop Clinton is mentioned by the Archbishop is further auxihary to determining this question of date. He is mentioned as if living. Now Bishop Clinton died at Antioch on April 16, 1148, and Theobald must must have first heard of the event during his own exile. The Charter of Archbishop Theobald, written then in or before the year 1148, indicates one, if not two changes, which had taken place since Stephen's Charter of 1145. It speaks of Belmeis's en dowment as intended for the building of an Abbey in honour of the Holy Virgin and in the Wood of Lilleshull. Thither therefore had the Arroasian Canons at length removed, viz. to a site three miles distant from their second abode in Donnington Wood. In this third domicile they remained. Lilleshall Abbey was therefore com menced between the years 1144 and 1148. Archbishop Theobald's Charter also calls Richard de Belmeis Dean of St. Alkmund' s? and describes his prebendal estate as that 2 The name of the Dean of St. Alk mund's at the close of Henry I.'s reign, and probably at the commencement of Stephen's, was Adam (see Monasticon, VII. 750, No. XII.). 1 The original Deed, with a perfect and probably unique seal of Archbishop Theo bald, is among the Duke of Sutherland's muniments at Trentham. A copy thereof is printed Monasticon, VI. p. 263."], [680, "216 LILLESHALL. of Lilleshull and Hetingeham (Atcham). If Belmeis had only re cently been made Dean of St. Alkmund's, and such probably was the case, it was obviously that he might have every facility for con verting the Secular into the Regular establishment, a business which we know to have been substantively and eventually completed. Thus, whether in Belmeis's time or later, all the prebendal estates of St. Alkmund's became the property of the Canons of Lilleshall. The next Charter which I should notice, is the Confirmation of the Empress Matilda to Lilleshall Abbey. This interesting document seems to me to have passed very soon after she quitted England, that is in 1148; but I must speak of it with caution, as its nearly obliterated condition makes some of the words, which I fancy my self to have deciphered, somewhat problematical. \u2014 \"Matilda the Empress, daughter of King Henry,\" addresses William fitz Alan and Walter (perhaps his brother) and all her faith ful of Shropshire, with greeting. She receives \" William Abbot of Lylleshull, and the Canons there serving God, for the souls of Henry her Father, Matilda her mother, &c. &c, and for the welfare of himself and hers, under her tulelage and protection. Wherefore her will and mandate is that the aforesaid WiUiam and his Canons should hold all their possessions freely and peaceably, viz. the Church of St. Alkmund of Salop, with its appurtenances and fran chises, already confirmed to them by Episcopal authority. The witnesses seem to be H. (Hugh) Archbishop of Rouen; Joceline Bishop of Sarum ; Philip Bishop of Baieux ; Richard the Empress's Chancellor ; Robert de Curcy ; William de AnsgerviU.\" The Deed is dated, I think, at Falaise.1 We now pass to the Confirmation of Walter Durdent, Bishop of Coventry (consecrated October 2, 1149). It seems to me to have passed soon after his consecration, and before September 1152,2 when Richard de Belmeis, whom it names as Dean of St. Alkmund's, became Bishop of London. His conversion of the Secular Pre bends is spoken of as a thing done. The building of the Abbey of St. Mary in the wood of LUleshull has commenced. The previous sanctions of King Stephen, Pope Eugenius, Archbishop Theobald, and Bishop Clinton, are each alluded to. The Charter is attested 1 Lilleshall Chartulary (in possession of the Duke of Sutherland), so. 44. in 1153, viz. \"when Pelton Abbey was founded.\" There is however a strong counter-presumption that the foundation of Pelton was earlier than 1153. If so, the objection to dating Walter Durdent's Charter earlier than 1153 is invalid. 2 There is an objection to this early date. One of the witnesses is Geoffrey Abbot of (-'umbermere.

It merely confirms to the Canons the Church of St. Alkmund with soe and sac and all the privileges which that Church had enjoyed in the time of Henry I. It is attested by Arnulf, Bishop of Liseux, (Humphrey) de Bohun, Walcheline Maminot, William fitz Hamon, Warin fitz Gerold, Richard fitz Haldebrond, and Manasser Biset. It is dated at Ar gentan, in Normandy, and passed probably in 1151.3 The same Prince's Charter, after he ascended the throne, is a document of some historical interest. He confirms all things, viz. the site of the Abbey and the Church of St. Alkmund according to the former Charter of his \" Lady the Empress \" (a mode of desig nating his mother, which I have not elsewhere met with) . The Deed is attested by R? (Robert), Bishop of Lincoln, R. (Richard), Bishop of London; Thomas, the Chancellor; Manasser Biset, steward ; Warin fitz Gerold, chamberlain ; Robert de Dunstanvill, and Joceline de Baliol.5 It is dated Apud Alrewas in exercitu, a circumstance which, with the witnesses' names, proves the Deed to have passed in the first year of Henry's reign, though the month is left uncertain.6 A cotemporary precept of the same King gives the Canons of Lilleshall a new privilege, viz. an exemption from toll and passage throughout the King's dominions, under a penalty of \u00a310, recoverable from any one who should charge them with such dues.7 I may now close my account of the Foundation of Lilleshall Abbey, with a summary of whatever is further known of its Founder. Richard de Belmeis (II.), notwithstanding his ecclesiastical mandy,\" but he is known to have used his other titles before his accession to the throne of England. The presumption is that he used them as they accrued. 1 Monasticon, VI. 263, No. IV. 2 Chartulary (ut supra), so. 44. 3 This date I assign on the following grounds. Henry became Duke of Nor mandy early in 1151, by cession of his father, Geoffrey. In the Autumn of that year he became also Earl of Aujou by his father's death; and in 1152 he acquired further titles by his marriage with Eleanor of Poitou. In the Deed before us, he simply styles himself \"Duke of Nor- 4 The name Richard stands here in the Chartulary.

His Consecration followed at Canterbury on Sunday, September 28, 1152, Archbishop Theobald officiating, and nearly every English Bishop attending. Henry of Winchester, the only notable absentee, sent a message to the Synod, excusing his attendance, but expressing in high terms his assent to Belmeis' promotion. \u2014 Elegance of person, polished manners, in dustrious activity, and scientific accomplishment, are all attributed to the new Bishop by his great Panegyrist, who predicted that \" the tree, now to be planted in God's temple, would, with divine help, flourish and be fruitful.\" Such was the pious tone assumed by Henry of Blois, who, though not as yet sated with ambition and state-craft, gave after-evidence that he sometimes spoke both so lemnly and sincerely. Richard de Belmeis, Bishop of London, seems to have been a party to the negotiations which, in 1153, gave peace to the dis tracted nation, by settling the succession on Henry, Duke of Nor mandy. On December 19, 1154, he attended the coronation of that Prince at Westminster. I find him occasionally but not often at Court in 1155 ; and Prince Henry, who was born at London on February 28th of that year, was baptized by Bishop Belmeis. The next year the King was in Normandy ; but a Court held at Col chester on May 24, 1157, was attended by Belmeis. Not again, at any later period, do I hear of him in public, or in attendance on the King. He died on the 4th of May 1162, having been many years a sufferer from some disorder, which, as one of the Chroniclers informs us,1 deprived him of speech. His Uncle, the former Bishop of London, was, as we know, attacked by paralysis many years be fore his death, and the Nephew's malady was, I suspect, of a simi lar nature. His age at his death must have been considerably less than sixty. No record remains of his having done anything for the fabric of the Church of St. Paul's, the Cathedral of his See. His whole cares of this kind were probably devoted to the completion of that Augustine Abbey of which we are speaking. It was associated with the neighbouring heritage of his kinsmen, and with the me mories of his own early advancement ; it was situated also in the County which had nursed the greater genius and fortunes of his iUustrious Uncle. 1 John Hagustald, p. 278."], [689, "219 THE ABBEY. Of the various Confirmations which mark the growing prosperity of Lilleshall Abbey, that of Pope Alexander III. (1159-1181) is the first to be noticed. It receives Abbot William and his brethren under the Papal protection according to the example of Pope Eu genius. It confirms the Church of St. Alkmund with its Prebends, which it enumerates. They were Lilleshull, Ettingham (Atcham), Ukington, Longedon, Edbricteleg (Albright-lee), Hennecot, Preston (Preston Gubbalds), Lee (near Pimhill), Cherlton (near Shawbury), DinthiU, Wiluuredeschot, and nine acres in a second Cherlton.1 Among other Benefactions to the Abbey it only notices those of Philip de Belmeis and of Walter de Dunstanvill of Idsall. It ex empts the Novalia of the Canons from tithes, in the form already noticed under Haughmond and Wombridge. Other Papal Privilegia (as they are termed in the Chartulary) were as follows.\u2014 Pope Urban II. (1185-1187) ratified the Charter of his Predecessor, Alexander. Innocent III. (1198-1216) ex empted the Abbey from the observance of Interdicts. The Con firmation of Pope Honorius III. (1216-1227) enumerates various additions to the wealth of the Abbey by grants of private persons. It was also at this time in receipt of rents from Shrewsbury, Ches ter, Stafford, and Worcester. In this Bull the Pontiff gives to the Canons in the usual form, the right to elect their future Abbots. Three other rescripts of Honorius III. are preserved in the Lille shaU Chartulary. One guarantees the Papal protection ; another does the same, speaking of the possessions secured to the Abbey by King John, of illustrious memory ; a third forbids the Canons to confer on any person, or to convert to other than the existing uses, any Prebend of St. Alkmund's. The Chartulary contains some other Papal Privileges; but I shall here notice only one, which I take to be by Pope Innocent III., though it is undated. It allows that a Canon of the House may undertake the cure of souls in any Parish Church of the Abbot's gift : and that two, three, or four of the Canons, living in any such sed nesciunt quo waranto.

Of Regal Confirmations to LUleshall the most full and remark able are/that of King John, dated August 31, 1199, that of Henry III., dated November 29, 1265, that of Edward I., dated June 7, 1285, that of Richard IL, dated November 4, 1394, and that of Henry VIII., dated April 5, 1524. King John's Charter, I should observe, makes mention of Preston-Montford, and Wistanstow, as possessions of St. Alkmund's. It gives to the Canons these fran chises, viz. soe, sac, tol, them, infengenthef, and utfengenthef ; also it acquits them of Geld, Danegeld, suits of Counties and Hundreds, waste, forest-regard, army-aids, aids to Sheriffs or their Serjeants, of stretward, hidage, pleas and plaints pertaining to County, and of all secular services, saving such as might be reserved in the Char ters of any of the Canons' Suzerains. They were also to be quit of toll, passage, tolls of bridges, ways, ferries, or sea-voyages, and of all tolls at fairs throughout the kingdom (except in the City of London) ; and in respect of such goods as could be proved to belong to themselves or to have been purchased for their uses. We know from the cotemporary Pipe-Roll that this ample Charter cost the Abbot of Lilleshall 30 merks. Among the Archiepiscopal Confirmations to Lilleshall Abbey, the Chartulary preserves an extraordinary series, viz. Charters of Arch bishops Theobald, Thomas a Becket, Richard (1174-1184), Bald win (1184-1190), Hubert Walter, and Stephen Langton. The continuous favour of the Bishops of Lichfield is testified by Charters or Confirmations of Walter Durdent, Richard Peche, Hugh de Novant, Alexander de Stavenby, and others. As to private bene factions, several Baronial Houses contributed to the prosperity of Lilleshall Abbey. I may name Fitz Alan, Le Strange, Dunstanvill, Pantulf, La Zouche, Trusbutt, and Erdington. The enumeration of less noted benefactors I leave to the specific localities concerned. The Shropshire Pipe- Roll of 1199 shows the Canons of Lilleshull as fining 20s. for license to cultivate 5 acres of a certain moor near their House ,- also as promising a Donum of 5 merks, as a supple ment to a Tallage of the King's Boroughs. On the Roll of 1200 the Sheriff claims a deduction in the Corpus Comitatiis of 20s. in quietantid terrarum Abbatis de Lillishull hoc anno. The entry is not referable to anything which could properly"], [691, "221 THE ABBEY. be made an item of this portion of the Sheriff's account. The passage is underlined in the original Pipe-Roll, from which I infer that a coeval objection was taken to the validity of the deduction. The Pipe- Roll of 1212 again exhibits the Canons of Lillishull as fining and paying 20s. for cultivation of 5 acres ;\u2014 of forest land, I presume. In 1242, the Pipe- Roll shows the Abbot of LUleshull as receiving a Royal gratuity of 20 merks. In August 1245 King Henry III., passing from Brug to Chester, journeyed by Wenlock, Shrewsbury, Lilleshull, and Combermere. In the same year the Abbot of Lille shull contributed 40s. towards the Aid on marriage of the Princess Royal. In 1249 the Abbot of LUleshull contributed 10 merks (\u00a36. 13s. 4d.) to an auxilium ,* the Abbot of Shrewsbury's quota being \u00a313. 6s. 8d., the Abbot of Haghmon's \u00a38, the Abbot of Wigmore's \u00a35, the Prior of Chirbury's \u00a32. 13s. 4d., and the Prior of Wombridge's \u00a31. In 1251 the Canons of Lilleshill were charged \u00a31 for two years' rent of 23 acres of lands, assarted by them in the boses of Lilleshill and Haweman. Between the years 1241 and 1248 a question of Forest-law, curious rather than important, was decided in favour of Lilleshall Abbey. It was whether the dogs on the Abbot's several estates were liable to the well-known process of expeditation. John Biset, Justice of the Forest, is known to have visited Shropshire in 1240, and to have died about August 1241. In this interval he issued an order to Sir Hugh fitz Robert, Forester of Shropshire, to dis- train certain Jurors to make Inquest on the above matter. The Inquest was held, probably in 12-12, before Roger de Pyvelesdon, then Sheriff of Salop and Stafford, before the said Sir Hugh fitz Robert, and before two Verderers, viz. Sir Richard de Leighton and Roger de Appeley. The eleven Jurors {Hugh de Leeg, Robert de Wodecote, William de Etton, Robert de Kakinton (Caynton), Richard de Ireland, Robert Forester of WeUington, Ralph de Staunton, Roger de Halghton, John de Hales, Reginald de Hales, and Ranulph de Rodington} returned a verdict in favour of the Abbot's immunity, because his lands had anciently been of the Royal demesne. This verdict was actually recorded and ratified in Ed ward I.'s Confirmation of 1285. By Patent of March 8, 1280, Edward I. allows the Abbot of Lylleshull to assart his bosc of Lylleshull, situated within the Forest of Wombridge, and containing 30 acres."], [692, "222 LILLESHALL. An undated, but early, Rent-RoU of Lilleshall Abbey, would in- dicate an income of more than \u00a3100 per annum, exclusive of appropriated Rectories. From the Manor of Lilleshall itself the receipts in Michaelmas Term were \u00a37. 8s. 2d., including Is. 8d. which came from Horton. At Midlent the same Manor yielded \u00a36. 17s. exclusive of Is. 8d. from Horton. The Taxation of 1291 gives a very inadequate idea of the Abbot of LUleshall's income. He derived \u00a310. 10s. per annum from the following estates in the Deaneries of Salop and Newport, viz. Cherleton, Time, Cold Hatton, Bonigale, and the Lizard Grange. But this computation excludes all the prebendal estates of St. Alk mund's, except Cherleton. In fact it extends chiefly to estates ac- quired from other sources. \u2014 His estate at Greenlowe (Derbyshire) yielded an annual income of \u00a35 7 0 That at Freseley (Warwickshire) yielded ..730 His Leicestershire estates (Ashby, &c.) yielded 8 15 10 From Hkyndon (or Arkendon) in Yorkshire he had 4 0 0 1 This is all that the Taxation says of the Temporalities of Lille- shall Abbey.

In 1292 the Abbot of LUleshull was impleaded by the King as to his warranty for holding Pleas-of-the-Crown, and exercising rights of Fair, Market, and Free-warren, in his Manors of Lille shull, Bolynghull, Longedon, Atton Colde, Okynton, Attingeham, Hennecote, Atbrightelegh, Preston Gobald, Preston Moneford, and DonthuU. The Abbot appeared and stated that he held no Market in the said vills. A three days' Fair at Attingeham, held on the day of St. GUes and two following days (i. e. September 1, 2, and 3), he justified by Charter of Henry III. His Free Warren, in Colde Hatton, Okynton (Uckington), Hennecote, and Longedon, was exercised under Charters of Edward I. As to Bolynghull and At ton Colde, he said that \" there was no such vill in the County.\" The Sheriff corroborated the statement and the Plea was admitted ; \u2022a strange circumstance, when accuracy of spelling was little studied, and punctuation almost unknown. As to holding Pleas of the Crown twice in a year in the other vills, the Abbot justified 1 Pope Nich.

The King's Attorney here attempted to show a dis crepancy between the Abbot's two Pleas, \" for if the privileges in question were conveyed by Charter of King John, then the previous usage was an usurpation;\" but the Attorney denied \"that King John's Charter was sufficient to divest the Crown of the privileges in question, inasmuch as it did not specifically name them.\"1 The cause was adjourned, but we may venture to guess that the sophis- tical argument of the Lawyer did not eventually prevail. In January 1321 Edward II. prosecuted the Abbot of Lilleshall for claiming immunities from toll, wharfage, and other dues, in the City of London. The Abbot failed to appear, and probably with good reason, for King John's Charter would not have served him here.

Chartulary, we are able to form an almost perfect list of these Abbots. William, probably the first Abbot of Lilleshall, occurs about 1148. He was living after the consecration of Richard Peche to the See of Lichfield, i. e. after April 1161. Some lists state him to have been living about 1173-4. I think it very probable that that was the later limit of his career. Walter, Abbot of Lilleshall, is said to have been party to an agreement with Richard de Cherlton in 1177. He was certainly Abbot in 1180 and in October 1200. His infirm state in June 1200 has been already noticed.1 A suit, which he commenced, could not be proceeded with in October 1203 owing to his death.2 At this date \u2014 Ralph was Abbot of LilleshaU.3 He was stiU Abbot in July 1216. N. is given as the initial letter of the Abbot's name in the con firmation of Pope Honorius III. (1216-1227) ? Alan occurs as Abbot in 1220, in October 1221, and in Novem ber 1224. On his death, as I suppose, but certainly on May 4, 1226, the King, by Patent, assents to the election of \u2014 William de Dorleng as Abbot of Lilleshall. He was deceased on July 27, 1 235, which is the date of the King's license for the election of his successor. On August 9, 1235, the King ratifies the election of \u2014 Simon de Fodring (probably Fotheringay), late Prior. On De cember 3, 1240, the Abbacy was vacant, and on December 14, the Royal assent was given to the election of \u2014 Richard de Salop, a Canon of the House. He occurs as Abbot in 1242, 1249, and on June 25, 1252. On June 15, 1253, the King assents to the election of \u2014 Robert de Arkalaw as Abbot. He was still in office on July 8, 1261. He is said to have been \"summoned to Parliament in 49 Henry III.\"5 (1264-5), which means, I suppose, that the then Abbot of Lilleshull was one of those who were summoned \"to consult with Simon de Montfort \" by the Pseudo-Patent of De- 4 The letter N. is often used in old documents, as a symbol, and may here mean nothing more than the Abbot then in office.

The same authority speaks of Abbot Robert as being similarly summoned to Parliament in 56 Hen. III. (1271-2), but this is more than a mere error of description, for on November 20, 1270, custody of the Abbey, then vacant, was entrusted by Patent to the Convent, which fined 20 merks for the privilege. On November 30, 1270, the Royal assent was given to the election of\u2014 William de Hales, late Prior, who had the temporalities re stored to him by a third Patent of December 16, 1270. He occurs as Abbot in 1272, 1273, and 1275. Lucas occurs as Abbot in 1277, and in November 1282. Ralph was Abbot in March 1284,1 and in March 1289. John is said in one list to have been Abbot in 18 Edward I. (1289-90), but I doubt the accuracy of this.2 William de Brugge was Abbot in November 1291, and in June 1306. On February 28, 1308, he had resigned ; and though the election of \u2014 John de Chetwynd, a Canon, was found to be informal by the Bishop, he confirmed it, to prevent the Escheator's continued inter ference with the vacant Abbey.

I do not suppose that LUleshall was one of the Saxon Parishes of this district, but in what Saxon Parish the Manor should be placed it is hard to determine. Idsall, which certainly included Sheriff- Hales in its Parish, perhaps involved Lilleshall, but no traces of such subjection in the latter instance are likely to exist. That the Canons of Lilleshall found a Parish Church in existence when they entered on the Manor, I cannot doubt. That it was a Rectory is also apparent ; for Bishop Richard Peche granted them an appropriation of the three Churches of St. Alcmund's, Atting ham, and LUleshall.1 H. (that is, Hugh de Novant) Bishop of Coventry, granted a similar Ucense of appropriation in respect of the Parish Church of LUleshaU.2 In consequence of the perpetual strifes which arose between the Monastic Rectors and the Vicar of Lilleshall, Bishop Roger de Molend, on March 5, 1286, assigned a fixed portion for the Vicar.

Some Lilla, a Saxon settler, had left his name with both village and hill ; I say hill, for the older way of spelling the name, viz. Lilleshull, is undoubtedly more correct than Lilleshall. The Forest-Roll of 1180 affords an early illustration of this matter of nomenclature. The Abbot of Lilleshull is assessed 12s. for imbladements of 7^ acres of corn and 7 acres of oats. His Tenants (homines) in Lilleshull are assessed 11s. for similar im bladements. Again, the Vitiate of Lilleston is assessed one merk for a pourpresture, viz. a Mill; and this entry is followed by a charge of 1 2d. against one Morinus for a pourpresture in Dunniton (i. e. Donnington Wood) . In a case of murder, presented by the Bradford Jurors at the Assizes of 1203, we have the name of this Manor spelt as Lilleshill or Lilleshul. \u2014 Elyas de LiUeshill, Alice Crithebrech, Eva de Lileshil, Aldet, Mable, Geoffrey, and Robert de Lilleshul, and Peter de Hopton, were accused of murdering a woman at Lilleshill. Elyas had taken sanctuary in the Church of Lilleshill, but had since ac knowledged the murder and abjured the realm. Alice, immediately after the murder, had fled into Staffordshire with certain chattels of the murdered woman, had been there arrested, and brought back into Shropshire. Her defence before the Curia Comitatus of Salop was now recorded before the Justices-in-Eyre, as the King's Ser jeant (serviens) and several knights remembered it. It was at least ingenious. \u2014 She had stated that, on hearing a noise at night in the murdered woman's house, she went and peeped through a chink in the door (per medium hostii), that she saw four men within, who presently coming out, seized, and threatened to murder, her, if she gave any alarm, but (on her keeping silence) gave her those stolen goods (pelfam) which had been found upon her when arrested.

She was judged to deserve death, but the penalty was commuted for one hardly less terrible. \u2014 Sed per dispensacionem eruantur ei oculi, was the sentence.1 At these same Assizes a question was mooted as to what rights the King had in the bosc and pasture of Lilleshull. The Abbot ap peared with King John's own Charter of 1199 in his hands; which Charter conceded the site of the Abbey, and Lilleshull with its appurtenances, &c. in bosco et piano, in pratis et pascuis, fye. Judg ment was deferred.2 In 1220, Robert de Lilleston was a Juror on the Inquest men tioned under Dodicote.3 A Patent of May 7, 1250, allows that the Abbot and Convent of Lilleshull may hold, for a rent of 10s., twenty-three acres of land which they had assarted, without license, in their boses of Lilleshull and Haughmond, within the King's Forest. The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 says that the Abbot of Li lishull holds the Manor of LUishull by gift of King Henry IL, in perpetual almoign, and does suit neither to county nor Hundred.4 In April 1256, Sibil fitz Muriel has a Writ against Robert Abbot of Lilleshall for disseizin in Lilleshall. She has a similar Writ in August following. I suppose it was the third Walter de Dunstanvill (1241-1270) between whom and the Abbot of Lilleshall a question of boundary was in dispute. As \" Sir Walter de Dunstavyle Lord of YdeshaU \" he quitclaimed to the Abbot all right to common of pesson in the boses of Lylleshall beyond the road called Watlingestret, saving to both parties common of herbage on either side of Watlingestret. Moreover he allowed that the Abbot's men of Brerlatton (now Bur laughton) should have common of pasture in his (Walter's) wood of Lusgard (Lizard), paying one hen by way of rent for every three year-old beast so depastured. In return, Walter was to feed 60 swine, properly marked, and counted (talliatos) by the Abbot's Bailiff, in the forinsec bosc of Lilleshall. The Abbot also quitclaimed all right in the boses of YdeshaU, beyond Watlingstret, except the common pasture aforesaid.5 There is also a Charter whereby Gaiter de Dunstanvill son of Gaiter de Dunstanvul gives to the Abbey that bosc, beyond Wat- 1 * 2 Assizes, 5 John, m. 2 dorso, 4 dorso.

Witnesses, Richard Brace, Richard Urse, John de Haliton, Roger le Harper, and Alan de Garmeston.2 The Bradford Tenure-RoU (about 1285), says that \"the Abbot of LiUeshill holds the Manor of Lilleshill, with its members, viz. Donyngton and Mokeleston (Muxton) : also the three VUls of Attecham, Unkynton (Uckington), and Adbright-lee, of the King, in capite sine media, as members of the Church of St. Alchmund, Salop ; \u2014 by gift of the King, and by Charter. The Abbot has his free court and holds pleas of bloodshed and hue and cry, and has gaUows and Free warren.\" Robert o' the Hull of LiUeshuU occurs on a Sheriff-Hales Jury on April 28, 1294. It is curious that the LUleshall Chartulary should record the death of this Tenant in the same year. There is a memorandum how Robert de Monte died in his house at LyUes hull in 22 Edward I.- and how WUliam, his son and heir, being a minor, was in ward to the Abbot for five years. Then WiUiam, Clerk of Newport, having married Agnes, the said Ward's mother, bought his wardship and marriage, for 10s. Donnington Wood. On October 13, 1200, a Fine was levied at Westminster, between Geoffrey ChantereU, Plaintiff, and Walter Abbot of Lilleshill, Tenant (the Canon Benjamin being his Attor ney), of one virgate in Duninton, whereof was suit of mort d'ancestre. The Abbot now aUowed the Plaintiff's right to hold the premises in fee under the Abbot and his successors for a free rent of 4s. per annum. For this the Plaintiff paid 3\\ merks. At the Assizes of January 1256, Richard le Yongebonde and Alice his wife abandoned their suit de ingressu, against Richard le Bere and Geoffrey Chauntler concerning a half-virgate in Dunyton. Their Sureties were Griffin de Akilote and William Bordfaxe. It elsewhere appears that Geoffrey Chanteler had license to accord this suit for a fine of 6s. 8d. The Concord too. is preserved.

On October 6, 1203, Robert de Longedon, tenant of 6 acres in Duninton and Mukeleston, acknowledged by Fine that they were the Abbot of LUleshaU's. The Abbot conceded them to Robert, for life, at 4s. rent.4 The foUowing narrative in the Lilleshall Chartulary is intended to show the Abbot's right of wardship over any heir of Bere of Muxton. \u2014 \" William son of Richard le Bere of Mokeleston was in ward to Abbot Richard (1240-53) till his age was completed. And Ri chard, William's son, was in ward to Abbot William de Halys (1270-1275) till he was of full age : and he was restored to his land without being obliged to take a wife (sine maritagio) at instance of Master John de Cherlton, whose daughter, by name Bulga, he espoused.\" It is worth remarking that the name here written Bere was iden tical with Bear, and that the younger Richard le Bere was he who about 1273 has been seen attesting a Deed as Richard Urse.5 Also 1 Three others of the Associates are named on the Staffordshire Pipe-RoU of the same year (32 Hen.

For this the Abbot gave the Grantors par ticipation in all good offices and prayers of his house for ever.

The Bradford Hundred- Roll of 1255, with problematical accuracy, ascribes the Abbot's tenure of Longedon to a grant in pure alms of Henry II. Its free dom from suit of County or Hundred is also recorded on the same Roll.3 Public Records allude but seldom to Manors thus circumstanced. What we know of the history of Longdon consists chiefly of the Abbot of LilleshaU's negotiations with his neighbours. His en deavours to get the command of the River Tern, for the sake of a Mill, or Mills, prove the great value which was attached to that kind of property.

The Abbot had his negotiations with the Lords or Tenants of each of those vills. \u2014 At the Assizes of 1203, Reginald de Time withdrew by license a suit of disseizin which he had against the Abbot of Lilleshull, who, by erection of a stank in Langedon, had injured Reginald's tene ment in Time. About the year 1240, I find from a Rent-Roll of Lilleshull Abbey, that William de Tyrne (he was Grandson of the above Reginald) paid an annual acknowledgment of 6d. for using the Abbot's land (at Longdon) as a buttress for his Mill at Tern. At this time the Abbot's other receipts from Longdon were only 7s. 6d. rent half-yearly, and 8s. yearly from the Fishery there. William de Suggedon, at some unascertainable period, gave to Lilleshall that meadow on the bank of the Tyrne which formed an abutment for the stank of Longedon Mill. The meadow lay be tween the Lamilake and the said stank.1 William de Suggedon gave to LilleshaU the meadow called Mul nee, near to Longdon Mill, and surrounded on all sides by the water of Time.3 Richard son of William de Suggedon confirmed this gift of his Father.3 Nicholas Urse of Sugdon also gave the meadow called Mulnehec. Reginald fitz John of Sugdon gave that ford in Tern water which was called Straneford, and also that bank of the Tern which was next his meadow, called Frenesh, that the Canons might use it as an abutment for their Fishery.4 Hugh fitz Robert (1200-1249) gave to the Refectory of the Abbey an abutment in his land of Esnebrugg (Isombridge). It was on the bank of the Tern, in a place called Stromfort and opposite to that meadow in Longdon which was called Helfordisheye. The object was to secure a permanent Fishery for the Canons.5 In 1251 the Abbot of Buildwas (who had a small estate at Tern) took out two writs against the Abbot of Lilleshall. One was con cerning a stank in Tyrne, which had been unlawfully thrown down, the other was concerning a stank in Longedon which had been un lawfully erected. At the Assizes of 1256 Hamo le Strange sued the Abbot of LiUeshull for disseizing him of 2\\ perches of land in Wrockwardine. The Abbot alleged the land to be in Longdon, and submitted that, even if it were in Wrockwardine, Wrockwar dine was ancient demesne of the Crown. (He meant that a Writ of 1-2-s LiUeshaU Chartulary, fos. 68, 73. 4 * s Lilleshall Chartulary, fos. 73, 65."], [708, "236 LONGDON UPON TERN. novel disseizin could not lie in respect of such a property.) To this Hamo replied, that his Father, John, was Tenant-in-capite of Wrockwardine and had enfeoffed him. The Court decided that there was no disseizin, inasmuch as the present Abbot of Lilleshull had held the land continuously since his predecessor's death.1 There is a composition in the LilleshaU Chartulary showing how Sir Hamo le Strange had sued Abbot Robert of LiUeshull for dis seizing him of certain heath-land between Wrockwardine and Longdon, and how the Abbot had had a countersuit against Sir Hamo for disseizing him of a right of common, and how both matters were arranged.2 What claim Thomas de Withington (the husband, I presume, of Isabella Burnel)3 can have acquired to the Manor of Longdon it is hard to say. By a Fine, levied November 3, 1282, Thomas de Wytinton (Plaintiff) releases to Lucas, Abbot of Lilleshull (Tenant), the Manor of Longedon-super-Tirne, about which there had been a suit of Grand Assize. For this quitclaim the Abbot is said to give 400 merks ; \u2014 and the sum is not a fictitious one, for the Lilleshall Chartulary preserves a memorandum of 11 Edward I. (1282-3), in which the Abbot acknowledges a debt of 400 merks to Master Walter de Heselschawe, in respect of a quitclaim, made by the said Walter and Thomas de Whytinton, of the Manor of Longedon. As security for the debt the Abbot had given a power of distress on all his Manors in Shropshire to the Treasurer and Chamberlains of the King's Exchequer. However, on January 26, 1291, Master Walter de Heselschawe appeared in the Court of Exchequer at Westminster, and, before the Treasurer and Barons, acknowledged himself to have received the full payment of his debt.4 On January 5, 1283, the Abbot of LilleshuU obtained a Charter of Free- Warren in Longdon.6 In 1534-5 the Abbot of Lilleshall's receipts from Longdon, Cold-Hatton, and Tyrne, were returned as \u00a316 per annum \u25a0? but in the Ministers' Accounts, six years later, Longdon alone seems to produce an income of _\u20ac21. 9s. 8d., viz.

Such Chapelnes are seldom named in Diocesan or other Records.

At Duncot, a member of Uckington, the Abbot had a Mill, which seems to have been partly dependent for a supply of water on some Fishery, belonging to that Robert Dardif, whom I have named under Wroxeter and Norton.2 In the 12th century Robert Dardif and the Abbot had some disputes on this subject ; but, be- fore the year 1180, they came to the following agreement. \u2014 The watercourse (fossa) which the Abbot had cut (duxit) from Dardif's Fishery to his own Mill was to remain in the Abbot's possession. The Abbot's Miller was, as often as he pleased, but in open day, to dam up all other outlets of Dardif's Fishery, so as to train the water down to his Mill. And even by night he was to be at liberty to do the same, if so be that Dardif's Fisherman had not laid his baskets (fiscellas) for taking fish.

But if Dardif should carry out a proposed exchange of half his fishery with Roger fitz Henry (he was Lord of Withington), then the Abbot was to pay Dardif only 6d. yearly, and to return half the sum of 5s. now paid down.1 We have seen that this exchange did not take place, and that at a subsequent period Dardif gave the whole shilling rent which was coming from the Abbot of LilleshaU to the Abbey of Haugh mond.2 It would seem that Robert Dardif's estate in this neighbourhood passed to one Philip de Nugent, who, for a term at least, so acted as if the shilling rent, payable by Lilleshull to Haghmon under Robert Dardif's grant, was due rather to himself. Between the years 1174 and 1203, Philip de Nugent made an agreement with Walter, Abbot of Lilleshall. Philip gave his fishery of Ukynton in pure alms to the Abbey, so that the Abbey was to hold it at a ferm of 2s. 6d. payable to Philip for eight years, and then it was to remain (free of rent) to the Abbey. And as to the watercourse near the fishery (fossa juxta piscariam) the Abbey was to pay the shilling rent due thereon, to Philip for his life. Four years' ferm of the rent of 2s. 6d. is acknowledged to have been al ready received by Philip, and four years' ferm is stated to be yet coming to him.3 The term of eight years, stipulated for in this extraordinary document, is stated to commence ab anno decemnovalis cicli V\", dominicali litter d currente F -. \u2014 an inconsistent date,4 which leaves room only for a conjecture that the transaction took place about 1200. At the Assizes of 1203 Philip de Nugent essoigned his attendance at the common summons through Roger de Withenton. A century later, and we have seen that another Philip Nugent was stated to have a mesne interest in Withington ;5 but I find it impossible to indicate the exact tenure or tenures which Dardif and Nugent seem to have had in this neighbourhood.

We have seen the locality described as Austaneshill, and as \" a field of Uckington lying near Beslow.\"2 In 1252 the Abbot of LilleshaU has a Writ against John fitz Alan for disseizing him of a tenement in Okinton. This probably led to the perambulation between Wroxeter and Uckington, already noticed as having taken place in 1256.3 The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 attributes the Abbot of LilleshaU's tenure of Uckington to the grant of Henry II. The immunities of the Manor in respect of suits to County or Hundred are duly marked.4 On May 12, 1285, the Abbot of LUleshull obtained a Charter of Free Warren for his demesnes of Colde Atton, Okinton, and Hennecote.5 A LUleshall Rent-RoU, of uncertain date, gives the ferm of Ukyn ton, less the BaUiff's Salary, as 33s. 9\\d., due at Michaelmas, and 31s. 0\\d., due at Midlent.

Now it pays a rent of 6s. 8d.'n We have seen that the history of St. Alkmund's Manors as held by Lilleshall Abbey must needs be circumstantial. Atcham is no exception to the rule, unless it were worth while to enumerate the various Confirmations which secured both Manor and Advowson to the Canons. I prefer to iUustrate the subject with more interesting if less relevant detaUs. It was doubtless as a Parishioner of Atcham that Henry Mau veysin of Berwick became a Benefactor to LUleshall Abbey. His grants, already described,2 were afterwards increased by his son Herbert, whose brother William was probably a Canon of LilleshaU. The said Herbert, with William his brother, now one of the Reli gious (qui se Religioni reddidit), gives the arable land of Lochesheye to the Abbey. The said land is defined by \"- a road which goes up from a little meadow near the Severn and passes between Loches heye and Bruchesfurlong as far as a meadow ; and thence alongside the said meadow, all the arable land, tiU you come to the road from Ettingham to Berwick.\"3 I must here say something of \u2014 Helyas de Ettingham, a person of some note in his day, and a native of Atcham. He has been often mentioned incidentally in these pages, but especially as being attendant in the Court of King Richard in 1190.4 The fact is, that from Michaelmas 1184 till March 1199 he served Henry II. and Richard I. in the capacity of Custos of a House which those Kings maintained at Feckenham in Worcestershire. His salary for this duty was \u00a36. Is. 8d.per annum, and we find it paid more or less regularly on the Pipe-Rolls of Worcestershire, Staffordshire, or Shropshire. Sometimes the Custos makes a further charge for repairs, and > on one occasion (in 1185) King Henry makes him a present of 2 merks. For the half-year ending Easter 1193 Elyas de Etingehal (as he is called) was Fermoi of Feckenham. A Crown-debt of \u00a310. 10s. thus incurred, was paid by him in Shropshire, in several instalments between the years 1197 and 1201. In the meantime others had been Fermors of Feckenham. In 1195 we have seen him purchasing the ward ship and marriage of a Shropshire Coheiress, and bestowing her on his son Thomas.5 About the same time he attests two Charters of WilUam fitz Alan (II.) to Haughmond Abbey.6 He has also been 4 * 6 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 12 ; Vol. VI. pp. 175-6. 6 See Monasticon, VI. p. 108, No. II. 1 Domesday, so. 253, a, 1. 2 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 390. 3 Chartulary, so. 65."], [713, "ATCHAM. 241 named as a Feoffee in Muxton, a member of Lilleshall, about the year 1200.1 At the Assizes of October 1203, and again in April 1206, he appears as a Juror in causes tried by process of Grand Assize. This implies that he was a Knight. I will now show the concern he had in Atcham.\u2014 On October 6, 1203, a Fine was levied at Shrewsbury between Ralph Abbot of Lilleshall (Plaintiff) and Elyas de Ettingeham (Tenant) of half a virgate in Ettingeham, whereof was suit at law. Elyas acknowledged the right of the Abbot and of St. Alkmund. The Abbot allowed him to hold the said half-virgate together with another half-virgate, which he already held, at a rent of 3s. per annum. The tenure of both half-virgates was to be only for life of Elyas ; and both were to revert to the Abbot or his Successors.2 We have seen that Helyas de Ettingham's son, Thomas, was de ceased, without issue, in 1220. 3 We have also seen that there was a second Helyas de Ettingham, who having had a grant of Langley from Henry III., about the year 1249, was deceased in the year following.4 This. I take it, was that Elyas de Ekyngham for whom there was a Patent of Protection dated May 18, 1226, when he was about to accompany Richard Plantagenet, the King's brother, into Gascony. Of this family or its connection with Atcham I can say no more, unless indeed Thomas de Ettingham, named by John fitz Alan as his Attorney in a Lawsuit of 1251, was of the same stock. Another Fine was levied, I think in 1203, between Ralph Abbot of Lilleshall and Oliver de Ettingham, tenant, of a half-virgate in Ettingham. Oliver quitclaimed the same, but was allowed to hold it of the Abbot for life, paying one pound of frankincense, as a rent, on the day of the Nativity of St. Mary. On October 28, 1221, the Abbots of Shrewsbury and Lilleshull met at Echingham and adjusted several matters of dispute. They agreed to divide the Moors of Kinnersley and Donnington (Don nington Wood) ; and of Sleap and Longdon by arbitration of 12 selected men. \u2014 There had also been a breach made in the Severn bank at Ech ingham, under or below the bridge. This seems to have been on the Emstrey, or Shrewsbury, side of the River. Eight upright men, elected by both parties, were to settle this matter and provide for the due rights of the disputants in respect of the said breach.5 3-4 Supra, Vol. VI. pp. 142, 150. 6 Salop Chartulary, No. 282. \" Supra, p. 232. 2 LUleshall Chartulary, so. 81. 81 VIII."], [714, "242 ATCHAM. At the Assizes of November 1221, the Burgesses of Shrewsbury made a curious presentment, which gives us the earliest history of Atcham-Bridge. They said that the Abbot of Lilleshull had insti tuted a certain new custom at the bridge of Attingeham, in that he charged one penny on every loaded cart which passed over. The Abbot appeared before the Justices and stated that \" he had insti tuted no new custom, for that in fact, during the time of his Pre decessor, there was no bridge at all there, but the Abbot kept two boats on the River for the sake of ferrying men across, and the said boats brought him in 2 merks per annum. Afterwards by common council of Lord WiUiam fitz Alan and other great men (magna tum) it was provided that the said Abbot should construct a bridge and should take one penny for every cart of Salop, if laden, and one halfpenny from every other cart. And now this bridge was com pleted except one arch. In this way the Abbot came to levy the aforesaid custom.\" A Jury was called upon to decide the question. Their verdict was that the present Abbot and his Predecessor had now levied the aforesaid custom for 20 years, and had introduced no change (nullam emendacionem apposuerunt) . Coupling the above extract with what we know of the history of the House of Fitz Alan and the succession of LiheshaU Abbots, we conclude that the first bridge at Atcham was commenced by Abbot Ralph between the years 1200 and 1210, and finished by Abbot Alan about the year 1222. It consequently was in progress, or in suspense, during the whole period of the Barons' wars. Later in the 13th century, the Abbot of Shrewsbury concedes to the Abbot of Lilleshull that bank of the River Severn, towards Cronchull (Cronkhill) , which belonged to the former. The object of the LiUeshull Canons was to get a buttress (attachiamentum) for a certain fishery or weir which they proposed to form at Cronkhill Ford, or somewhere between that Ford and Atcham Bridge, as they might determine. The Canons were to pay a rent of 8s. for this concession, and to suffer distraint in case of non-payment. The Abbot of Shrewsbury agreed not to permit any other Weir to be constructed on the Severn between the proposed Weir, and the Weir of Haghmon Abbey. Witnesses, Sir Odo de Hodenet, Sir Thomas de Costentin.1 The Bradford Hundred-RoU of 1255 says that \" The Abbot of 1 Salop Chartulary, No. 398. The Haghmon Weir alluded to was that at Preston-Boats.

The Abbot appeared and pleaded that his own laud in Etinham and Saer's land in Berwick were of different Baronies, but that in time of Abbot Richard each party had shared in the common rights of the other, but that more recently this arrangement had proved un satisfactory, and that, since Abbot Richard's death, he, the present Abbot, had not aUowed Saer to participate in any common in Etin ham. The Jury decided that the present Abbot had wrought no disseizin, but, if there had been any disseizin, it was the late Ab bot's act. On October 16, 1269, King Henry III. granted license to the Abbot of LilleshaU to hold an annual Fair at Attingham on the day of St. Egidius (September 1) and two foUowing days.3 On June 25, 1276, King Edward I. gave a similar license for a Fair to be held at Attingham on the day of St. Augustine in May (May 26) and two foUowing days.3 In 1304 we have it recorded that Abbot William de Brugge as sessed a tallage on his Burgesses of Atyngham.

There is no case in which it is so clear as in this of Atcham, that the non-mention of a parochial Church, in Domesday, is no proof of the non-existence of such a Church. \u2014 On Easter Sunday (April 5) 1075, that is, ten years before Domesday was compiled, Ordericus the Historian was \" baptized at EttingesTiam, in the Church of St. Eatta the Confessor, which is seated on the bank of the River Severn.\" This fact we learn from the narrative of Ordericus himself, that simple, truthful, and ear nest Monk, to whose labours we owe so much ; \u2014 so much know ledge, not merely of the early annals of a county, but of a kingdom. It is not my purpose to make Atcham Church a text for any bio graphy of Ordericus. The touching story cannot be better told than in his own words ; and, if a commentary be wanting, we have it in forms with which we may be well content. The spirit of sub mission and self-sacrifice, the spirit of love and of prayer, when em bodied in the writings of a cloistered Monk, may fail to attract aught of homage from sectarian intolerance ; but the zeal and faith of Ordericus have been more than once recognized by minds which could contemplate the subject with a larger catholicity and a more Christian sympathy.2 We have seen that Atcham Church was dedicated to St. Eata the Confessor, whose day fell on October 26, while the Feast of St. Giles (September 1) was selected for the Epoch of an annual Fair. The theory therefore is non-universal, which supposes that there was any necessary association between the two things, \u2014 the Saint's day of a Parish Church, and the Saint's-day of a Parish Fair. As to St. Eata, something is known of his life, but little of his end. Being Abbot of Melrose in 651, he became Abbot of Lindis farne in 664, and in both positions distinguished himself as the early friend of, the afterwards great, St. Cuthbert. He was founder of Ripon Minster. In 677-8 he was consecrated Bishop of the 1 Valor Ecclesiasticus, III. 197, 198. 2 See Hist, of Shrewsbury, Vol. I. pp. 66-70 ; and Antiquities of Bridgnorth (by the Rev. G.

In 684?-5 St. Cuthbert, being appointed to the See of Hexham, exchanged with St. Eata. Some accounts say that Eata died in 685, others that he was driven from his See. It appears certain that Atcham Church was dedicated to him, and we have seen that the meaning of Etingham is the home of the children of Eata. Further than this I can hardly go. It is perhaps possible that an Abbot and Bishop of the seventh century, being bound by no law of celibacy, may have left descendants, and that those descendants, removing into Mercia, may have colonized Atcham and dedicated its Church to their canonized progenitor. I have related in a former Volume how, in the reign of Stephen, Atcham Church gained two-thirds of the tithes of Emstrey.1 Arch bishop Theobald's letter, enjoining the restoration of these tithes to Shrewsbury Abbey, speaks of the recent change in the patronage of the Church of Ettingham, viz. \"that it was among the endow ments of Lilleshull Abbey.\" It was Archbishop Thomas a Becket (1162-1170) who first al lowed the Canons of LUleshall to appropriate Atcham Church.2 His Successor, Richard, confirmed his Charter.3 The Taxation of 1291 values the Church of Ettingham (in Salop Deanery) at \u00a36. 13s. 4d. per annum? In 1341, this Taxation being duly quoted as one of 10 merks, the Assessors charged the Parish only \u00a35 for the Ninth of its wheat, wool, and lamb. The Church-Taxation, they said, in volved a carucate of laud which was the Abbot of LiUeshall's glebe as Rector. The said glebe and the small tithes could not be reck oned in estimating the Ninth, though, when a tenth was granted by the clergy on their gross receipts, these items were included in the Rector's assessment. Moreover, two virgates of land in the parish lay unfilled, from the tenants' want of means.5 The Valor of 1534-5 values the preferment of Thomas Apulby, Vicar of Attyngham, at \u00a311. 10s. per annum, less 3s. 4d. for syno dals and procurations.6 INCUMBENTS OP ATCHAM.

They preferred the life-lease to any other form of demise ; and it was thus that the value of their estates kept pace with the increasing value of land and the decreasing value of money. The trouble which, in the present instance, they took to change any real or supposed feoffment of the Bumels, into a lease, ultimately suc ceeded ; but it is clear that the Burnels long held to some tradition that they were entitled to be hereditary tenants of Albrightlee. On the death of William Burnel (II.), the above Grantee for life, that is about the year 1220, his son and heir William Burnel (III.) came in an evening to Abrightlee and took possession of the estate ; but was ejected that very night by Abbot Alan. William hereupon sued the Abbey for disseizin. The cause was heard at the Assizes of August 1226. The question was whether Alan, Abbot of LilleshuU (he was dead, be it observed), had unjustly disseized WUliam Burnell of his free tenement in Edbrigteleg. The Abbot (it must have been Abbot WiUiam) appeared and exhibited the Lichfield Fine made with the Plaintiff's Father.

The issue which went to the Jury was \" whether Alan, former Abbot of Lilleshull, had disseized William Burnel, Richard's father, of the Manor of Adbrihtleye ?\" The Jury found that a certain Abbot had given a life-grant to the present Plaintiff's grandfather, William ; that on William's death, another William, Richard's father, entered, and was ejected as aforesaid by Abbot Alan, and that this happened 10 years before the King's first transfretation into Brittany (i. e. ten years before April 1230). In this case Richard Burnel took nothing. However his claim does not seem to have been altogether worthless, for on November 3, 1273, a Fine was levied at Westminster, whereby Richard Burnel, Plaintiff, quitclaims the Manor of Adbritheleye to William, Abbot of Lilleshull, and receives 10 merks. So much for the interest of the Burnels in this Manor. I now return to notice a dispute between the Abbots of Haughmond and LilleshaU, which probably took place early in the 13th century. The erection of a Mill at Pimley, by the Canons of Haughmond, has been already noticed.1 It seems to have caused the stream called Pimbrook, to back-pound (redundare) upon Albrightlee. Hence the litigation, which was settled by the following agreement.3 \u2014 The Lilleshall Canons allowed that the said redundation should continue, but its degree was to be determined by a stone, called La Barra, which being placed near the watercourse was always to re main dry. The Fishery in Pymbroc and in Sumergeld was to belong to Haughmond, from Pimley Mill-stank up to the said Barra, on both sides the stream ; but from the Barra, upwards to Edbricteleg, and from the limit of the redundation in Sumergeld, the stream was to be common to both parties, as it had been of old. The Haughmond Canons, in return for all this, paid 12 merks down, undertook to make a bridge, and further transferred to Lilleshall an annual rent of one merk which was receivable from the Monks of Buildwas for Cuttesdon.3 The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 does not mention Albright- tains another document whereby WUliam Abbot of Hagmon (circa 1226-7) formally assigns the merk rent due from Buildwas, on Cuttesdon, to LiUeshaU Abbey. The consideration is \u2014 pro redundacione aqu\u00e6 vivarii nostri de Pimbeleg habendd supra terram suam (i.e. the Abbot of LilleshaU' s land) de Edbricteley. 1 Supra, Vol. VII. pp: 305, 308. 2 LUleshall Chartulary, so. 82. 3 Cuttesdon, near Sheriff Hales, an estate granted to Haughmond by Eitz Alan and Pantulf, but since leased by Haughmond to the Buildwas Monks, who bad an adjoining estate at Brockton.

It says that Albright-lee was held in capite by the Abbot of Lilleshull as a member of St. Alchmund's Church. An Abbey Rent-Roll, of uncertain date, gives the income from Edbricteleg as 12s. 4d. at Michaelmas, and 11s. \u00a7\\d. at Midlent, over and above the Bailiff's Salary. The Valor of 1535-6 probably includes the Abbot's receipts from Albrightlee in the \u00a326, said to arise from the Town of Salop. The Ministers' Accounts, five years later, do not include any item which can be taken to represent the dissolved Abbey's receipts from Albrightlee. The principal Undertenant whom I can name under this Manor is Richard de Edbricteleg, who was amerced 6s. 8d. at the Assizes of 1221, quia relraxit se. At a Forest Assize, held in 1231, the whole Vill of Edbrichteleg was amerced 20s. for default ; while Roger Mainard of Adbrithteleg, Robert de Aldebrithteleg, and Ro bert fitz Ralph de Edbrithteleg, appear as Uable to smaller fines.

That Record places the Manor or a part of it in Culvestan Hundred. It was unquestionably either in Bascherch or Recordine. I have alluded to the question twice before,2 and now prefer to treat Charlton as a Recordine Manor. I speak, for the present, only of St. Alkmund's share of the Manor ; \u2014 if indeed it was a divided Manor, as there is reason to think that it was. Domesday describes this share as follows. \u2014 \" The same Church (St. Alkmund's) held (in Saxon times) and still holds Ccrletone. Here is one hide.

The last Cherlton I take to have been near Preston Gubbalds, the first to have been near Shawbury. King John's confirmation also enume rates Cherlton among the same Prebendal estates. About the year 1177 (indeed that very year is given by an un vouched authority as the date of the transaction), the Abbot of Lilleshall and his Tenant at Charlton settled some misunderstand ing as to the terms of tenancy. \u2014 Richard de Chorleton acknow ledged to Abbot Walter that he had held the tenement called Chorleton by favour of Abbot William, and for Abbot William's life only, and that he had nothing of right therein. The Abbot and Convent in return allowed the said Richard to hold 3 virgates in Chorleton for Use, paying a rent of one petra of wax 3 yearly at Michaelmas. A fourth virgate was retained by the Abbot in demesne. Richard bound himself not to permit any of his people to mortgage or alienate the premises from the Church of Lilleshull. If he should wish to get rid of the tenancy, he was to commit it to none but the Abbot. If he should wish to change his state of life, he was to assume the habit of Religion in the Abbey, and at his decease he was to leave his body, with the aforesaid land, thereto. Richard de Chorleton swore to observe this agreement in the County-Court of Salop, where it was read aloud, and confirmed by the Sheriff's seal. Afterwards he swore to observe it before the Convent of Lilleshull.4 In Hilary Term 1243 the Abbot of Lilleshull was suing Ralph de Cherlton for half a virgate in Cherlton, alleging that the said Ralph had obtained ingress only through the demise of Ralph, a former Abbot, who had acted against the will of his Chapter. Ralph de Cherlton on the other hand maintained that he inherited the premises from his mother Edith, who had died seized thereof.5 In Easter Term 1243, Ralph de Cherlton not appearing at West minster, the half-virgate was seized in manu Regis? In Easter Term 1250 judgment in this cause was still unpro nounced. I find Ralph de Cherlton attesting an Orleton Deed in 4 Lilleshall Chartulary, fos. 61, 62, 81. s \u25a0 6 Placita, Hil.

On July 25, 1279, the same Henry de Erdinton gave to the Abbey of Lilleshull a certain meadow called Schauberieseye.1 Both these grants were recited and confirmed in Edward I.'s Confirma tion to Lilleshall in 1285. An early Rent-Roil of LilleshaU Abbey describes this estate as Cherleton juxta Stanton. This gives a further hint as to its situa tion, viz. that it lay in the direction of Stanton Hyneheath. At the date of this Roll, nothing in the way of income appears to have been receivable by the Abbey from this Cherleton. In the Taxation of 1291 the Abbot's receipts from Cherleton, in the Deanery of Salop, were \u2014 Assized Rents, 13s. 4d. ; income from a meadow, \u00a31.2 A Patent of March 10, 1336, allows Robert Corbet of Morton to give the Abbot of Lilleshull 3 acres of land in Morton Corbet, in exchange for 3 acres in Cherleton. The Valor (1534-5) gives the Abbot of Lylleshull an income of \u00a36 from Chorleton.3 The Ministers' Accounts, six years later, make Chorlton's Grange to be worth \u00a36. 13s. 4d. per annum? Parochially, Charlton was a member of Shawbury. This brought the Abbot of Haughmond (as Rector of Shawbury) into collision with the Abbot of Lilleshall. However the Lilleshall Chartulary preserves a composition whereby the Abbot of Haghmon releases to the Abbot of Lilleshull the small tithes of all live-stock (animalium) in the vill of Chorleton, and the tithes of all assarts, vivaries, mills, and meadows, which the Abbot of LiUeshull had in the said vill and within the Parish of Sahebyr'.5 1 Chartulary, so. 123. 4 Monasticon, VI. 265. 2 Pope Nich.

With respect to this Manor I must first quote the exact words of Domesday. \u2014 \" In Recordine Hundred. Rogerius tenet de Comite Cerlitone. Uluric tenuit. Ibi i hida. Ibi n servientes habent dimidiam carrucam ; et una carruca et dimidia adhuc possent esse. Wastum suit : modo reddit v solidos.\"1 It is not quite certain whether the person here described as Ro gerius, was Roger fitz Corbet, or Roger de Lacy. If the former, Cerlitone was his only Manor in Recordine Hundred. But at no subsequent period can any interest of Roger fitz Corbet, or Roger de Lacy, or their successors, be so traced in Recordine Hundred, as to establish the identity or situation of this Manor of Cerlitone. On the contrary, the doubt about the personal identity of the Domesday Rogerius does but increase a further doubt about the local identity of the Domesday Cerlitone. This last question of identity must however be discussed, if only to show its difficulties. I know but of three theories worth stating. \u2014 1. The first is, that Corbet's (or Lacy's) hide in Cerlitone was a part, that is a half, of Charlton near Shawbury, and that the other half (written in Domesday as Cerletone) was that Manor of St. Alkmund's, of which we were last treating. In support of this theory, we find that there was another Manor (Preston Montford) which Roger fitz Corbet (or Roger de Lacy). shared with St. Alkmund's Church, and that in that Manor all subsequent interest of Corbet, or Lacy, vanished, and no interest but that of St. Alkmund remained.2 Again, the Domesday rent of the hide called Cerletone was tanta mount to the rent of the hide called Cerlitone, viz. 5s. Lastly, Uluric, Saxon Lord of Cerlitone, had also a concern in Withington, Great Withiford, and Sleap ; \u2014 places with respect to which Charlton near Shawbury will be found central and more or less contiguous. 2. The second theory as to the identity of Cerlitone would make tion that the Rogerius of Domesday might have been Roger de Lacy. I will speak more fully on that point under Montford. 1 Domesday, so. 255, b. 2 Vide supra, Vol. VII. p. 194, where however I have not taken into considera-"], [728, "254 PEPLOW. it a part of the Domesday Manor of Cherrington, written Cerlintone in that Record. In support of this theory we find that the hidage of Cerlintone (3 hides), when added to that of Cerlitone (1 hide), realizes the exact measurement (4 hides), of which Cherrington consisted in 1255.1 3. A third theory is that Corbet's, or Lacy's, estate of Cerlitone was near to Preston-Gobalds, and eventuaUy became a possession of LUleshall Abbey, and a reputed member of Preston-Gobalds. When we see that Pope Alexander III.'s confirmation to LUles- hall speaks of Cherlton, and 9 acres in another Cherlton, as posses- sions of St. Alkmund's, we can hardly help concluding that two distinct places were alluded to. The same impression arises from the fact of Charlton near Shawbury having been called Charlton juxta Stanton, and so distinguished from St. Elstrud's Charlton, in the Lilleshall Rent-Roll already quoted. An undated Inquest, in the Lilleshall Chartulary, speaks as follows. \u2014 \" The Jurors say that the Abbot of Lilleshall holds Pres ton (Preston-Gobalds is meant), with its members, viz. Cherloton and Lee, of the Fee of the King, and it is geldable, and pertains to St. Alkmund's. Here is a hide of land, &c. &c. The said Abbot has in Cherloton 2 acres in demesne, and they are worth \u00a34 (Query 4s.) yearly. Also he has meadow-land there, worth 10s. Also he has heath and moor there, containing 4 acres, and worth 3s. per annum.\" Then follows a valuation of Lee. I will discuss this subject no further. The loss or cession of Cerlitone, whether by Lacy or Corbet, is consistent with its subsequent annexation to some other Manor, whether Charlton near Shawbury, or Cherring ton, or Preston-Gobalds. In any case we have some later account of the territory thus involved, under the Manor which may be supposed to have involved it. igeptoto* Ralph de Mortimer had three Manors in Recordine Hundred, all held under Earl Roger. They were Peplow, Preston on the Supra, p. 198."], [729, "255 PEPLOW. Wealdmoors, and Isombridge. Of Peplow Domesday speaks as follows. \u2014 \" Radulfus holds Papelau of Earl Roger.

In demesne there is i team ; and (there are) n Serfs and v Villains with m teams. In King Edward's time the Manor was worth 46s. (per annum) ; now it is worth 12s. 4d. He (Radulf) found it waste.\"1 That Ralph de Mortimer lost his three Recordine Manors soon after Domesday, and possibly by forfeiture for his rebellion in 1088, are subjects already alluded to in the analogous case of Cosford.2 It is Peplow that furnishes an all but reliable proof that, between the years 1091 and 1098, the Manors which were lost to Mortimer were held by Earl Hugh de Montgomery in demesne. The spuri ous Charter wherein that Earl is said to have granted to Shrews bury Abbey the tithes of his demesnes of Hodneth and of Peo pelaw,3 is confirmed by his less suspicious Charter,4* and by the Abbot's subsequent possession of those tithes. After the forfeiture of the Norman Earls, and probably by Henry I., Peplow was an nexed to the Fee of Hodnet ; that is, it became manorially, as it had been parochially, a member of Hodnet, and so was held in capite by the Lords of Hodnet, the hereditary Seneschals of Montgomery Castle. It is probable, I think, that Little Bolas was originally a member of Peplow, and was, with Peplow, annexed to Hodnet. Thus I un derstand the Feodary of 1284, when it enumerates Peppelowe and Bolewas among the members of Hodnet. So too on the death of William de Ludlow in 1316, Boulwas and Peppelowe are noted as members of his Manor of Hodnet. The succession of the Lords of Hodnet as already given under Westbury,5 and hereafter to be recapitulated under Hodnet, gives us therefore the fullest account of the Mesne-Lords of Peplow and Little Bolas. I have little more to say distinctively of Peplow, ex cept to notice that family of Swynnerton which held it under the Hodnets. \u2014 At the Assizes of 1203, Adam Forester essoigned the attendance of Robert de Swinnerton, who was included in the general summons. A fine of November 25, 1231, gives Ralph fitz Odo as Tenant of 3 3 * * Salop Chartulary, Nos. 5 and 3. 5 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 53 et seqq. 1 Domesday, so. 257, a, 1. 2 Supra, Vol. II. p. 263."], [730, "256 PEPLOW. virgates of land and a Mill in Peppelawe. I think that this Ralph was identical with Ralph or Randulf de Hodnet, mentioned on for mer pages as occurring about this period.1 By the Fine now under notice, he surrenders to Robert de Swinnerton, Plaintiff, the abov land and mill in Peppelawe. In return Swinnerton guarantees him an annuity of 40s. receivable half-yearly at Swinnerton (Stafford shire) , with power, in case of arrears, to distrain upon that Manor. He further pays him 10 merks down.2 By another Fine levied in Trinity Term 1281, Johnde Swynner ton (Impedient) recognizes the right of Richard son of Eudo de Hodenet (Plaintiff) to a Mill and 20s. rent in Peppelowe. In re turn Richard allows that John de Swinnerton and the heirs of his body shall hold the premises by payment of a penny rent to Richard and his heirs, and by performance of all capital services. In default of any heirs of John de Swinnerton's body, the premises were to revert to Richard and his heirs, \u2014 to hold of the Lords of the Fee. It would seem that this remainder took effect. At the Assizes of 1292, the Bradford Jurors presented Richard de Hodnet as hold ing half the vill of Peppelowe, value 40s. per annum. The legality of the tenure was in question, it seems, as an alienation of part of the Serjeantry of Hodnet. The cause was adjourned in consequence of Richard de Hodnet's Fine, already noticed under Westbury.3 The ultimate settlement of the matter transpires below. On April 24, 1374, it was found by Inquest to be no injury to the Crown, if Sir John de Ludlow, Knight, should enfeoff Thomas de Hodnet in 8 messuages and 3 carucates of land in Hodnet, Popelawe, and Heysord, so that Thomas should re-enfeoff Sir John and his heirs, receiving in exchange the Manor of Henley near Ludlow, to hold to Thomas, and his wife Johanna, and the bodily heirs of Thomas. The messuages and carucates aforesaid were members of Hodnet, and held in capite, and one Richard de Hodnet had sometime charged himself with a chief-rent of 15s. payable to the Crown for the same. Henley Manor4 was held of the Earl of March (as Lord of Ludlow, I presume) .5 Peplow Chapel.

Among the outlawed companions of Fulk fitz Warin who were pardoned by Patent of November 1203, I notice the following, viz. Baldwin. de Hodnet, Roger de Preston, John de Preston, and Richard de Preston. Of these it is certain that Roger de Preston was one of Baldwin de Hodnet's brothers. It is probable that he had a feoffment at Preston on the Wealdmoors, from which he took his name. It is certain that he held something in the neighbour ing vill of Horton under Baldwin de Hodnet j for Roger de Preston gave to LilleshaU Abbey half a virgate in Horton, held under him by Sierius Rotarius ; and this grant was afterwards confirmed by Odo son of Baldwin de Hodnet, who calls Roger de Preston his Uncle.2 But before this, and in the time of Henry II. and of Richard I., there was one Pagan de Preston. Him, with his brothers Eustace and Roger, we have seen attesting two grants to Wombridge Priory.3 Now this Pagan was not, I think, a Hodnet ; but only Hodnet's Tenant in the whole or the greater part of Preston. All that I about 1188 (supra, Vol. II. p. 279, note 51).

Moreover they re nounce all the right which they had in the Park called Le Haye Gubald. For this the LUleshall Canons gave them 3\\ merks in their urgent necessity. The above Deed is entitled in the Chartulary as Carta sororum de Preston de stagno vivarii de Lubsty ibi firmando et exaltando ,- \u2014 a description which shows that it was the Abbot's wish to secure the command of the smaU stream which runs between Preston and Lubstree Park. The date of the above grant may be partly determined by the confirmation of Baldwin de Hodnet (1204-1224), who \"concedes the concession which the heirs of Pagan de Preston, his Vassals (homines) had made, in respect of the stank of the Canons' Vivary of Lubesty, and in respect of their Park there.\"2 Subsequently to this, Agnes, daughter to Pagan de Preston, au thorized two renewals of her former grant. In one case she ap pears as a widow ; in the other, as wife of a second husband, Roger de Preston ;3 \u2014 possibly that very Roger whom we have seen to be Baldwin de Hodnet's brother. So too Sabina de Preston renewed her former grant, as the widow of William de Horton.*4 I find it impossible to trace the succession of each Coheiress of Preston ; neither am I sure whether some of the persons now to 1 These locaUties are probably to be identified at the present dav.

I have probably named some of the descend ants of William and Sabina de Horton under Horton itself. Thomas Rabace, or Rabaz, occurs as a Surety, a Witness or a Juror in 1231, 1235, 1248, 1249, 1253, 1255, and 1258. In 1256, at the Assizes, one Henry Capel challenged Robert son of Thomas Rabaz for a violent assault, and Thomas the father for instigating it; but both charges were withdrawn. In 1258, Thomas Rabaz was party to a Fine of one virgate in Preston which has already been set forth.1 The appearance is as if his heir, or at least the heir of his wife, was caUed Robert de la Forde. Sibil de Preston, though a widow in or before 1224, was living in 1255. At that time she and Thomas Rabaz held two out of several shares in a hide of land at Pontesbury,2 but I cannot make out that the other shareholders were descendants of Pagan de Preston. William de Preston, the first husband of Agnes de Preston, may have been identical with WilUam fitz Walter of Preston, who in 1209 was twice assessed for imbladements within regard of the Wrekin Forest. Adam de Preston occurs as a Witness or Juror in 1249, 1256, 1258, 1260, 1262, 1264, 1279, 1280, and 1284. In 1256 he was impleaded by John de Preston and Agnes his wife, for disseizing them of a tenement in Preston; \u2014 but they withdrew the suit, and were with their Sureties (WUliam de Erie ton and Adam Pride of Salop) in misericordid. In 1262, he (Adam de Preston) was a Verderer of the Shropshire Forests, and in 1284 one of the Regarders of the same. Possibly there were two Adams in succession. In 1262, the viU of Preston in Wyldmore was amerced 3 shiUings by the Forest- Justices for neglecting to attend an Inquest, and Alan de Preston, resident in Wellington, was amerced Is. for vert. John de Preston, above mentioned as a litigant in 1256, occurs on a local Jury in 1264. Ralf de Preston occurs similarly, about 1258, and in 1264.

The Feodary of 1284 merely names Preston as a member of Hodnet, but says nothing of its tenure. This omission is sup plied by the Assize-RoU of 1292, when Pagan de Preston, William de Preston, Richard de Forde, and William de Horton, were quest ioned as to their tenure of this alleged member of the Serjeantry of Hodnet. They appeared, and stated that their ancestors had held Preston under the Lords of Hodnet from the time when Roger de Beleme, Earl of Salop, enfeoffed William de Hodnet's ancestors in the Serjeantry of Hodnet. A Jury was got to corroborate this statement, which, though it contained a falsehood as to name, and probably as to date, was doubtless correct in assigning a very high antiquity to the tenure of Preston. Payn de Preston occurs as a Witness or Juror in 1296, 1302, 1308, and 1320. In one instance he is called Master Payn de Preston. Philip de Preston occurs on a Jury in 1304. So does \u2014 William de Preston, and he probably was a Coparcener in the Manor. In the years 1336 and 1340 the four Coparceners of Preston were Thomas de Styvynton, Hugh de Heth, Richard de Horton, and Richard son of WUUam de Preston. An idea of their further descent may be gathered from the subjoined list of presentations to Preston Church. THE CHURCH. This Church is not named in the Taxation of 1291, nor was the Parish assessed as distinct in 1341. I am of opinion that the dis trict originally belonged to the Saxon Parish of Wellington,1 and that the Church, whenever founded, was founded by the Lords of the Manor.

A Knight here has half a hide of the said land. The value of the Manor was and is 20s. (per annum) .'n Isombridge, like Peplow and Preston, seems to have been lost to Mortimer immediately after Domesday, and to have been annexed to the Earl Palatine's demesnes. Either Earl Roger or Earl Hugh conferred the Manor on the Chief Forester of Shropshire. No such person as a Chief Forester is named in the Shropshire Domesday, but the office must have been created immediately afterwards, for Ulger Venator, the first known Forester, attests a genuine Charter of Earl Hugh (between 1094-8) ; and there are reasons for think ing that Ulger was not the first Forester or the first Lord of Isom bridge after Mortimer's cession thereof. Cotemporarily, as I think, with the creation of this office of Forestership, Isom-bridge ceased to be the Caput of a Manor. Great Bolas, previously a member of Isombridge, was made the Caput. Hence the hereditary Foresters of Shropshire are often called Foresters of Bolas. I shall here treat of Isombridge as a mere member of Bolas, re serving much that I have to say of the successive Foresters till I speak of the capital Manor. The third known Forester was Robert fitz WUliam, Ulger's Grandson. A RoU, about the year 1200, says specifically that \" Robert fitz William, the King's Forester, holds in Anebrig one Mill which pays 10s. (per annum), and one caru cate of land which is worth 10s. Qd. (per annum).\"- Hugh fitz Robert, the fourth Forester of Bolas, made a smaU grant in Isombridge to Lilleshall. This has been noticed under Longden.

For this Philip gave 20 merks. About the year 1325, two parcels of meadow-land in Isenbrigg, worth 2s. per annum, were in the King's hand, because, being part of a Serjeantry, they had been purchased, without Royal license, by Henry Wyldegous and WiUiam at Nasse.3 ISOMBRIDGE CHAPEL.

He was associated with the treason of Earl Robert de Belesme in 1102, and was one of those who were entrusted by the Earl with the defence of Brug Castle.2 His timely surrender of that fortress procured for him not only the pardon but the favour of King Henry I. I conclude that the Forestership of Shropshire was founded by the Norman Earls, and greatly augmented by Henry I. Bolas, I think, was part of the endowment given to the Forestership by one of the Earls ; for we are authentically told that Ulger's Predecessors had it. Now if Ulger himself had succeeded before the death of Earl Hugh, in 1098, his Predecessor or Predecessors must have held office and estate between 1085 (the date of Domesday) and 1098. Consequently they must have been enfeoffed either by Earl Roger or Earl Hugh. Ulger Venator has been seen attesting a Charter of the Viceroy, Belmeis, about 1115.3 A Precept of Henry I., earlier probably than this, is addressed to \" Ulger, and to Geoffrey de Bortone, and to all the King's Foresters of Salopescire.\"4 Again, Henry I.'s great Charter to Shrewsbury Abbey, passing in May 1121, has the personal attestation of Ulger Venator. Ego Ulgerius Venator sub scripsi, are the words appended to the Deed.5 Ulger Venator apparently survived the accession of Stephen (1135), for I find record of a Charter of that Usurper, by which Ulger's descendants held the Manor of Bolas and its members. This Charter is apparently quoted verbatim, when the same Record states that \" King Stephen restored (reddidit) the Manor of Bowlas to one Urger Venator, to be held by him as freely as his Predecessors held it.\"6 William fitz Ulger, son and heir of Ulger Venator, appears first on the Pipe-RoU of 2 Henry II. (1156). He there accounts for a Crown-debt of 10 merks, the half of which he had paid into the King's treasury, while the other half had been excused in the name of\u00b0Nicholas de Castello, so that William fitz Ulger was quit. Again, on the Pipe-Roll of 1161 William fitz Ulger is entered as owing' the King one merk ; but I find no liquidation of the debt. Before 1172 William fitz Ulger gave the Fishery of Esnebrugg 4 \u2022 5 Salop Chartulary, Nos. 49, 35. 6 Bradford Tenure-RoU (penes mei). 1 Supra, Vol. 1. p. 355, note 438. 2 \u2022 ; Supra, Vol. VI. p, 287 ; Vol. III. p. 234. 34 VIII."], [740, "266 BOLAS MAGNA. to Haughmond Abbey, as we learn from the Bull of Pope Alex ander III. confirming the gift. In 1176 William fitz Ulger had been amerced 5 merks by Henry II. for some breach of Forest -Law. The entry is on the Pipe-Roll for Herefordshire, where it will be seen that the Shropshire Foresters had a valuable estate, \u2014 part of the endowment of their Serjeantry. In the next year (1177) the following entry occurs on the Shropshire Pipe- Roll. \u2014 Willielmus filius Ulgerii debet 100 so lidos pro habendd recognicione de maritagio matris su\u00e6, unde dis saisita suit tempore werr\u00e6, sinejudicio. So then Ulger Venator's widow was living as late as the Civil War of 1173-4, and being suspected of disloyalty was deprived of some estate which was her marriage-portion. William fitz Ulger's Fine of 1177 is repeated without liquidation on every Roll till the year 1182. Then it is certified that he was dead. Nevertheless the Fine is stiU repeated till the year 1186 in clusive. Robert fitz William, son and heir of WiUiam fitz Ulger, has been noticed under Cotes, Dorrington, and Cantlop.1 When, in the year 1200, Hugh de Nevill held Pleas of the Forest in Shropshire, Robert fitz William fined and paid 3s. 5d., pro trenched deVilinton, probably for leave to make some clearance in the King's Forest near Wellington. About this date the Serjeantries of Shropshire were assessable to some aid or tallage, probably that which was sometimes called carnage? \" Robert fitz William, the King's Forester in Salopsire,\" seems to have made a return of all the estates held by him in Serjeantry, and to have proffered a sum of 3 merks as a composition for the whole. The particulars of Cotes, Dorrington, and Isom bridge, have been given elsewhere. Caynton, Calvington, and Orleton, usually reputed to be members of Bolas, are separately described, though they were covered by the Fine. Bolas itself con tained half a carucate of land held in demesne, and worth 6s. 8d. (per annum) ; one carucate and a half, held in villanage, and realizing 18s. ; and a Mill, paying 10s 3 All that I have further to say of Robert fitz William is, that he gave a rent of 4s. in Boule was to the Abbot and Convent of Lilleshall. Robert fitz William died in 1203, owing an amercement of \u00a3100 to the Crown, which 1 Supra, Vol. IV. 38 ; Vol. VI. 21, 287. nus Rex taUiaret totam ten-am per carr u cas.\" It was distinct from Hidage. 2 A Glossary in the LiUeshaU Chartu lary says of Carnage \u2014 \" Hoc est si Domi- 3 Testa de Nevill, p. 61."], [741, "BOLAS MAGNA. 267 sum, as well as 20 merks for the Relief of his son and heir, is charged to the name of \u2014 Hugh fitz Robert, in the same year. In or about the year 1205, a taUage by the carucate was levied in Herefordshire, on aU Serjeantries. The Assessors returned Hugh fitz Robert as holding Bromsted, per forestariam? A Roll of the year 1211 is more ex pUcit in stating that \" Hugh fitz Robert held Bru'feld, by forest serjeantry in Shropshire, and by gift of Henry I.,\"3\u2014 to Ulger Venator, I presume. In a RoU of Shropshire Serjeantries returned in June 1211 it is said that \"Hugh fitz Robert used to hold (tenuit) of the King, by service of being Chief- Forester of the County of Salop, but that his land was in the King's hand by precept of the Forest- Justices last in eyre.\"s The said Eyre was probably that of Hugh de NevUl and his FeUows in 1210. A Royal mandate of August 23, 1213, is addressed to Robert fitz WUliam as Forester of Shropshire.* The substitution of the de ceased father for the living son is evident. A Writ of January 28, 1214, is more correctly addressed to Hugh fitz Robert.5 Of Fines recorded as having been made shortly previous to Michaelmas 1214, one of 100 merks is by Hugh fitz Robert, Forester. It was for having the bailiwick of the Forests of Shropshire as his father had had it. He had already paid 20 merks, he had been excused 30 merks by Writ- Royal, because, at request of the King, he had taken to wife the niece of John le Strange. He still owed 50 merks.6 Another Record supplies us with a curious hint about this name less niece of John le Strange. On September 1, 1214, the King, then at Partenay, in Poitou, sends her to Peter de Maulay, and tells him to bestow her person, her horse, and its accoutrements, with his (De Maulay's) mother.7 The damsel had apparently been waiting on the Queen (qu\u00e6 suit cum domind Regina). Why King John's cares should have further extended to providing her with a husband is hardly latent. Probably the Shropshire Forester's wife was a natural daughter or a discarded mistress of that licentious Monarch. A Writ of February 16, 1215, shows Hugh fitz Robert in full exercise of his functions as Forester;8 but he subsequently re nounced his fealty to King John, and forfeited his estates. On September 11, 1217, a Writ of young King Henry certifies that he i \u2022 2 \u2022 3 Testa de Nevill, pp. 73, 70, 55. 6 Rot. Pipe, 16 John, Salop. * * 5 Claus. I. 148\u2014 b, 162\u2014 b.

The King's Writ of Diem clausit on the death of Hugh fitz Robert bears date February 5, 1249.3 A Here fordshire Inquest, held on the 22nd instant, reported the value of his estate at Bromfeud, and found that John, son and heir of the deceased, was 25 years of age. The Shropshire Inquest said that the deceased had held all his land of the King (which was untrue as regarded Sugden and Cantlop), by service of keeping the King's Forests in Shropshire, and that he and his Ancestors were Chief Foresters. Bolas, with its Mill, Fishery, rents, and one carucate of demesne-land, was calculated to be worth \u00a38. 3s. 8\\d. per annum. Erletun (now Orleton)*4 realized \u00a33. 13s. 10\\d. Mestun (now Meeson) realized \u00a34. 6s. 3\\d. ; and Kaginton (now Caynton) brought 18s. 8d. of assized rents. On March 11, 1249, the King received the homage of \u2014 John fitz Hugh, as heir of his Father, his Relief being fixed at 15 merks.5 The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 records how John fitz Hugh was holding the Manor of Bowlewas by serjeantry, viz. as Capital Forester of all the Forest of Salop.6 In July 1269, John fitz Hugh was named as a Justice to deliver the Gaols of Shrews bury and Stafford. At the Assizes of 1272, he appears as a Knight and a Juror in causes of Grand Assize. His Serjeantry was made matter of presentment, and his estates at Bolas, Isombridge, and Brumfeld, stated to constitute a knight's-fee. On July 18, 1284, the King's Writ announces the death of John fitz Hugh and orders the Escheator to seize his lands. On July 30, 1284, an Inquest, held at Lylleshull, valued his estates at Bolas and Bromfeld at \u00a312. 5s. 8d.per annum. Hugh, his son and heir, was found to be of full age.7 1 * 2 Claus.

On August 5, 1284, the King accepted the fealty of\u2014 Hugh fitz John, sixth lineal Forester of Shropshire. \u2014 The Feodary of that same year, usually known as Kirby' s Quest, says merely that \" Hugh fitz John holds the Manor of Bolewas, with its members, of the King in capite .-\" but the Tenure-Roll which belongs to nearly the same period is much fuller but less ac curate. It enumerates Meiston (Meeson), Esumbridge (Isombridge), Caynton, Calvynton, Ellerton (Orleton), and half the vill of Sogdon (Sugden)1 as members of Bowlas. It says that Hugh fitz John held the whole by Charter of King Stephen, and that he held his free court at Bowlas twice yearly, and adjudged cases of bloodshed and hue-and-cry, and had a gaUows. On March 5, 1292, King Edward's Writ of Diem clausit an nounced the death of Hugh fitz John. The Inquest, which followed on May 1, says that the deceased had held the viU of Esnebrugge, with his other lands, of the King by Serjeantry.2 The items given under Esnebrugge are, \u2014 a Capital messuage; \u2014 a carucate of de mesne-land worth 30s. per annum ; \u2014 6 acres of meadow worth 9s. ; \u2014 rents of 30s. Id., a pound of pepper, a pound of cummin, and a pair of iron spurs ; \u2014 and 5s. for pleas and perquisites of Court. Bolas itself does not appear to have been in the hands of the de ceased, but he was in receipt of 42s. per annum \" from the Lady of Boulewas;\" \u2014 a matter which I wdl explain presently. Roger fitz John, brother and heir of the deceased, is stated on the Shropshire Inquest to be 26 years of age and upwards. The Herefordshire Inquest tells how the deceased had held Brumfeld by Grand Serjeantry, viz. as Chief Forester of Shropshire, but states the heir to be 30 years old and more. Sara Lady of Bolas, above alluded to, seems to me to have been widow of John fitz Hugh, and to have had Bolas in dower, except that it was charged with an annuity of \u00a32. 2s. to Hugh fitz John, her son, or stepson. On John fitz Hugh's death (1284) Dame Sara became the second wife of the third Brian de Brompton, who had lost his first wife in that very year. Sir Brian dying about three years later (i. e. in 1287) left Dame Sara a second time a widow.3 Hence at the Assizes of October 1292, the Jurors of Bradford Hundred made a presentment that \" Sara, Lady of Bol was, held seven librates of land in Bolwas, and had been married to Brian de Brompton, now deceased.\" -The Lady appeared to the 2 Inquisitions, 20 Edw.

She confessed that she had married Sir Brian without license ; and compounded for this feudal irregularity by a Fine of 5 merks, naming Roger de Bitterley and Roger de Holycote as her Sureties. To return to \u2014 Roger fitz John ; the Bradford Jurors presented him at these same Assizes for exercising Free-Warren in Boidewas. They also detaUed the various alienations which had been made of this Ser jeantry since the time when \" Euger le Venor (Ulger Venator) had held the Manor of Boulewas as Custos of all the Forests.\" Be sides other alienations, which I reserve to their proper place, one of Esnebrugg to John de Ludlow must be noticed here. John de Ludlow appeared and explained that he only held that Member of Bolas for a term of 10 years, and by demise of Hugh fitz John, de ceased. Nor was the transaction illegal, for Hugh fitz John, when about to depart for the Holy Land, had obtained the King's leave to demise all his lands for the said term, and in such sort as that, in case of his death, no absolute loss of territory could result to the crown (nil depereat in terris Domino Regi) . John de Ludlow was dismissed sine die. In Hilary Term, 1293, Roger fitz John of Bowelewas had to an swer in Staffordshire for holding Pleas of the Crown, and having warren, gallows, and ways, at Bowelewas. He denied that he exer cised any right but the first, which he justified by immemorial usage of his Ancestors. Hugh de Louther's counterstatement, that Richard I., as Lord of Bradford Hundred, had had the Crown-pleas of Bolas, was ignored by verdict of a Jury.1 On the great perambulation of the Shropshire Forests, taken in 1300. Roger fitz John is the first-named of the Foresters then in office. On May 21, 1301, King Edward ordered it to be ascertained by Inquest whether it would injure the Crown to allow Roger fitz John to give the Manors of Boulwas, Brymfeld, and Isenbrigg, and the Serjeantry of the Shropshire Forests, to John le Strange, to be held by the latter and his heirs immediately of the Crown, and by the accustomed services. The Jurors replied in favour of the trans fer, stating that Roger fitz John's only remaining tenure would be that at Rodington already described.2 I do not think that this transfer was ever made, except perhaps in trust. King Edward's Writ of* Diem clausit on the death of Roger fitz John, bears date April 25, 1302.

Esnebrugg is treated as a member of Boulewas, worth \u00a32. 14s. 2\\d., from rents of Richard de Clotley, Gregory de Dodinton, and other tenants. The Herefordshire Inquest, recording the deceased Forester's tenure of Bromfeld, states that John his son and heir was 3 years of age on June 10, 1302. The Shropshire Inquest makes April 19, 1299, to have been the heir's birthday.1 John fitz Roger, the infant in question, had a long minority, and occurs as a ward of the Crown in 1318. Meantime, that is in the Nomina Villarum of 1316, Isabel le Strange is set down as Lady of Bolas.2 Of her I will say no more than that she also appears as Lady of the Norfolk Manor of Litcham. In May 1322 however, John fitz Roger presented to Bolas Church, as \" Lord of Boulewas,\" and in 1324, as \" Lord of Brymfeld,\" he was summoned by the Sheriff of Herefordshire to attend a great Council at Westminster.3 An Inquest, taken at Newport, January 8, 1349, found Boulwas to be worth 100s. per annum. It was the sole Shropshire estate of John de Boulwas. He now proposed to convey it to Trustees, who were to settle it on himself and his wife Petrondla and his heirs.* Sir John de Bolas was living in 1360. My coUections as to this family do not enable me to treat con secutively of its further succession. Some hints on the subject will be found among the presentations to Isombridge Chapel, already detailed, and to Bolas Church, as given below. For other particu lars I refer elsewhere.5 BOLAS CHURCH. I take Edgmond to have been the Mother Church of this district, but think that Bolas, having been founded by the Lords of the Fee, soon attained independence.

On July 21, 1321, this Rector has license to put his Church at farm for a year, and pursue his studies. John fitz Herbert of Bascherch, Chaplain, had been presented to this Church on May 17, 1322, by letters of John fitz Roger, Lord of Boulewas, but Edmund, the existing Rector, appealed against his institution, which was delayed.

This member of Bolas was held under the Lords of Bolas, by a family which took its name from the place. William de Caginton was amerced 20s. in 1180, for not pro ducing one for whom he was Surety. About the same time we have seen him attesting a Deed of his Suzerain, Robert fitz William.2 In the assessment of Robert fitz William, already quoted, and sup posed to have been made about 1200, WUliam de Sagint's tenure under the said Robert is said to be, \u2014 half a carucate of demesne, worth 6s. 8d. ; one carucate held in villanage, worth 16s. ; and a Mill, worth 10s. per annum. Robert de Kamyton, as his name is written, attests a Deed about 1223,3 and was Juror on a LUleshall Inquest, about 1242,4 where his name is written Kakinton? He was soon afterwards suc ceeded by his son and heir \u2014 William de Kaginton (IL), who occurs on a local Jury in February 1249, and again in 1274 and 1275. His success in re covering an estate at Pixley in 1283, has been already noticed.6 I find him attending three local Inquests in that same year, and one in the year following. The Bradford Tenure-RoU (about 1285) gives him as holding Caynton, a member of Bolas. In 1292, how- married Petromlla de Rodington (supra, Vol. VII. p. 380), was identical with the above Robert.

The latter was a Minor and in custody of Sara Lady of Bolas. William de Kaynton appeared in Court to account for his title to hold any part of Bolas. He stated that he was Tenant-in- Socage of Roger fitz John, to whom he paid 6s. 8d. rent, and that thus his ancestors has held from time immemorial, and that what they so held was no part of the Serjeantry. This the Crown Prosecutor denied, and stated that Kaynton, being part of a Serjeantry, had been alienated no further back than the reign of Henry III. The matter went to a Jury, which found that \" before King Henry I. held anything in Shropshire (i. e. before the Escheat of the Norman Earls) the ancestors of William de Kaynton were seized of Kaynton, paying half a merk rent to the Lords of Bolas, and further that the vill was no part of the Serjeantry.\" Wilham de Kaynton was hereupon dismissed sine die. William de Kaynton's tenure by half a merk rent is duly speci fied in the Inquisition on Roger fitz John's death in 1302; and in March 1304, WiUiam de Kaynton occurs on two local Juries. CALVINGTON. This member of Bolas was held by Feoffees of the Foresters of Bolas from an early period.\u2014 A Fine of September 25, 1199, shows William Porcel and Matilda his wife, quitclaiming for 30s. to Robert fitz William a half virgate and bovate in Kelviton, which they had claimed under plea of mort d'ancestre. Henry de Lega, about the year 1200, is stated to hold half a carucate in Calventon, worth 6s. 8d. per annum, under Robert fitz WUliam.1 This Henry was, I think, a Cadet of the Lees of Hughley. In 1209, Robert son of Henry de Leg' was amerced half a merk for a recent pourpresture on the King's Forest ; but I doubt whether this Robert was son of the Lord of Calvington, for, at the same time, Henry de Lega apud Kalvinton (as he is called) was assessed 18d. for an imbladement of 3 acres of oats in Mount- Gilbert Forest. Whether Henry de Lega, mentioned in a former page as occur ring in 1221,2 was of Calvington, I cannot say. There was also a Henry de Leg5 who sat third Juror on a WeUington Inquest in May 1264. 1 Testa de Nevill, p. 61. 2 Supra, Vol. VI. p. 307."], [749, "CALVINGTON. 275 About the latter period, Calvington, or a great part thereof, seems to have got into the hands of Hugh de Lee of Hughley.

The Bradford Jurors, at the Assizes of 1292, presented Edmund de Legh as holding Calvyngton, a member of the Bolas Serjeantry. The said Edmund appeared in Court and acknowledged that he held Calvyngton without render of any service to the King. The estate was ordered to be confiscated, but Edmund fined one merk to retain it tUl next ParUament. His Surety was John de Esthope. Calvynton would seem afterwards to have been held with Orleton by the Orletons, and immediately of the Crown; that is, if we may rely upon a statement which I shall notice under Orleton.3 Meeson. This member of Bolas seems to have been held by a family taking name from the place. WiUiam de Meston has oc curred to us about 1245 as a Feoffee in Tibberton.4 On January 27, 1249, William, son of William de Meston (Plaintiff), quitclaims to Geoffrey Griffin (Deforciant) all right of common which he had claimed in Geoffrey's meadow called Le Gorstes* in Crugelton.

Further mention of this second William de Meston has been made under Tibberton.1 He or his father was perhaps identical with William le Fraunceis (who, together with William de Eton, was amerced half a merk in 1247 for some default in Suretiship), and with WiUiam Fraunceys of Meston (who occurs ou a local Jury in 1249). In the time of Edward II. we have Thomas de Meston attesting an Ercall Deed. ORLETON. I should perhaps more properly treat of Orleton as originally a member of the Royal Manor of Wellington : but whereas it was annexed to Bolas, at least as early as the reign of Henry I., I pro ceed to speak of it here, in its most known relation, viz. as an out lying member of Bolas. Radulf de Erleton, the first of his name who occurs, was probably Tenant here of the Lords of Bolas. He was living between 1141 and 1155, as we have seen under Cherrington. After him comes \u2014 Adam de Horleton, already noticed as attesting two Charters between 1174 and 1180,2one Charter about 1175,3 and a fourth Charter, of Robert fitz William (his Lord), about 1180.4 Pope Alexander III.'s Confirmation to Haughmond Abbey, passing in 1172, records how Adam de Werlethune had given half a virgate in Greneleshul (Grinsill) and all the tithes of the same viU to that Abbey. We know that Adam de Horleton was succeeded by \u2014 Ralph de Orliton (II. ), his sou and heir; \u2014 for the latter con firmed his father's grant to Haughmond. We have seen Ralph de Horliton, or Horleton, attesting two Wombridge Charters, one about 1186-7,5 the other about 1195.6 The interest which he acquired at Beckbury in 1196 has also been noticed.7 About the year 1200 we have it recorded that Ralph de Horlet' held of Robert fitz WUliam's Serjeantry, half a carucate of land and a Mill, worth one merk yearly, the current assessment on which tenure was covered by the Fine or composition of Robert fitz William.8 In his attestation of a Leighton Deed (circa 1210 1215) Radulf de Erleton is followed by his brother William.9 Ralph de Orleton occurs once more, and at a period perhaps ten years later. It is as enfeoffing a Tenant in all his land at Grinsill, \u2014 a matter of which I shall speak elsewhere. 1 Supra, p. 50. - Supra, p. 47, and Vol. VII. p. 355. 3 \u25a0 4 Vol. VII. p. 321 ; Vol. VI. p. 287. 5 \u2022 6 * <\u25a0 Supra, Vol. II. pp. 112, 133, 68. 8 Testa de Nevill, p. 61. a Supra, Vol. VII. p. 328."], [751, "277 ORLETON. After this there were a William and a Thomas de Orleton, co temporary. Both sat on a Withiford Jury in 1248, and Thomas is named first. However I beUeve Thomas to have been head of a younger branch of the family, and attribute his precedence to his acquired, or professional, importance, rather than to any right of birth. William I conceive to have been son and heir of Ralph, and Lord of Orleton. The earliest notice which I have of \u2014 William de Erleton, is his Fine with Richard de Leighton in 1240.1 Besides the Withiford Jury of 1248 I find him on a Lee gomery Jury of 1258 and a Sheriff-Hales Jury of 1260. In 1264 he was one of the Jurors who were sworn to ascertain the value of Bradford Hundred. After this, the same or another \u2014 William de Erleton occurs, viz. on two Juries in 1284. Him the Bradford Tenure-Roll (about 1285) describes as William de Ellerton, and as holding Ellerton, a member of Bolas under Hugh fitz John. At the Assizes of 1292 he was a Juror in several cases of Quo Waranto, and was himself questioned for holding Erleton, a member of a Serjeantry, without license. He fined half a merk to retain the estate tiU next Parliament, Richard de Hodnet being his Surety. He occurs on two Jury-lists in 1293. On November 21, 1295, the King's Writ of Diem clausit announces his decease. It seems that he no longer held Erleton under the Lords of Bolas, but as a Tenant in capite, at a rent of 6s. 8d . This estate was valued at \u00a32. 14s. 4d. per annum. He had also a tenement at Clotleye held by a rent of 12d. payable to the \" Church of St. Andrew \" (Wroxeter, I presume) . It only yielded Is. 6d. to the owner.2 Adam de Erleton, son and heir of William, is stated on the In quest to have been 22 years of age at Easter 1295. I find it asserted3 that in 27 Edw. I. (1298-9) he paid the King 16s. 8d. for his relief for Erleton and Calvynton, members of Bowlewas, but I cannot verify this from the Fine-Roll. Adam de Erleton was de ceased March 14, 1305. Erleton with its MU1 was now valued at \u00a32. 9s. per annum, and was held in capite at 6s. 8d. rent. At Clotleye, 2 cottages and 9\u00a3 acres of land, held at 12c.. rent * under the Church of Wroxeter, were valued at 8s. per annum? in 1347 the rent receivable by Wroxeter Church from Clotley was 2s. ; \u2014 that is, I suppose, there was another rent besides De Erleton's. 1 Supra, Vol. VII. pp. 329, 330. 2 Inquisitions, 24 Edw.

John de Erleton, son and heir of Adam, was only 4 years of age on May 31, 1305. Of him, pending his long minority, I can say nothing. But an Inquest, taken at Newport on April 12, 1324, found that it would be no injury to the King to allow John, son of Adam de Erleton, to enfeoff John de Hynkeleye and Elizabeth his wife in one messuage, one Mill, two carucates of land, ten acres of meadow, and 26s. rent, in Erleton and Clotleye, to be held by the said John, Elizabeth, and the heirs of John, in capite. The premises were held by a rent of 6s. 8d., payable at the Exchequer, and were worth \u00a34 per annum. No land would remain elsewhere to the Grantor. A second Inquest, taken at Newport on November 12, 1324, found that it would not injure the King if he allowed the above John and Elizabeth (who had acquired the premises without license, and had suffered forfeiture thereof) to repossess them, and to hold them in capite by accustomed services. \u2014 An indorsement on this Inquest suggests that the application failed. It notes how John de Erleton appeared personally in Chancery at Nottingham on December 16, and proved on examina tion to be deaf and dumb. \" So,\" says the indorsement, \"nothing of this Inquisition stands without good and deliberate Council.\"1 \u2014 I suppose that the question which suggested itself to the Officers of Chancery was reaUy, whether the Crown was not entitled to the perpetual wardship of John de Erleton, as of one whose state was almost tantamount to idiotcy. I now return to speak of \u2014 Thomas de Erleton, who, attesting several Wombridge Deeds between 1225 and 1245, is in one instance styled Sir Thomas,Clerk of Erleton, in another is accompanied by Ivo de Erleton, and in another by Adam Clerk of Erleton. In 1241 he was one of four Visors of repairs at Shrewsbury Castle. He occurs also on an Uppington Jury of 1243, a Withyford Jury of 1249, and a Bolas Jury of February 1249. Thomas de Erleton has already been noticed as purchasing half a virgate in Uppington of Alice de Burton.2 Ralph de Erleton, son and, I think, heir of Thomas, occurs as early as March 1248, that is in his father's lifetime. \"William de Garmunstun demised and conceded to Ralph, son of Thomas de Erletun, that house, croft, and seilion, in the VU1 of Erletun, which Godith, a widow, held ; also half an acre in Bradelcg, and one acre 1 Inquis. 17 Edw.

Witnesses, Robert de Clotleg, Thomas de Welintun, Radulf de Cherletun, John de Cherletun.\"1 Ralph de Erleton occurs on a Leegomery Jury of 1251, about which time I take him to have succeeded to his father. On March 26, 1257, Simon de Wauton is commissioned to try a cause between Hamo le Gros and others, of the one part, and Thomas Mauveysin and Radulf de Erleton, of the other part, viz. whether certain land in Chateleye pertained to the Church of Wroxeter, or was the lay-fee of Thomas and Radulf.2 On two Jury-lists of 1258 and 1260 Radulf precedes William de Erleton. Radulf was certainly a Tenant in Orleton ; for, in Octo ber 1259, Roger de Napton and his wife implead him, under writ of mort d'ancestre, for a messuage and land in Erleton. About this time Ralph de Erleton attests a Wombridge Deed already quoted. It would seem, from what has transpired above, that WiUiam de Erleton eventually succeeded to Radulf s interest in Clotley. The only other member of this family, whom I shall name here, is Pagan de Erleton, who occurs as a witness in 1305. ' As to Minor Tenures in Orleton, Ralph Gold is incidentally named as a Tenant in the Lease of 1248. Singularly enough, at the Assizes of 1256, Ralph Goky and Petronilla his wife, tenants of a messuage and 8 acres in Erleton, were impleaded for the same by Jubana, as daughter and heir of Reginald de Erleton.

However the isolation or half-isola tion of places called Eyton is not invariable, but their propinquity to water is. So I take ea to be the direct and real root of such names, and not eah, which is only metaphorically and accidentally descriptive of their situation. The important Manor of Eyton-upon- Severn is noticed in Domesday as one of those held by Shrewsbury Abbey as the gift of Earl Roger.1 \u2014 \" In the City of Sciropesberie Earl Roger is making an Abbey ; and he hath given to the same the Monastery of St. Peter, where was a Parish of the City, and as much of his Burgesses and Mills as brings in \u00a312 (yearly) to the Monks.2 The same Church holds Aitone. Earl Leuric held it in the time of King Edward. Here are eight and a half hides. In demesne are mi ox-teams, and still two teams more might be (employed). Here are xvi ViUains, and xim Boors, with xvi teams. Here are viii male, and mi female, Serfs, and ii Fisheries. One (of the Fisheries) pays 16s. (yearly) ; the other goes towards victualling the Monks. In King Edward's time the Manor was worth \u00a321 (per annum) ; and when the Earl gave it to the Church it was paying \u00a314.\" Any allusion of Domesday to a state of things existent in the days of Leofric, Earl of Mercia, is, as far as Shropshire is con cerned, exceptional. The Shropshire Domesday, in short, usually refers to the status of Manors as held by Leofric's widow, Godiva, or his grandsons, Edwin and Morcar. This general rule has been already pointed out.3 The Domesday notice of Eyton is abnormal. Earl Roger's grant of Eyton to Shrewsbury Abbey is certified by his own general Charter, as well as by the Confirmations of William Rufus,4* Henry I., Stephen, Henry IL, and Henry III. Richard Peche, Bishop of Coventry, confirming to the Abbey the tithes of its various demesnes, includes \" the whole tithes of Astone and Eyton,\"5 both of which places were, as we know, in the Parish of Wroxeter. The Forest Assize-Roll of 1209 charges the Abbot of Shrewsbury for two imbladements in Euton or Eton, within regard of the Forest of Mount Gilbert. For 30 acres sown with oats he was charged 15s., and 6s. for 6 acres, otherwise cultivated. 1 Domesday, so. 252, b, 1. 3 Supra, Vol. III. p. 63, note 3. 4 Vide supra, Vol. VI. p. 171. 5 Salop Chartulary, No. 329. 2 For some remarks on this passage, see Hist, of Shrewsbury, Vol. II. pp. 2, 8."], [755, "EYTON ABBOTS. 281 The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 says that \" the Abbot of Salop holds Eiton of the gift of Earl Roger de Beleme, in free alms, and it is a Manor of ix hides, and does no Suit to County or Hun dred.\" Here I need not point out the misnomer by which Earl Roger is described. To account for the increase on the Domesday hidage I am unable, unless indeed Aston, once a member of Wel lington, was now computed with Eyton. The same Hundred-Roll notices, under Eiton, certain persons whom I take to have been the Abbot's Tenants, but who were liable to certain dues to the Crown. \u2014 Walter le Longe held an acre of assart in the Forest of Mount Gilbert, paying 9d . rent to the King's Exchequer ; Ayote, wife of Wyot, held another acre at the same rent; and Richard Blawne-Coste held 1\\ acres and one perch at a rent of 15d? Henry III.'s Charter of Free-Warren, dated May 21, 1256, gives the Monks of Shrewsbury that privilege in their demesne- lands at Eyton. The Bradford Tenure-Roll (about 1285) enumerates the then members of Eyton Abbots. They were, Aston (near the Wrekin), Siwaldeton (a place now lost), Riston (now Rushton), Donynton, and Drayton. The Abbot held the whole of the King, in capite sine medio. He had at Eyton his free court, wherein he held pleas of bloodshed and hue and cry. He had gallows and free-warren, and exercised those privileges by Charter of the said Earl (read King) and by Royal confirmation.

It does not appear that even the Abbot of Shrewsbury's demesnes at Eyton were exempt from payment of tithes to the Mother Church. We infer that, so far, Bishop Peche's confirma tion to Shrewsbury Abbey, as quoted above, was ultra vires and inoperative. The only notice which I have of Eyton Chapel shows it distinctly as an affiliation of Wroxeter Church, and proves that the Vicar of Wroxeter was in 1347 bound to serve it, \" as it had been served from ancient time.\"3 Drayton, now Dryton. The Monks of Shrewsbury had a Te nant here, viz. William, son of Edward de Drayton. About the year 1230 this WiUiam and his Mother, Aveline, acknowledge in the Court of Sir H.

The Abbot now allowed them to hold the premises for their lives, for 20s. paid down, and at a rent of 18d. Witnesses, William, Priest of Wroxeter ; Thomas de Eiton, Thomas his son.* William, son of Edward de Drayton and Cecilia his wife, have been noticed as Feoffees of Alice Mussun at Uppington about 1225-6. The Deed of feoffment is attested by William Chaplain of Drayton, that is, by William de Drayton, Chaplain, who, as I 1 Valor Ecclesiasticus, III. 189. \u2022 Monasticon, III. 529. 3 Supra, Vol. VII. p. 315. 4 Salop Chartulary, No. 124, b."], [757, "283 EYTON ABBOTS. have elsewhere stated,1 was the same person with William, Priest of Wroxeter. About 40 years later than this, viz. about the years 1260-70, we have three several Uppington Deeds attested by WiUiam Pilrin of Dreiton, and William the Parson his brother. It is hardly prob able that these two were identical with William fitz Edward and William the Chaplain, above mentioned. Be this as it may, Wil liam the Chaplain appears before the year 1240 accompanied by his son Alan ; and we have seen that William and Petronilla, son and daughter of one Alan de Drayton, succeeded to estates at Chatwall and Berrington, the former before 1255.2 Chronology wiU not allow us to suppose that the said WiUiam and Petronilla were grandchildren of William the Chaplain; but that all these persons were members of one family I cannot doubt. Again, \u2014 the wide interval at which WUliam, the Chaplain or Canon, occurs (viz. from 1225 to 1276) suggests a doubt whether a single person is thus described. Again, William de Dreyton, Seneschall, attests a Charter of the first John fitz Alan as early as 1218, and WUliam de Dreyton, son of William, occurs in 1262,3 and is perhaps the individual who, as William de Drayton, Bailiff of Wroxeter, is addressed by the second John fitz Alan in a letter dated September 21, 1265. We have intermediate notices of one William de Drayton as a Feoffee in Uppington and a witness of Uppington Deeds. In 1262 such a person occurs too, as one of the Regarders of the Shropshire Forests. In September 1272 William de Dreyton-Pelerin and Richard de Dreyton were Recognizors in the great trial noticed under Al brightlee. Robert de Drayton, Juror on a Leegomery Inquest in 1258, may have been of this place. I think he was son of another Robert. In 1276 William son of Walter de Drayton, with assent of his wife Emma and his heirs, surrenders to his Lord, the Abbot of Salop, certain meadow-land, tUl five crops should have been taken there from. Witnesses, Master Robert de Stoke, John de Prestcote, Adam le Bole, Gilbert the Beadle.4 Donnington. Robert Bras occurs on an Uppington Jury in 1243. Richard Bras of Doniton was Juror on a Wellington In quest in 1278. He is probably the person noticed in a former 3 Supra, Vol. VI. p. 294. i Supra, Vol. VII. p. 316. 2 Supra, Vol. VI. p. 37. 4 Salop Chartulary, No. 124, c."], [758, "284 EYTON ABBOTS.

I can only guess the situation of this lost member of Eyton. In a Grant to Wombridge Priory,2 a certain acre in the fields of Uppington is described as lying near the footpath called Quenesty, which footpath seems to have run between Aston and Siwaldeston. Siwaldeston probably lay between Aston and Rush ton. At the Assizes of 1221 Luna fitz Richard failed to appear in a suit of novel disseizin concerning a tenement in Siwaldesden, which she had instituted against WiUiam fitz Gregory, a Chaplain. The Defendant was dismissed sine die. A Deed was among the Newport Evidences whereby \"Alan son of Richard de Siwaldisdon gave to Richard son of William de Dray ton\" a house and some land (probably in Siwaldston or Upping ton) . A foss which extended towards the barn of Dame Petronilla ; \u2014the road which led to Rustone ; \u2014 a place called Stanechestre ; \u2014 and the road at Hupiton, are mentioned among the boundaries of the grant. The Deed was attested by Thomas de Constantine, Richard de Leighton, Robert de Cherleton, Walter de Drayton, Robert Bras, and Adam fitz Brice. I suppose this Deed to have passed about 1230-40, but am very doubtful as to its date. In Michaelmas Term 1282, Walter de Dreyton was suing the Abbot of Shrewsbury for disseizing him of common-pasture in Si waldcsdon. Wilham and Robert de Siwalsdon occur on a local Jury in 1298. Of Rushton, another member of Eyton, I have no particulars to add to those already given. O Aston and its early history I shall speak under Wellington, for originally it was a member of Wellington. It came to be re puted a member of Eyton because it was given to Shrewsbury Abbey. Supra, Vol. VII. p. 394. 2 Chartulary, Tit. Upinton, No. 24."], [759, "285 J_fauejj)ton. I have already treated of that part of Haughton, which, being a member of Upton Magna, has no distinct mention in Domesday? The other part was a Manor in itself, and was held by Roger Vena tor. It is described in the Record as follows. \u2014 \"Roger Venator holds Haustone (of the Earl). Edwi held it (in Saxon times). Here is one hide, geldable. The (arable) land is (enough) for n ox-teams. Here is one Tenant (homo) rendering a ferm of 6s.\"2 The Seigneury of this Half-Manor continued, as we should ex pect, with Roger Venator' s descendants, the Barons of Pulverbatch. The Tenants thereof were those Constantines whose history I have sketched under Oldbury and Eaton Constantine. The feudal, and perhaps blood; relationship which subsisted between the Barons of Pulverbatch and the Constantines has also been illustrated under Pulverbatch.3 The foUowing Deeds wiU show how the Constantines dealt with their tenancy at Haughton. \u2014 1. About the year 1200, as I think, Thomas de Costentin en feoffs Stephen de Stanton4, and his heirs, for their homage and ser vice, in aU his part of Meresbrok, at a rent of 12d. The Grantee may make a Vivary and mill, but must give an equivalent to the Grantor's tenants in Halghton for such land as the Vivary shall oc cupy. The Grantee may raise his stank so high as that the water of his Vivary shall ascend over three perches of land, (measuring) from the rivulet which faUs into Meresbrok. Witnesses, Robert de Wode cote, Hugh de Wodeforde, Reyner de Acton; Helias and Ralph, the Grantor's brothers, and Robert de Espelee.5 2. Stephen de Staunton gave to Thomas de Costentin and his men of Halghton a right of common in his (Stephen's) land of Roden, in return for the donation, which he had had from the said Thomas, of the site of Meresbrok Mill.

About the year 1220 Thomas de Constantin grants all his land in Halghton to Robert son of Stephen de Stanton, for his service and for 14 merks paid down, and at a rent of 2d. Witnesses, Wil liam de Hetlee, Vivian de Roshall, Baldwin de Smethcote, Baldwin Wischart, Philip de Peninton, Robert fitz Aer. 4. It must be assumed that the rent of 12d. receivable from Meresbrok Mill merged with the last Deed, as becoming due to Robert de Stanton himself. He however seems to have renewed the charge in favour of a third party. About the year 1220 Ro bert de Stauntune gives to Haughmond Abbey, with his body, all the land (4 virgates) which he had bought from Thomas de Con stantine, in the vill of Halghton, together with a rent of 12d. due from Halghton Mill. A rent of 2d. only is reserved to Thomas de Constantine. Witnesses, Duiet Cellarer of Haghmon, Henry Cook, Roger Palmer, Roger his son, Richard Hirdman. I imagine that Robert de Stanton died within the walls of Haughmond Abbey. At his death, then, the Canons became seized of the Manor of Haughton, holding it by payment of 2d. yearly to Thomas de Constantine, who held of the Lord of Pulverbatch. 5. Soon afterwards, Thomas de Constantine's mesne-right van ishes, for he confirms Robert de Stanton's Deed, and releases the rent of 2d. due to himself. Witnesses, Robert de Gyras, Vivian de Rosshale. 6. By another and equivalent Deed, Thomas de Costentin gives and confirms a moiety of Halghton to Haughmon Abbey, with as sent of his son Thomas. 7. About the year 1230 William de Staunton acknowledges that he and his heirs are bound to pay the Canons of Haghmon 12d. rent for the \" impounding of water by Roden Mill,\" which rent Robert, his brother, had bequeathed to the Canons with his body. Witnesses, Hugh English (Anglicus), Hamo Marescote, William Banastre, Wido de Hadenhale, and Thomas Cresset. The Bradford Hundred-Roll of 1255 puts down the whole vill of Halihton as 1^ hides, paying 6d. for motfee and 6d . for stretward. The Abbot of Haymon is stated to be Lord of the Half-Manor (now under consideration), and to hold it of the fee of Pulrebach? The Feodaries of 1284-5 agree that the Abbot of Hawemon held half Haughton of the Fee of PhUip Marmion of Pulverbatch. The Taxation of 1291 gives the Abbot of Haughmond nothing but 3s. assized rents in Halton subtus Haghmon? Some subse- 1 Rot. Hundred. II. 56. 2 Pope Nich.

They were in all \u00a32. 8s. 8d? Of Undertenants in Haughton the first to be noticed are the Cressets. About the year 1210, as I guess, Thomas de Costentin grants to Thomas Crasset, for a rent of one pound of cummin, a half and a third of a virgate in Halghton. Witnesses, Stephen de Staunton, Robert and William his sons; WiUiam de Hedleg; Robert fitz Aer ; Hugh de Hupton ; Philip de Peninton ; Helias de Costentin ; William, Ralph, and Richard his Brothers. From his attestations of Deeds I conclude Thomas Crasset to have been living in the year 1235 and somewhat later. His suc cessor seems to have been William Crasset, who attests two Char ters between 1240 and 1250, and who, or one of his name, was living in June 1290. The latter, when under indictment for homi cide and other crimes, was appointed Beadle or Lessee of Bradford Hundred by its Bailiff, Walter de Pedwardine. In 1292 the Bai liwick was seized by the Crown in consequence of this flagitious appointment; but Pedwardine re-obtained it by replevin. About 1270-80 I find mention of another Thomas Cresset of Haughton,3 and in August 1331 I find Thomas Cresset attesting a Deed of the then Earl of Arundel. This I presume to be the same Thomas Cresset to whom, with Edith his wife, Isolda, daughter of William Willy of Halghton, gave two seilions in Halghton, one of which was bounded by land, late Richard de Leighton's.4 By a subsequent Deed, Edith Cresset, widow, gave these two seilions to PhUip her son; and on January 17, 1339, Philip Cresset quitclaimed them to Nicholas, Abbot of Haghmon. Witnesses, Thomas Cresset of Wi thiforde, Thomas Cresset of Halghton (probably Philip's elder bro ther), and Walter Cresset of Uffington.

Also on July 28, 1339, the same Abbot leases two parcels of waste in Halghton to Margery and Alice, daughters of Thomas Cresset of Halghton. On July 26, 1349, Richard son of Thomas Cresset of Halghton gives to Haghmon Abbey 5s. rent out of tenements in Halghton. Witnesses, WUliam de Smethcote ; Ni cholas de Harley, Clerk; PhiUp, Lord of Penynton; WiUiam de Muriden ; and Walter Cresset of Uffington. Other Undertenants in Haughton occur as foUows. \u2014 About 1253, Thomas de Haleton attests a grant to Haughmond Abbey. About 1245, Hugh son of Robert de Staunton gave to Haghmon Abbey, for 2\\ merks, a rent of 3s. 6d. which he received from WUliam de Almania for one virgate and two-thirds of a noke in Halghton. Witnesses, Sir William de Ercalewe, Stephen de Penynton, John de Rodene, Reiner de Withiforde, WUliam Crasset of Halghton, Roger fitz Gilbert (of Haughton), and Henry de Uffinton. Also Roger fitz Gilbert of Halghton gave to the Abbey, two acres in the field of Halghton, which Gilbert his father had bequeathed, with his body, to sustain the lights before the High Altar in the Church of Haghmon. Witnesses, Henry de Sibbeton, Alan Brito, Ralph de Preston, John de Horton, Thomas de Halghton, William his son, and William de Almagne. About 1260, the last witness, as William Alemon of Halghton, gives, for the same purpose, 2 acres in Halghton, one of which is said to be in the field of Veninton. Witnesses, Sir John fitz Aer, John Lord of Arcalwe, Philip de Peninton, WiUiam Crasset of Halghton, and Roger fitz Gilbert of Halghton. Also William, son of Richard, son of Adam de Asteleg, with Avota his wife, gave for the same purpose, one acre in the fields of Halghton, which he bought from William Alemon, part of which is described as in the field towards Ruleye. Witnesses, Sir John de Ercalwe, Sir John fitz Aer, knights, Philip de Peninton, and Richard de Sogedon, Clerk. The two last Deeds name Roger Gery as an adjoining Landholder, and the last Deed simUarly names WilUam fitz WUUam.
