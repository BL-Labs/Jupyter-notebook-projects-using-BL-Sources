As it is of importance in this navigation, which requires great care, for the mariner to be acquainted with the general sy.-tem of the winds in the Channel, a brief notice of them is prefixed, with the caution that the wind has considerable effect upon the strength and set of the tide streams, as well as upon the range of the tides. A notice of the signals established for indicating the depth of water at the entrance of the French ports, and of the system adopted for the colours of buoys and beacons, is also prefixed. -winds. \u2014 The prevailing winds in the Channel are those from the western quarter, which generally blow during two-thirds of the year. Gales from the westward are felt in all seasons, but it is from November to March inclusive that they are most frequent, and generally last three or four days. Of these, a gale from the S.W. is considered to be the most dangerous in the eastern part of the Channel, for when it is accompanied by rain it blows in violent gusts, and sometimes suddenly changes its direction to N.W., North, and even to N.E., without losing its strength, [E. C 2.] B"], [18, "2 [chat. I. COAST OF FRANCE. and causing, in a few hours, a heavy sea upon the French coast to the southward of Cape Gris-Nez. If the wind remains fixed in either of the latter points, and its force moderates, the weather becomes fine ; but should it back round to the S.W. the bad weather is sure to return. It has been generally remarked that those gales which occur during the springs are more violent and last longer than those whicli take place during the neaps, and that it is at the beginning of the flood stream that they acquire their greatest strength. Gales from North to N.E. are also violent, but they usually last only from 24 to 36 hours, and the wind does not shift as it does with those from the westward. They cause a heavy sea on the flood stream, and during their continuance the French coast is covered with a white fog, which has the appearance of smoke. This is also the case with all easterly winds, which are sometimes of long duration, and blow with great force. S.E. winds, accompanied by rain, are often violent, and almost always turn into gales, during which the wind in the squalls flies quickly round to N.E., and sometimes to North and N.W., making it dangerous to be upon the French coast when these unexpected changes take place. If it remains fixed in either of the latter points, and moderates in force, the weather is soon re-established, but should it return to the S.E. or South, the bad weather will continue. Moderate winds from N.W. to N.E. are those which bring fine weather. In the summer the N.E. wind blows more particularly in the afternoon. In the morning there is a light breeze from the S.E., but towards noon it changes to N.E. and freshens ; towards the evening it decreases, and at night it is calm, and the cool air condenses the vapours. When this condensation does not take place, it is a sign of a change of wind. Dead calms are of rare occurrence, and do not last long, except in summer. When they occur during winter, it is regarded as the precursor of bad weather. The most certain indications of bad weather are, swell in the offing during a calm, and surf on the coast. In wet winters snow is abundant, and when it blows, the wind con tinually changes its direction, and the snow, which whirls and obscures the air, prevents the land from being seen. During the intervals of these snow showers, there is often great difficulty in making out the parts of the coast which may be in sight, as the snow completely changes their appearance, and renders them difficult to be recognised. The greatest quantity of hail falls during the months of March and April. These hail showers have the inconvenience of causing sudden changes iu the direction of the wind, and are consequently dangerous to vessels navigating near the shore."], [19, "3 CHAP. I.] WINDS. FOGS. TIDAL SIGNALS. fogs are frequent in all parts ofthe Channel. They form, both on the English and on French coasts, in the valleys and on the low marshy lands, from whence the winds drive them out to sea. In summer, the heat and the slightest breeze is sufficient to dissipate them, and it is only in the morning that they hide the land ; but the moist haze, driven in by westerly winds from the sea, is more tenacious, and only yields to strong winds. This haze always causes a short sea, and it frequently turns to rain and brings bad weather. In the north-eastern part of the Channel, it is rare for the land to be completely free from vapours, unless previous to strong N.E. winds, when it may be distinctly seen from a great distance. The winds from the western quarter, as has been remarked, bring thick clouds, which fre quently hide the land ; and when they blow strongly from the eastward, the vapours which cover the land are dense in proportion as the wind is strong and lasting. Mirage is frequent during the season of fine weather on the French coast, from the river Somme to Cape Alprech. It is considered as an indication of fine weather, when it only tends to enlarge the apparent size of objects ; but at all seasons when it distorts them, so as to render them difficult to be recognised, it is considered as a sign of rain or of strong easterly winds. tidal signals. \u2014 The following new system of tidal signals was issued in August 1855 by the French minister of commerce and public works, and is now used at most ofthe ports on the coast of France. The signals are made by balls and flags hoisted on a mast, on which a yard is crossed. The balls are black. A bail hoisted at the intersection of the mast and yard will denote a depth of 10 feet English in the channel between the jetties. Each ball hoisted on the mast beneath the first will denote an additional depth of 3i ft. Each ball hoisted above the first will denote an additional depth of 61 ft. Each ball hoisted at the left yard-arm (looking from seaward) will denote an additional 10 inches. Each ball hoisted at tlie right yard-arm will denote an additional ] ft. 8 in. To indicate the state of the tide a wliite flag with a black cross is used ; also a black pendant. These are hoisted at the mast bead immediately there are 6^ ft. in the channel, and lowered when the water has receded to the same level. During the flood the pendant will be above the flag ; at high water and b2"], [20, "4 CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO CAPE BARFLEUR. [chat. i. during the top os the tide the pendant will be lowered ; and during the ebb the pendant will be below the flag. When the state of the sea is such as to prevent vessels from entering* the port, the above signals will be replaced by a red flag hoisted at the mast head. BUOYS and beacons.\u2014 A uniform system of colouring all buoys and beacons is observed on the French coast. In entering a port, buoys and beacons painted red must be left to starboard, and those painted black to port. The beacons below the level of high water, and all warping buoys, are painted white. The small rocky heads in the fre quented channels are painted in the same manner as the beacons, when they have a conspicuous surface. Every buoy or beacon bears in full length, or abbreviated characters, the name of the shoal or rock which it is meant to distinguish, and also its number, showing its numerical order in the same channel. These numbers commence from seaward ; the even numbers on the red buoys and the odd numbers on the black buoys. The letters and numbers are painted white on the most conspicuous parts of the buoys, and from ten to twelve inches in length. The masts of the beacons which do not present sufficient surface are surmounted for tliis purpose by a small board. All the jetty heads and turrets are painted above the half tide level, and on the former a scale of metres is marked commencing from the same level. cape de la HAGUE, the north-western extreme of Normandy, is low and sand}', but the coast at the distance of 3 miles to the S.S.W. suddenly rises, about 320 feet above the level of the sea, into a high bluff promontory called Nez-de-Jobourg, which may be seen in clear weather from the distance of 24 miles. On the top of the promontory is a small hummock, the slopes of which extend to the almost perpendicular cliffs on its western side.* The most conspicuous objects in the vicinity of Cape de la Hague are, the lighthouse on the summit of the Gros du Raz rock, bearing W. 1 S. half a mile from the Cape ; the tower of Jobourg church, standing at the distance of 1 J miles E. by S. from the Nez ; the village of Auderville, the church of which has a small tower, not very visible; and the church of St. Germain de Vaux, with its square tower surmounted by a spire.

The light is dioptric and of the first order, and visible in clear weather from a distance of 18 miles. dangers off CAPE de la HAGUE. \u2014 The coast arouftd Cape de la Hague, from H miles to the southward of the Gros du Raz rock to the Houffet rocks, is skirted by many dangers, which are rendered formidable by the great violence of the tides in their vicinitj-. The local pilots, under favourable circumstances, will sometimes take vessels, under 15 feet draught, along the shore within the rocks which are detached from the beach, for during fine weather tlie tides are less rapid and the sea less dis turbed there than in the wide channel of the Alderney Race. No vessel, however, should attempt this passage without an experienced pilot. Tlie principal dangers in the vicinity of the Cape are, the Greniquet, Diotret, Foraine, Grunes, Becchue, Ronde, and the Houflct rocks. Le Greniquet, the summit of which is 8 sect above high-water springs, lies 3 cables from the shore, abreast Calenfrier, and S.S.W. a mile from the lighthouse on the Gros du Raz. Le Diotret bears N.N.E. 8-| cables from the Greniquet, and its summit, which is 26tt feet above low water, is covered at high equinoctial tides. La Foraine, the westernmost rock in the vicinity ofthe Cape, lies nearly a mile from the shore, and W. | S. three-quarters of a mile from the light house on the Gros du Raz. It is of a conical form, uncovers 14 feet at the lowest tides, and is considered by the seamen of this locality a half tide rock, and to them a valuable mark, because as soon as it is covered the stream of flood begins to be felt in the Race of Alderney, and the stream of ebb directly it uncovers ; it is, however, extremely dangerous to vessels passin\"* in its vicinity, on account of the streams setting directly over it. The steeple of Les Picux church, standing on the high land to the eastward of Cape Fiamanviile, in one with the large rock forming the extremity of the Nez-de-Jobourg, leads 3 cables' lengths to the westward of the Foraine; but this church will not be visible except in very clear weather. Ses Noires. \u2014 The space to the north-east of the Foraine, between it and the Gros du Raz, is filled up with shoals and the rocks called the Noires, the highest of which lies midway between the lighthouse and the Foraine, and uncovers 21 feet. A sunken rock r*amed the Galet, with only a foot water on it, lies N.N.E. \u00a3 E. half a mile from the lighthouse. La Grande Crane, a dangerous rocky reef, on the shoalest part of which there are only 2 feet water, lies N.E. J N. about three-quarters of"], [22, "6 CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO CAPE BARFLEUR. [CHAP.

La Petite Grune. \u2014 This reef, about a quarter of a mile in length in a N.E. and S.W. direction, and on the middle of which are two rocky heads which uncover about a foot, lies E.S.E. 3\u00a3 cables' lengths from the Grande Grune, and about half a mile from the shore, and the sea breaks with great fury during a weather tide, both upon it and the Grande Grune. The north-eastern extreme of the Houffet rocks in one with the Esquina rock (this rock lies near the eastern shore of St. Martin bay, and is the largest and highest rock of all those which lie near the coast between Cape de la Hague and Omonville) bearing S.E. \u00a3 E. will lead a cable's length to the northward of the northern head. La Becchue, a large rock, lying about 4 cables from the shore and E. \u00a7 N. 1^ miles from the lighthouse, is the northernmost of all the rocks which do not cover between the lighthouse, and St. Martin bay, and its summit rises 4 feet above high-water springs. At low water a number of rocky heads appear in a circuit ofa quarter ofa mile around the Becchue ; the westernmost of these heads, which uncovers 4 feet and is named the Porchet, lies about midway between the Becchue and the Petite Grune. La Ronde, lying N.E. N. 2 cables from the Becchue, uncovers 5 feet at the lowest tides, and is in the shape of an oven. At 4 cables to the S.E. by E. of the Becchue is the outer extreme of the Houffet rocks, upon which there are several heads that never cover; they are, however, not more than 3 or 4 feet above high-water springs. gouey. \u2014 This grounding place, on a beach of pebbles and gravel at the head of a small elbow in the shore, lies about half a mile to the southward of the lighthouse on the Gros du Raz, and is sheltered from the land winds from N.N.W., round North and East, to S.S.W. It was also protected from the great swell which sometimes rolls in from the westward by a short stone jetty and the rocks upon which it was built; but it is now abandoned, in consequence of a greater part of the jetty havin\" been thrown down, and there being at times a heavy surf behind what remains standing. The entrance to this harbour bears E. \u00b1 N. 3 cables' lengths from the Diotret rock, and is formed between two large rocks joining the shore ; the rock on the south side, named the Jet d'Amont, is awash at high-water neaps, and that on the north side, the Jet dAval, is about 2 feet above that level. The harbour dries 11 or 12 feet above the lowest tides, and there are 10 to 15 feet water in it at high-water springs, and 6 to 7 feet at neaps,"], [23, "7 CHAP. I.] GOURY. FOSSE DE LA HAGUE. but it is inaccessible during strong N.W. or S.W. winds, on account of the heavy sea; and in every case, since it can only be entered at the time of high water on the shore, that is when the stream is at its greatest speed in the Race of Alderney, the approach to it must always be difficult and often dangerous, and no vessel should attempt it without a local pilot. It is high water, full and change, in the harbour at 7h. 6m. directions. \u2014 When approaching Cape de la Hague from the westward, it should be borne in mind that the north-eastern stream of tide, between the period of half flood and of half ebb on the shore, sets very strongly round the Cape. Flamanville church tower, however, seen exactly halfway in the interval which separates the Nez-de-Jobourg and Cape Flamanville, S. \\ E. will lead a sufficient distance to the westward of the Cape so as to have nothing to fear from being drawn by the stream, whether flood or ebb, amongst the rocks in its vicinity. Vessels coming from the eastward, and coasting a little too near the shore between Cherbourg and Cape de la Hague, are liable to be drawn into the Race of Alderney if they do not keep 7 or 8 miles from the coast when to the westward of Cherbourg. The Race may also be avoided by keeping 1 or 2 miles north ofthe line of the two windmills on Alderney seen in one ; because it is nearly in that direction that the separation of the streams of ebb, that which runs towards the Race, and that which passes north of Alderney, takes place. In clear weather, these windmills may be seen from the masthead from abreast of St. Martin bay. If overtaken by a calm they should anchor if within 7 or 8 miles of the land. The pilots recommend a position in about 20 fathoms water, a little to the northward or north eastward of the Mermistin rock, which lies about a mile from the shore, between Omonville and Querqueville point. fosse de la Hague. \u2014 The soundings around Cape de la Hague are very irregular, from whence proceed the violent eddies in its vicinity, which are caused by the great mass of water flowing towards the Cape during the north-eastern stream. At 3 miles West from the lighthouse on the Gros du Raz, commences the southern part ofthe Deep, named the Fosse de la Hague, which from thence trends to the north-eastward, and termi nates at 3^ miles from the coast on the meridian of the eastern part of St. Martin bay.

The western point of the bay is the termination ofa projecting range of hills, on the top of which stands the church of St. Germain de Vaux, aud may be easily known by the Herbeuses rocks, which form a sort osprolonga tion of it, and also by a fort commanding the approach to a tolerably good anchorage to the E.S.E. and S.E. of the point, where small craft find shelter from winds between W.N.W., round westerly, and S.S.E., but where they would be greatty exposed if it should blow strong from the north-eastward. The Herbeuses are large rocks rising from 30 to 40 feet above high-water springs, and are joined to the western point of the bay by rocks which uncover, and which extend N.N.E. 3 cables in a direct line from that point. The ground is foul around the Herbeuses, and shoal patches with only from 1 to 3 feet water on them, lie N.E., E.S.E.., and S.S.E. H cables from their northern extremity. The western shore of the bay is precipitous, and bordered by rocks which uncover at low water; but in its south-west angle, at the entrance of the valley of St. Germain de Vaux, there is a small beach of pebbles and gravel which covers at the first half-hour's flood. A similar beach forms the head of the baj-, and halfway up the hill, behind the beach, stands the church and village of St. Martin. The eastern shore of the bay is low, but the adjoining land rises gently to the top of a spur of hills running out towards Jardeheu point, and separating the rivulet whicli passes St. Martin from that which empties itself into Omonville harbour. From the middle ofthe beach at the head of St. Martin bay to Jardeheu point the shore is bordered by rocks which dry at low water ; outside of these rocks are others lying in separate groups, the most remarkable of which are the Martiauroc and the Esquina ; the former is covered only at great springs, but the latter is one of the largest rocks in the bay, and has two heads very near each other, one of which rises 30 feet above the highest tides. Several ledges, some of which uncover, extend half a mile to the north-west of the Martiauroc, and form a sort of causeway terminated by a rock with only 3 feet water on it. The opening into the bay is about three-quarters of a mile wide between the Herbeuses and the \"Martiauroc, but the only channel by which vessels can enter it and get up to the anchornge under the fort without a pilot is barely a quarter of a mile wide, and is formed between the above 3 feet rock and the ledges lying to the eastward of the Herbeuses, which latter should be kept aboard, when entering, about a quarter the distance between them and the Mar tiauroc, in order to avoid the Parmentit-re."], [25, "9 CHAP.

BASSE du houppet and Le FLIART. \u2014 From the Houffet rocks to the western point of St. Martin bay the coast is bordered by irregular rocks which uncover at low water, and off it there are many shallow patches. The Basse du Houffet, the farthest out, is dangerous only on account of the high sea on it occasioned by the eddies : it lies E. by S. J S. 6 cables from the Houffet rocks, and has 5i fathoms water on it. The Fliart, lying N.N.W. 2 cables from the Herbeuses, is the principal rock of those which uncover along this part ofthe coast; its summit drying 11 feet above the level of the lowest tides. Shoal patches extend E. by N. 3 cables from the Fliart, and upon their outer extremity there are only 6 feet water. pointe jardeheu is a small round hill covered with herbage, and separated from the hills in!a*ad by a narrow isthmus which covers at high tides; upon its summit there is a mass of large rocks, and it may be easily recognised when bearing S.E. or N.W. The point is surrounded by rocks and shoals, which extend 6 cables' lengths to the northward. The largest and most remarkable of these rocks, named the Coque, lies East 3 cables' lengths from the point, and rises 3 feet above the highest tides. A rocky ledge, called the Hures de la Coque, extends N.N.E. 3 cables from the Coque, where the depth is only 5k fathoms, and causes violent eddies, which small vessels must be careful to avoid. It maybe important to know that when one of the rocks on this ledge covers (it lies N.N.E. i E. a cable's length from the Coque, and uncovers 10 feet at the lowest tides) which is near the time of half flood on the shore, the flood stream is running as far out as 2-t or 3 miles from the shore between Omonville and Cherbourg. Basse B-refort, on which there is only 2^ feet water, lies N. byE.iE. half a mile from Jardeheu point, and at the same distance N.N.W. |- W. from the Coque. The marks for this shoal, which is dangerous to coasters, are, the summit of the Esquina rock in one with a village situated half way up the hill to the westward of Jobourg church-tower, and the Coque entirely concealing a large rock named the Foireuse, which lies S.S.E. ?s E. from it. tide streams. \u2014 The sudden change in the direction of the flood or north-east stream after doubling Cape de la Hague occasions to the north east and cast of that Cape a great eddy, which extends even beyond Omonville, and runs along the coast, following a direction opposed to the stream in the offing, for nearly 9 hours, that is, from 2^ hours before, until 6\\ hours after the time of high water on the shore."], [26, "10 CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO CAPE I3ARFLEUR. [cn.vr.i. This eddy begins to form at the opening of St. Martin bay at about half an hour after the flood stream has commenced in Alderney Race, and its speed increases with that stream ; but as it runs to the N.W., and when near the Becchue rock, it comes in almost direct opposition to the tide flowing East and E.S.E. out of the Race, causing a cross sea, which is violent in proportion to the rate of the flowing tide. Towards the time of high water in St. Martin bay, that is, a quarter of an hour after that at Goury, or a quarter of an hour before that at Omonville, when the stream is at its greatest strength, this confused sea extends nearly 1\\ miles from the shcre, to the line on which Jobourg church-tower is seen in one with the Herbeuses rocks. The violence ofthe sea decreases in proportion to the speed of the flood stream, and totally ends about a quarter of an hour before the ebb stream begins in the Race. A similar cross sea takes place around Jardeheu point from the meeting of the eddy which runs to the north-west along the shore at Omonville, with the stream of flood which comes from the W.N.W. between the Esquina rock and the Brefort shoal. This confused sea is also violent, and extends into the offing as far as the line on which Jalletin guard-house is seen in one with the lighthouse on the Gros du Raz. It commences at the same time as that which takes place near the Becchue, but it ends 15 or 20 minutes before high water at Omonville; as soon as it ceases the counter stream or eddy runs round Jardeheu point, and extends without interruption from Omonville to the Houffet rocks. La foireuse is a rock lying midway between the Coque rock and Omonville harbour, close to the outer edge of a rocky flat which runs 2 cables off the intermediate low shore, and its rounded summit is 2 feet above the level of the highest tides. A rocky ledge extends half a mile to the eastward of the Foireuse, and its eastern extremity, on which there are only 4 fathoms water, rises suddenly from soundings of from 17 to 23 fathoms, and lies in the direction of the church-tower at Digulleville seen a quarter of a point open to the southward of the church-tower at Omonville, bearing W.by S. \u00a7 S.

At neap tides the highest rocks of this ledge break the waves,"], [27, "PORT DOMON VILLE. CHAP. I.] 11 and the swell only enters the harbour ; but during high springs, when all the rocks are covered, there is much sea in it. The position of the harbour may be easily recognised from a distance by the village of Omonville, which is situated at the bottom of a valley, the slopes of which are covered with cultivation ; by a large fort erected on the eastern point of the indentation ; by an old semaphore called the Vigie, on the top of the hill, at the foot of which stands the fort ; and by a large mass of rock on the summit of the hill bounding the valley to the north. Tbe harbour is only 2 cables long from east to west, and barely a cable wide in the space where vessels may anchor between the rocks. The depths increase gradually from the beach on its western shore to 7 fathoms at the entrance. In the deepest part of the harbour the soundings vary from 5 to 7 fathoms over a rocky bottom, in the cavities of which are deposits of stiff yellow mud, where anchors hold firmly ; but as these deposits are of small extent, it is probable that the anchors take hold in the fissures of the rocks. directions. \u2014 Some precaution is necessary when standing for Omon ville harbour with light winds from S.W. or S.E., or during calms after half flood, so as not to miss the entrance. Under these circumstances a vessel should be in a position to the S.E. or S.S.E. of the entrance, so as to have the eddy, which runs 1\\ knots at springs, (noticed at page 10,) favour able for entering. With all other winds, when they are sufficiently strong to ensure stemming this stream, a vessel may run directly for the en trance, taking care, when rounding the rocky ledge, which extends half a mile to the eastward of the Foireuse rock, to have Digulleville church-tower half a point open to the southward of the church-tower at Omonville. The pilots affirm that it is possible to enter the harbour, whatever may be the state of the sea, if a vessel can carry sufficient sail to ensure good steering. There is no difficulty in leaving except with a strong easterly wind. tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in Omonville harbour at 7h. 29m. ; springs rise from 18 to 23 feet, and neaps 13 feet.

From half a mile from Omonville to within three quarters of a mile of Urville church it is high and precipitous, intersected by deep vallies, and terminates in perpendicular cliffs of grey rock, with no remarkable object on it except a peak of rock resembling a wall in ruins, and named Castel Vendon.

The shore along this low part of tbe coast is bordered by a beach of sand, gravel, and rocks, which uncovers at low water, and in several places extends as far out as 3 or 4 cables from the land. Outside the beach there is a rocky bank, with irregular depths on it, extending nearly a mile outside high-water mark. The north-west part of this bank, called Raz de Bannes, lies between the bearings of North and N.E. from Urville church-tower, 'and many of the rocks on it uncover; the highest rock dries 4*- feet at the lowest tides, and N.W., half a mile from it, and at the north-west extremity of the bank lies a small shoal patch, on which there are only 5 feet water. The north-east part ofthe bank is named the Plateau de Nacqueville, the eastern extremity of which is in line with the western part of the Redoute des Couplets (the redoubt stands on the summit ofa hill south of St. Anne bay) in one with the outer wall of the circular battery of Querqueville fort ; large vessels should avoid crossing the plateau at low water, as the tide causes much rippling on it, and a small 9 feet patch lies at 3i cables from the shore. Le 7\u00c6ER3W:iST2N is a rocky flat lying E.S.E. 2 miles from Omonville, and a mile from the cliffs of Castel Vendon. It is about 3]- cables long, east and west, and 2\\ cables broad, with from 7 to 8 fathoms water on it, and 10 to 15 fathoms around it ; Urville and Nacqueville church-towers in one bearing S. by E. point to its eastern end.

I.] POINTE DE QUERQUEVILLE. PORT DE CHERBOURG. 13 from 3^ to 4 knots, when its direction changes again to the southward. One hour after high water it runs S.S.W., but its rate does not exceed a knot, and as its strength decreases, the direction of the stream assumes a more westerly direction, and it finally ends about 2 hours after high water at Cherbourg. The direction of the ebb-stream varies only from West to N.W. from the time of its commencement until 4^ hours after high water at Cherbourg; but as its speed decreases, it turns successively to all the points between. N.W. and West, where it ends Sh. 45m. before high water. Its greatest velocity, about 3-i- knots, occurs from 4 to 5 hours after high water at Cherbourg. The Mermistin lies at the eastern limit of the great eddy noticed in page 10. At 3 or 4 miles to the northward ofthe Mermistin and of Querqueville point the flood stream begins 3 hours before the time of high water at Cherbourg, and ends about 3 hours after high water at that place. Generally speaking, at tbat distance from the coast, eastward of the Mermistin, and also in the middle of the English Channel, the changes of the tide-streams take place at the times of half-flood and half-ebb at Cherbourg.* port de Cherbourg. \u2014 Cherbourg is a sea-port town, naval station, extensive arsenal, and fortress ofthe first class. The town stands at the mouth of the river Divette, and has some trade. Steamers run twice a week to Le Havre, and a railroad was opened in August 1S58, which brings Paris within 9 hours distance. It is in communication by electric telegraph, with Paris, Le Havre, St. Malo, Brest, Toulon, and the chief towns in France. In the year 1856, exclusive of ships of war, 1,256 vessels, amounting to 92,096 tons, and manned by 6,613 seamen, entered inwards, and 1,2G5 vessels cleared outwards. The amount of imports was 151,000/., and of exports 94,000/. The population in 1856, independently of the garrison, was 32,000, of which the labouring classes required for the works in the dock) ard and for the railroad form a large proportion. rade de Cherbourg is comprised in the space formed between Querqueville point and Pelee island, which lie E.S.E. and W.S.W. of each other, distant 3| miles. The road is sheltered on its northern side by a break water, and its southern limits are the shores of St. Anne and Cherbourg bays. The area ofthe sheltered portion ofthe roadstead, of 3 fathoms depth and upwards, is about 1,650 acres; of 4 fathoms and upwards, 1,350 acres; of 5 fathoms and upwards, 900 acres ; and it would contain a fleet of 20 sail * See Admiralty Plan of Port de Cherbourg, No. 2,602 ; scale, m = 6 inches."], [30, "14 [chap. i.

The quieting effect of the breakwater upon the roadstead is very sensible, and vessels now ride in safety, and remain during the winter where formerly they dared not anchor. La DIGUE or breakwater is a magnificent artificial structure which rises from a depth offrom 6 to 7 fathoms at low water, and shelters the roadstead from N.W., round northerly, to N.E. It is formed by a mound of rubblestone deposited a pierre perdue up to the level of low water of equinoctial spring tides. It is 4,060 yards in length, and its base about 100 yards wide, having a long foreshore to seaward; on the harbour side it stands at an angle of 45\u00b0. Upon this foundation is built a wall of masonry, nearly vertical, 33 feet wide at the base, diminishing to 27 feet at the top, which, with the parapet, rises 23 feet above the level of high-water springs. The breakwater does not extend in a straight line, but has two arms of unequal length, diverging 5\u00b0 each towards the harbour. The western arm is about one-third longer than the eastern. The work was begun in the year 1783, but was several times interrupted, and was brought to a close in 1853. The chief engineers employed on it were, De Cessart, De Lamblardie, Cachin, Fouques-Duparc, Virla, Bonnin, and Reibell, and they have constructed a work of whicli France may be justly proud. It is to be armed by a fort in the centre, one at each end, and by an intermediate battery on the western arm. A large black buoy marks the western extreme of the foundation of the breakwater, and a red buoy the eastern extreme.* LIGHTS The approaches to Cherbourg are facilitated at night by three lights, dioptric and of the 4th order. The first is a fixed white light placed in a white tower in Querqueville fort at 59 feet above high water. The second is a fixed white light, with a flash every 3 minutes, exhibited at 66 feet above high water, from a small stone tower, painted white, which stands in fort Central on the breakwater, and which bears from the \u00ab The first idea of sheltering Cherbourg bay by an artificial work dates as far back as 1665; but the first real project was in 1775, by M. de la Bretonniere, Capitaine de Vaisscau. In 1781 the proposal of M. de Cessart, engineer, to form a breakwater by sinking frustra of cones filled with stone was adopted, and the first cone was sunk in 17S4. After IS such cones had been sunk this plan was abandoned in 1788, and that of depositing stone a pierre perdue was adopted and followed up, with occasional intervals, until the breakwater reached above high water, but as in that form it could not withstand the force of the sea, M. Fouques-Duparc proposed, in 1829, a vertical wall of masonry based upon the rubble foundation rising from the level of low water of equinoctial spring tides. Such a wall was begun in 1832 and carried on to completion at the close of 1853. Since then the forts have been in progress.

The farthest out of these is a large rock named the Rochefort, lying at the head of the bay at about 2 cables' lengths from high-water mark and a mile to the south-eastward of Querqueville fort, and its summit rises 2 feet above the level of the highest tides. The water is not deep in this bay, and in some parts there are only 4^ fathoms at low water at half a mile from the shore. Not more than 17 feet will be found at the extremity of a rocky projection which extends 3\\ cables to the eastward from the outer wall of the circular battery on Querqueville point, and only 12 feet at the distance of 4 cables to the south-east from the same part of the fort. A rocky head, upon which there are 14 feet water, lies E. by N. N. half a mile from the Rochefort rock, with the summit of that rock nearly in one with Henneville church-tower, and N.W. 9 cables from Hornet fort. This 14 feet rock is much in the way of large vessels beating in or out of Cherbourg road, and should be avoided at the springs from a third ebb to two-thirds flood, and at all times of tide during neaps. A heavy swell is thrown on the beach of the bay when the wind is strong from N.W. or N.E., and it would be dangerous then to anchor in it, as the bottom is uneven and covered with rocks. Basse Cbavagnac is a small rocky patch lying at the entrance of St. Anne bay, midway between the circular battery of Querqueville fort and the west end of the breakwater. It is about three-quarters of a cable long and from 25 to 30 fathoms broad, and a fort is now, in 1859, in the course of construction on it. The patch breaks with strong gales between N.W. and N.E., and during a weather tide the sea is much agitated on it; it is dangerous to approach in calm weather, as the ebb sets directly over it.

I. baie de Cherbourg is bounded on its western side by the rocks off Hornet fort, and on its eastern side by the Flamands rocks and Pelee island. The town of Cherbourg and the Port du Commerce occupy the head of the bay, and the establishments of the Port Militaire the western side, between the town and Hornet fort. The shore is low from the front of the town to the Flamands, and bordered by a sandy beach a quarter of a mile broad at low water. The low land adjoining the shore of this bay extends but little into the interior, and is bounded by the high hills, between which are the vallies of Roule and Tourlaville. The entrance to Roule valley is south of the floating basin of the Port du Commerce, and between two hills of un equal height. The eastern hill, Mont Roule, is steep and crowned by Roule fort, which commands all the neighbourhood. A telegraph is placed on the top of the western hill. Tourlaville valley is situated to the eastward of Roule valley, and is only separated from the former by a range of hills, of which Mont Roule forms the north-western extremity. The entrance to this valley is wide, but it rapidly narrows farther inland. Rocbes des Flamands lie close to the eastern shore of Cherbourg bay, and their highest parts uncover at low water. A strong fort is now erected on these rocks mounting 70 guns in two tiers, and is approached from the shore by a causeway and drawbridge. The Basse des Flamands, upon which there are only 11 feet water, lies to the northward of the recks, at half a mile from the shore, and is separated from them by a sandy bottom.

The small church-tower at Querqueville kept exactly between the tall spire of that church and the tower of Nacqueville church leads a quarter of a cable to the northward of the dangerous parts of the Tenarde. The eastern end of the shoal is marked by a buoy, moored E.N.E. half a cable from the eastern head. There are from 19 to 21 feet water over rocky bottom between the Tenarde and the shore, with the exception ofa 13 feet patch lying E. | S. 2 cables from the flagstaff of the fort. Port du Commerce or mercantile harbour consists of an Avant-port or outer harbour, with the channel leading to it, and a Bassin de Flot or floating basin, occupying the place of the former mouth of the little river Divette, which waters Roule valley. The channel, the bottom of which is composed of a mixture of sand, mud, gravel, and shingle, and dries at low-water great springs, lies between two stone jetties running parallel with each other, and 55 yards apart. The western jetty is much shorter than the eastern. The position of the channel entrance, which is open to the north-west, is marked by a light tower, painted white, standing on the eastern jetty head. The Avant-port will admit vessels of about 15 feet draught at springs, and 9 or 10 feet at neaps. It is surrounded on three sides by quays built of granite, and is 328 yards long from north to south, 212 yards wide, and dries like the channel at low-water. Its eastern side, where the old naval arsenal stood, is exclusively appropriated to Government vessels, but the southern and western quays, which extend 590 yards, are for the use of merchant vessels. The bottom of the harbour is hard, and except in front ofthe repairing slip, and about half-way along the western quay, where the bare rock is exposed,* it consists ofa mixture of sand, gravel, and a little mud. The bottom at the foot of the quays is level, and dries about 7 feet above the level of the lowest tides, and vessels would lie here in safety were they not exposed to the heavy swell and surf which sets in through the channel when the wind blows between West and North. To remedy this evil a pier has been built in a line perpendicular to the western quay, at 60 yards to the southward of the new repairing slip, and the swell with north-westerly winds breaks in a great measure on the slip and in the space between the pier and the western jetty; but, under all circumstances, vessels should not wait longer in the outer harbour than is necessary for sufficient water to enter the floating basin.

The Bassin de Flot is 440 yards long and 137 yards wide, having an area of 12 acres, or space for about 240 small vessels in winter, when severe weather may oblige them to seek refuge in Cherbourg. It communicates with the outer harbour by gates 42 feet wide, and the water rises above their sill, (which is 15 inches above the level of the lowest tides,) 19 to 21 feet at great springs, 17 to 18^ feet at ordinary springs, and about 13 feet at neaps. The gates remain open about an hour and a half, but they are closed with a falling tide. There are building and repairing slips at the head ofthe basin. As pilots can always board a vessel in the small roadstead, it is un necessary to give directions for entering the channel leading to the Port du Commerce. Port Mllltaire or Dockyard is situated to the north-westward ofthe town of Cherbourg, and occupies a space of about 220 acres of the level land at the foot of the Equerdreville and Couplets hills. It is especially appropriated for vessels of war, and is planned as a first-class naval dockyard ; it is surrounded on both the land and the north sides by a fortified enclosure; Hornet fort being its principal defence towards the sea. The Port, properly so called, consists of three extensive floating basins. The Outer basin or Avant-port, of 16 acres, communicates with the roadstead by a short channel opening to the eastward, in which there are from 13 to 16 feet at low water; and with the Bassin de flot, or nonhern basin, (15 acres) by gates 59 feet wide, having their sill 13^ feet below the level of the lowest tides. Both basins have been formed in the solid rock to a depth of about 32 feet below the same level. Before the eastern arm of the digue or breakwater was raised above tbe level of high-water springs, the southern basin was untenable with strong winds from E.N.E. to E.S.E., but now the surf is much less violent. An inner floating basin, named Bassin Napoleon III., of 20 acres in extent, was opened in August 1858. It has 7 first-class building slips and one dry dock on its west side, 4 docks on the north, and 2 double docks on the south side. There are also 4 building slips on the south side of the a\\ vans-port, making 1 1 in all, and 7 docks. The quays and docks are faced with fine granite from Dielette, Flamanville, and Chausey. On the north side, surrounding the docks, are the steam factory and workshops sot repairing ships. he pelee is the remainder of a long point which extended nearly li miles to the northward from the coast, but which has been separated"], [35, "v'hap. i.] RADE DE CHERBOURG ; PORT MILITAIRE ; ILE PEL^E. 19 from it by the action of the waves, leaving a channel nearly half a mile wide. This island is a flat of bare rock, which at high water is nearlv covered by the waves ; but at low-water springs it is about three quarters of a mile long from north to south, and half a mile broad, presenting the form of a horseshoe, with its opening facing the east ; its highest point is a heap of stones, awash at high-water great springs. Fort Imperial stands on the western point of the island, and defends the eastern entrance to Cherbourg road. The south-western bastion of the fort has a flagstaff on it, and afixed ichite light is exhibited from the north eastern bastion ; both bastions are sufficiently high to be seen at the distance of 10 or 12 miles from seaward.

Basse du chenal is a rocky ledge about a cable in diameter, several parts of which are nearly awash al low water. It lies at the western edge of the narrow channel which separates Pe'ee island from the main, at a third of a mile from the shore, and S. W. 6 cables from the light on fort Imperial. The spire of Querqueville church, seen between the small tower of that church and an isolated house standing on the high ground south of the village of Nacqueville, points to the centre of the ledge. Basse de Hapetout, a small isolated rocky patch with only 15 feet on it, forms the north-eastern extremity of the dangers off Pelee island. It lies E. 5 N. nearly a mile from the light on fort Imperial, with the high battery of Hornet fort just open to the northward of the lower battery of fort Imperial, and the small houses adjoining the eastern part of the barrack at the Becquets de Denneville in one with the houses ofa farm standing on the height above the limestone quarries, called the Becquet cliffs. A little to the westward of the Happetout is another patch with 3 fathoms on it. The rocky flat of Pelee island extends 2 cables' lengths in a northerly direction from the north side of the island, and as the sea is always disturbed upon it, and the soundings vary from 9 to 23 feet, it will be prudent for vessels to avoid approaching too near its northern edge, which they may do by keeping the spire of Querqueville church open to the northward of fort Central.

Ea Trulte rock, lying on the west point of the flat at the eastern edge of the eastern channel into Cherbourg road, is about half a cable long from east to west, and 30 fathoms broad.

The position of this rock is marked by a buoy similar to that on the north-west point of the flat, but it is painted red, and surmounted by a tin vane also painted red.

The bottom in the northern part ofthe road is for the most part composed of schistose rock in a state of decomposition, and the holding ground is good ; immediately to the southward of this rock the bottom is of fine muddy sand, which is not sufficiently stiff to hold well, but it improves on nearing the shore, and holds well in the southern part of the road, particularlysouth ofthe line on which Nacqueville church-tower is in one with the spire of Querqueville church. A short distance, however, to the southward of this line there is not sufficient depth for large vessels to anchor at low water, and it would be too near the shore. The pilots moor vessels S.E. and N.W., and veer cable to meet the alternate streams of flood and ebb ; but as the streams are generally weak, it would, perhaps, be advisable to moor with open hawse to the N.W. to withstand the winds from that quarter, whicli are frequent. Fresh winds from N.W. to North throw a heavy sea into some parts of the road, but it is sheltered from strong N.N.E. winds ; those from E.N.E. to E.S.E. raise a heavy swell only from the time of half flood to half ebb on the shore. Mouillage de l'Ouest or western anchorage lies about 2 cables to the southward of the western arm of the breakwater, and has a bottom of fine sand and broken shells extending 8 cables from east to west, and carrying a depth of from 7 to 8 fathoms water. The sea was very heavy at this anchorage with strong winds from N.N.E. to N.W., before the works of the breakwater were finished, but now vessels of all sizes are able to ride safely in it with their own anchors. Ea Petite-Rade has good holding ground, and lies to the southward of the Grand-Rade in the space which is sheltered by Hornet fort from westerly winds and the sea occasioned by them. Its northern limit is considered to be the line on which the outer wall of the round battery on Querqueville point is seen opening and shutting of Hornet fort; to the southward of this line the soundings decrease rather rapidly from 26 to 16 feet. At about 2 cables to the north-westward of the good anchorage in the road lie two small isolated rocky banks occupying together a space of about a cable's length from S.W. to N.E. ; there are 26 feet upon the shoalest part of the northern bank, and 28 feet upon the southern bank, which is the smaller and lies upon the line which marks the northern limit of the road. Vessels anchor in the Petite-Rade awaiting sufficient water to enter the Port du Commerce ; it was also used by those seeking refuge before the eastern arm of the breakwater was raised above high water, but they now prefer anchoring close to the breakwater.

Strong gales from S.W. to S.E. are very much felt at this anchorage, and vessels are liable to be driven out close to the breakwater, where, with such winds, the sea is greatly disturbed. The Anchorage between Banc de l'lle Pelee and the Eastern Arm of the Breakwater is used by merchant vessels when seeking shelter in Cher bourg road from severe weather from N.N.W. round northerly, to E.N.E. Its limits are from the meridian of fort Central, where it is 1\\ cables broad, to about 11 cables to the westward of the eastern extremity of the breakvvater, where it is only 1^ cables' broad. The bottom at this anchor age is sand, mixed in some places with a little mud, and the depth, which decreases towards the bank, varies from 26 to 32 feet ; vessels should not anchor here with strong winds from W.N.W., round southerly, to S.S.E., as the holding ground then is not good. CHANNEES into rabe de Cherbourg Ships of war and vessels of large draught enter Cherbourg road by the channels lying at the two extremities of the breakwater.

Passe de l'Ouest. \u2014 There is no difficulty in entering this channel with a leading wind, but vessels of large draught turning in with the flood stream must be careful to avoid the Chavagnac, also the rocky head of 14 feet lying E. by N. N. half a mile from the Rochefort rock, and the Tenarde shoal ; it would be imprudent to turn through at night, except during very fine moonlight. The leading mark through at night when the moon is near the horizon, and its light sufficiently strong to dis tinguish Hornet fort, is the red light on the eastern jetty of the Port du Commerce kept a little open to the westward of the upper battery on that fort ; but in a dark night in a sailing vessel it would not be safe to trust to it, especially on the flood. The Channel between fort de Querqueville and the Basse Chavagnac is not so wide as the western channel, and it ought only to be used by large ships in cases of absolute necessity, and then only between half flood and half ebb. No sailing vessel should attempt it during calm weather, as there would be great risk of being drifted upon the rocks at the head of St. Anne bay by the eddy on the flood caused by Querqueville point ; neither would there be any advantage in hugging the shore of this bay with land winds, as they frequently come in gusts from the openings of the vallies. particularly when it blows hard from the south-west."], [39, "CHAP. ].] 23 CHANNELS INTO RADE DE CHERBOURG. Passe de l'Est or eastern channel into Cherbourg road lies between the eastern extremity ofthe breakwater and the black and red buoys which mark the two most dangerous spots on the western edge of Pelee island flat, viz., the north-west point of the flat, and the Truite rock. The narrowest part of the channel is 2^ cables wide between the breakwater and the Truite buoys, and has from 28 to 32 feet in it at low water, but besides being narrow, this channel has the disadvantage of being crossed obliquely by the tide streams, rendering it dangerous for sailing vessels with light winds, and impracticable during calms; there is, however, no difficulty or danger in a steamer or with a commanding breeze. Vessels coming from the eastward, and intending to run through this channel on the flood, should be careful to give a good berth to the north west point of Pelee island flat, as that stream sets strongly towards it, and not to get into the exact line of tbe channel until the point is passed. Formerly the beacon, which stood on the rocks N. % E. from the square tower of Cherbourg church, in one with the tower of Octeville church bearing S.W. by W., would lead through the channel and over Pelee island bank, which has not less than 22 feet on this part of it at the lowest tides, and may be passed over by vessels of the largest draught between half flood and half ebb ; but as this beacon has recently been removed, it will be advisable to approach the channel with Octeville and Cherbourg churches in line, S.W. by W. \u00a3 W., until within a mile of that island, when the black buoy on the north-west point of the flat will be seen. The Channel to the southward of Pelee island trends in a W. by N. and E. by S. direction, 5^ cables long, and a cable broad, and carries a depth of about 6 feet at low water in its western part, and from 2 to 6 feet in its eastern. It is bounded on the northern side by the Basse du Chenal and the rocks to the south and south-east of Pelee island ; and on its southern side by the low-water rocks along the shore, the highest of which, named the Vieille (or old woman) by the fishermen, dries 10 feet above the level of the lowest tides, and covers at a third-flood.

On nearing these islets great care must be taken not to get to the southward of them, particularly while the tide is flowing on their shores, for should this precaution be neglected, there would be great risk of being drawn into the channel which separates them from Guernsey, and eventually to be obliged to cross Alderney Race at the time the sea is most agitated there. Having arrived at a position about 9 miles N.W. cf the Casquets, the best courses to steer will be as follows: \u2014 First, E. by S. 14 miles, to get on the meridian of the western point of Alderney, so as to bring the Casquets to bear S.W. by W. i W., and the lighthouse at Cape de la Hague S.E. | S. ; then E.S.E. 11 miles, which will lead to a position where the Nez-de-Jobourg and the Calenfrier are in one, and the lighthouse at the Cape bears S.S W. J- W. ; and, lastly, S.S.E. 14 miles, which will lead to the entrance of the western channel into Cherbourg road. The above are the best courses that can be steered by large vessels with winds between N.N.E., round northerly and W.S.W., for they will lead a safe distance outside the dangers, and also outside the strong streams of tide running through the Ortach and tlie Singe channels and Alderney Race, which must be guarded against during springs, in order not to be drifted too far to the northward ; for, if with south-west winds and during the flood, the meridian of Cape de la Hague should be crossed at 6 or 7 miles from the shore, a sailing vessel may possibly miss the entrance to Cherbourg road. With the wind between W.S.W. and S.S.W. a S.E. by E. i E. course may be shaped from the above position, (N.W. 9 miles from the Casquets,) which will lead about 2 miles from the shore on the meridian of tbe Cape, and the * The most practical pilot ut Cherbourg, also a yacht sailor who has been many years in the habit of sailing along this part of tbe French coast, and is thoroughly conversant with its navigation and tides, recommend that a stranger approaching Cherbourg from the westward should sight Portland in preference to the Casquets, and then shape a course about half a point to the westward of Cape Barfleur.

At Nigbt. \u2014 Approaching the western channel into Cherbourg road at night, when to the eastward of Cape de la Hague, keep the light at that Cape in sight over the land, until the light in Querqueville fort bears S.S.W., then stand to the southward until the light in fort Imperial is to the southward of fort Central light ; the seaman must then be guided by the red light on the west end of the breakwater. The most unfavourable winds for a sailing vessel to approach Cherbourg from the Casquets are those from the eastward, and especiall}' a S.E. wind. With moderate winds, however, from these quarters, when the sea is generally smooth, and during the flood, the passage is not difficult ; but on the ebb it is absolutely impossible, and she should then make a long board to the northward and endeavour to hold her own until the stream slacks ; the shore should then again be approached, to take ad vantage of the first of the flood, and long boards made to endeavour to reach the road, or a position to the eastward of its meridian, so as to be able to enter with the latter part of the flood or the beginning of the ebb. Calms and fogs are mostly to be feared when making this passage, on account ofthe great strength of the streams, and under either of these cir cumstances every effort should be made to get into the middle of the Channel, where the streams are much weaker than near the French coast.

When standing towards Cape Bar fleur during the flood, do not go into less than 20 fathoms water, which depth will be found at about 2 miles from the Cape, in order to avoid being drawn into the bay of the Seine or into Barfleur race, where the tide runs with great violence ; the same distance and depth should also be preserved on the ebb, to keep outside the race and the disagreeable sea off tbat Cape on a weather tide. Care must also be taken not to come into a less depth than 26 fathoms between Cape Barfleur and Cape Levi, as the dangers between these capes extend 1\\ miles from the coast; and a berth of 2 miles should be given to the latter Cape to avoid the foul ground off it. Large vessels turning to windward between Cape Levi and Pelee island should not stand farther to the southward than to have Querqueville. church spire in one with the northern end of fort Central on the breakwater, to avoid being embayed between the Cape and the island, where a sudden shift of wind might place them in difficulty, and also to avoid the dangers on Pelee island flat; at night they should go about when the light in fort Central bears W. by N. Sailing vessels bound to tbe Westward from Rade de Cherbourg should not leave until the wind is sufficiently settled to carry them clear of the English Channel. They generally go out through the western channel at the commencement ofthe ebb, but after rounding Hornet fort they borrow towards the breakwater to avoid in light winds drifting on the Chavagnac rock, the ebb making directly over it. When on the meridian of Cape de la Hague, and 6 or 7 miles from t, they steer W.N.W. until the Casquets bear S.S.E., when a W. by S. course will take them out of the Channel. These courses will lead out of the influence of the streams running through the Casquet and the Singe channels and Alderney Race, and in the direction of the streams in the offing, and also sufficiently near the island of Ouessant to admit of taking a departure from it. If obliged to cross the Race, vessels should endeavour to leave Cherbourg road at such a time as will enable them to be at the entrance of the Race towards half ebb on the shore, that is, at the end of the flood stream in that channel, aud they should then steer so as to pass through the centre of it. When bound to tbe Eastward from Rade de Cherbourg with a westerly wind, weigh towards half flood, or if in the floating basin of the Port du Commerce, quit it as soon as the gates are open, and run out of the eastern channel noticed in page 23.

TIDES. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in the Port du Commerce, at 7h. 49m., and the water rises above the sill of the floating basin (which is 15 inches above the level of the lowest tides), about 19 to 21 feet at great springs, 17 to 18^ feet at ordinary springs, and 13 feet at neaps. Strong winds from the westward cause the tide in the Avant port to rise one or two feet above that during calm weather, and easterly winds have a contrary effect. With violent westerly winds at the springs, the sea frequently flows over the quays of the outer harbour. The mean duration ofthe flood is 5h. 45m., and of the ebb 6h. 35m. The flood stream begins to be felt in the Grande-Rade half an hour after the time of low water on the shore, and ceases three-quarters of an hour after high water; its direction is S.E., and its rate about 2 -knots. The greatest speed of the ebb stream, which runs to the N.W,, hardly ever exceeds 1^ knots, unless the wind is strong from N.E. or East. In the Mouillage de l'Ouest the flood stream commences about an hour after low water on the shore, and ends an hour after high water. The streams are feeble throughout the whole extent of this anchorage, and also in the eastern part of it. The Petite-Rade lies in the eddy of the flood stream occasioned by the projection of Hornet point. This eddy extends as far as the northern limit of the road, and forms a counter stream, which sweeps along the shore to the W.N.W. from about 3 or 4 cables to the eastward of the en trance to the Port du Commerce to the head of the bay, then north along the boundary wall of the dockyard. It begins at about half-flood on the shore, and continues until high water; its greatest velocity is about 1^ knots at springs, decreasing towards high water. The ebb stream follows in the same direction, and at half-ebb, when it is at its greatest strength, its rate is about 2 knots. At about half a mile to the northward of the western channel into Cher bourg road the flood stream, which runs towards the S.S.E. and S.E., commences about 1^ hours after low water on the shore, and ends lh. 20m. after high water, and its greatest speed is 3 knots. The ebb runs towards the N.W. by N. at nearly the same rate. Iu the channel the first direction the flood takes is S.S.W., but as it gains its greatest strength, which is about 2 knots at springs, it inclines towards the S.S.E. The direc tion ofthe ebb varies from N.N.W. to N.W., and its rate is nearly the same as that of the flood. The flood ceases at the western end ofthe breakwater about an hour after high water in Port Militaire. The flood stream begins to be felt in the eastern channel into Cher bourg road at one hour after low water on the shore, and ceases at one"], [44, "28 [chap. I.

Its direction is E. by S. between the breakwater and Truite buoys, and its greatest speed, which takes place at 4 to 5 hours flood on the shore, is 1\\ knots ; but a little to the northward of this position the stream runs East, and its rate is 3^ knots. At the north-west point of Pelee island flat, as well as on the northern edge of it, its direction is E.N.E., and its greatest velocity 4 knots. The eddies formed by the uneven rocks on the flat produce a violent and dangerous race. The ebb experiences fewer variations, and its rate is rather less than the flood. It runs along the northern edge of Pelee island, and from thence West until the rocks are uncovered; but outside the flat and the breakwater its direction is W.N.W. The streams between Pelee island and the land run E.S.E. and W.N.W., and their greatest strength is from 1\\ to 3 knots. Tbe coast between Pelee island and Cape Levi, which bear from each other E.I S. and W. \\ N. distant 4 miles, forms a deep bight, into which sailing vessels should avoid getting embayed. From the Flamands rocks to the middle of this bight the shore is low and broken into small projections, the most remaikable of which is Heu point, in front of Brette ville village. At a short distance inland are the calcareous cliffs, called the Becquets quarries, which form one of the most remarkable objects in the neighbourhood of Cherbourg. Brique point, the steep sides of which are covered with verdure, is also conspicuous on this coast. It bears E. \\ N. 1^ miles from Heu point, and on it is a mound ; and at a cable's length to the W.S.W. of this mound is a similar mound, called Le Castel, on the top of which stands a coast guard house. port DE becquets, at three-quarters of a mile to the westward of Heu point, is situated in front of a group of houses built close to the shore. It is nothing but a grounding place, surrounded by quays of dry stone work about a cable long and half a cable wide, in which there are only from 12 to 15 feet at high-water springs, and is especially intended for the boats that carry away the stone obtained from the Becquets quarries. Ees grunes de brettevieee is the name given to the rocky bottom, three-quarters of a mile wide, extending off perpendicularly from the shore between Heu and Brique points, to where the tower of Nacqueville church is seen in one with the Happetout rock, which forms the north- east point of Pelee island. The depths over this bottom are tolerably regular, from 13 feet near the shore, to 10 fathoms about a mile off.

At 3 or 4 cables to the West and W.N.W. of the jetty there is good holding ground in 9 fathoms, over muddy bottom, where vessels bound to the eastward with adverse winds may wait in safety during the ebb. This anchorage is protected by fort Levi, which is built on the northern point of the bay. cape eevi is a low point, which terminates to the northward some slightly elevated hills detached from the high lands of the interior. On the highest parts of these hills stand two houses, very close to each other, which may be seen afar off; the northernmost is an old semaphore and the other a guard-house. Several rocky patches which uncover extend as far as 4 cables to the north-east from the Cape. The outermost patch is terminated by a remarkable rock, called the Bieroc, which has a rounded head rising 5 or 6 feet above high water.* RAZ du cap eevi is the name given to the strong eddies occasioned by the uneven rocky ground, which extends N. by E. E. 2 miles from the extremity ofthe Cape. This rocky ground in some places is half a mile wide, and considerably elevated above the general level of the bottom, and, as it lies across the direction of the tidal streams, the eddies it makes cause a heavy sea, particularly during a weather tide. It is stated by the local pilots that this race at springs, with strong easterly winds on the flood, is as dangerous and as much agitated as Alderney Race. Some patches rising from this rocky bottom are dangerous, even for small vessels, at all times of tide; they are named the Bieroc, the Basse du Cap Levi, the Pierre Noire, and the Tete Septentrionale or Northern Head of the race. Ee Bieroc is a small rocky patch of only 3 feet at low water, lying ]1 cables to the northward of the Bieroc rock, from which it derives its name. Basse du Cap Eevi is a rocky ledge about 2 cables long in a N.N.W.. and S.S.E. direction, and 1^ cables broad, and on its south-east point is a dangerous 13 feet patch, lying N.N.W. \\ W. half a mile from the Bieroc rock. Ea Pierre Noire or Black rock, lying N. \u00a7 E. one mile from the summit of the Bieroc, is one of the most dangerous rocks in the race, having only 7 feet on it at the lowest tides. * The lighthouse in course of erection on Cape Levi is intended to exhibit a fired white light ofthe 4lh order, varied every 3 minutes by a red flash."], [46, "30 [chap. i.

There are 33 feet on tbis rocky head at low water, but as it rises precipitously from soundings of from 19 to 25 fathoms, it causes great eddies, and the sea breaks upon it in bad weather. Vessels of moderate draught, under charge of pilots, may, if the weather permits, cross the race in the channel between the Basse du Cap Levi and the Pierre Noire even at low water ; but large vessels of war should always pass to the northward of the race. The coast between Cape Levi and Cape Barfleur, which are distant 8 miles from each other and lie on the same parallel of latitude, is generally low and sandy, but the adjacent lands rise at a short distance from the shore, and are joined by slight undulations to the hilis in the interior, the highest of which are Carneville heath, the woody mound at St. Pierre, the hills bounding Saire valley, and La Pernelle hill. anse de la iwondree lies immediately to the eastward of Cape Levi, between the Bieroc and Blanche rocks. It is about 1^ miles wide and three-quarters of a mile deep, and good anchorage will be found on its western side, in 7^ fathoms, over muddy bottom, where vessels turning to windward against westerly winds may wait during the flood; but it must not be used except in the finest weather, for should they be surprised in it by strong winds from N.W. to N.E. and it become necessary to weigh during the flood, they would be drifted amongst the numerous dangers lying off the coast to the eastward.

The local fishermen state that, in a case of necessity, a vessel could be saved by running into it at high water, if under 12 feet draught. The cove is about half a cable wide and a cable deep, and the rocks bordering its sides are always uncovered.

Ee Sen, is a small isolated rock just awash at the lowest tides, lying 8 cables from the shore, in a N.E. by N. direction from Coqueville church. Basses du sen. \u2014 These shoals are numerous, and form separate patches, extending to the west, north, and east of the Sen rock. The shoal lying to the northward of the rock is 8 cables long and 3-j cables broad, and has two dangerous rocky heads on it, on one of which there are only 4-| feet water ; on the other head, which from its position is called the Tete du Milieu, or Middle head, there are 5-| feet. To the north-west of this shoal lie four isolated rocky heads, with from 21 to 31 feet water over them ; the outer of these heads, named Tete du Nord-Ouest, or North-west head, lies with Gatteville church tower in one with a rock, (which is awash at the highest neaps,) at Neville point bearing S.E. \u00a7 S., and Saint-Pierre-Eglise tower S. by W. -1 W. and in one with a house at Coqueville, which on that bearing appears to stand a little to the right of the church tower of that village. A fifth rocky head, with 9 fathoms on it, lies N. by E. \\ E. three quarters of a mile from the Middle head, with the flashing light on Cherbourg breakwater bearing W. S. 9-fc miles, and the revolving light at Cape Barfleur E. !_\u25a0 N., but it is only dangerous on account of the heavy sea occasioned* by the eddies. There are no dangers between the Sen shoals and Cape Levi race, and 6 and 7 fathoms water will be found at the outer edges of the rocks and banks, which extend as far as 6 cables from the coast. Ee Renier, a small rock uncovering 4 feet, lies a mile from the shore at the northern angle of a rocky flat of a triangular shape, the base of which is towards the shore. This flat has a number of rocky heads on it, which uncover at low water. Basses du Renier. \u2014 These shoals lie from one to 1-J miles to the north east and north of the Renier rock, and form three distinct patches, named Basse du Sud-Est, Basse du Centre, and Basse du Nord-Ouest; the former has 21 feet on it at low water, and the Centre shoal 15 feet. The Basse du Nord-Ouest, the outermost ofthe dangers between Cape Levi and Cape Barfleur, lies about 2^ miles from the shore, and less than a quarter of a mile within the 21 fathoms' line of soundings bordering the coast. The least water on it is 26 feet, from which depth the revolving light at Cape Barfleur bears S.E. by S. 5-^ miles, and the flashing light on Cherbourg breakwater W. \\ S. 10T4y miles.

[chap. I. from 14 to 19 fathoms, it occasions eddies which are dangerous to cross during strong winds. The eddies caused by the Renier and Sen shoals also raise a heavy sea during a weather tide. Ea Roquette, a small isolated rocky patch of only 4 feet water, lies N.N.E. about 1^ miles from Neville point, and N.W. by N. from Cape Barfleur lighthouse. There is another patch, with 5 fathoms on it, lying S.S.E. 2 cables from the Roquette ; and many others lie between the Roquette and the Renier. Plateau des Equets, a rocky ridge lying about S.E. by S. one mile from the Roquette, and N.W. by N. 2 miles from Cape Barfleur lighthouse, is of a circular form, about 3 cables in diameter, and has four dangerous heads on it, the highest of which rises from its southern part and uncovers nearly 2 feet at low water ; there are from 2 to 5 feet on the other heads. Haut-Fond des Equets, a rocky patch of 28 feet water, with from 10 to 12 fathoms around it, lies 1| miles from the coast, 5i cables to the north ward of the Equets ridge, and about N.N.W. 2-^ miles from Cape Barfleur lighthouse. The marks for it are : \u2014 the tower of Saint-Pierre- Eglise seen between the church tower and the redoubt at Retoville, and the small tower of Gatteville church in one with a powder magazine standing on the shore near the guard-house at Gatteville.

At night, in clear weather, a bearing of the light on Cherbourg breakwater or the light on Cape Barfleur will greatly assist the mariner in avoiding these dangers, which must not be approached within the depth of 26 fathoms; but in thick weather, vessels should keep off the coast as the lead will not be a sufficient guide. tides.\u2014 The flood stream at 1\\ miles from the coast, between Cape Levi and Cape Barfleur, commences about the time of half-flood on the"], [49, "CHAP.

From the northern part of Cape Levi race to 2 or 3 miles in the offing, the direction of both streams, during their greatest strength at springs, is East and West, and the rate of tbe flood is from 3i to 4 knots, and the ebb something less. Outside the Sen and Renier shoals, and also amongst them, their direction is E.S.E. and W.N.W., and their rate about the same ; but as the meridian of Cape Barfleur is approached the flood stream inclines more to the south-east, and its strength increases.

Two towers of unequal height stand at the extremity of the point, and serve to mark its position by day. The highest or southern tower,* in lat. 49\u00b0 41' 52\" N., long. 1\u00b0 16' 2\" W., exhibits a ichite light, dioptric and of the first order, which revolves every half minute. The light is elevated 236 feet above high water, and may be seen in clear weather from the distance of 22 miles ; beyond the distance of 12 miles the eclipses are total between the bright faces, but within 12 miles there is a faint continuous light. When the sun shines on these towers, the southern tower may be seen at the distance of 15 or 16 miles, and the old or northern tower at 11 or 12 miles. They are difficult to distinguish when at some distance to the North or N.E. of them on account of the high land at their back; this land, however, having a remarkable break in its formation, will assist to mark their position, \u2014 it is the valley of the little river Saire, called Coupee du Vaast, which lies S.W. by W. \u00a3 W. 5-J- miles from the lighthouse. La Pernelle hill is also a remarkable object, and attracts particular notice by the church on its summit; it rises about S.W. \u00a7- S. 5 miles from the lighthouse, and when seen from the S.S.E., the N.N.E., or the N.N.W., it has the appearance of a promontory sloping gradually towards the sea. raz de barfeeur. \u2014 This race is occasioned by the violence with which the flood and ebb streams precipitate themselves over the rocks forming a submarine extension from Cape Barfleur.

They form three separate reefs; the first, with from 7 to 25 feet water on it, extends E. by N. half a mile from the lighthouse; the second reef, separated from the first by a deep called the Breche-du-Raz, has a rock with only 17 feet over it, lying E. 1 S. about 6| cables from the lighthouse ; the third reef, named the Riden de Quenanville, lies to the southward of the others, and is separated from them by another deep about 4 cables wide. This latter reef, 2 cables broad, extends half a mile in an E.S.E. and W.N.W. direction, and its shoalest spot of 7 feet lies with Reville church spire in one with the western side of a cluster of houses at the chateau of Monfarville,* and the guard-house on the summit of the eastern point of Roubaril cove touching the southern part of the highest of the houses which serve as dwellings for the light-keepers, and which stand about l\u00a3 cables to the south-west ofthe lighthouse. Barfleur race is dangerous at the springs when the streams rush through it at the rate of 8 or 9 knots, and with a fresh wind the sea breaks violently upon its whole extent. The broken water in the race depends generally upon the speed and the hour of the tide, and it some times extends to a great distance in an East direction from the light house. The sea is necessarily much more agitated at the springs, and is worst with north-east gales ; but at the neaps, the streams losing much of their strength, the race is much quieter. At slack water, and with a moderate breeze, the extension of the race is only a strong rippling, and the most agitated part of it is not more than 2 or 3 cables wide. The fishermen, under these circumstances, cross it, passing through the Breche du Raz. The Barfleur pilots also take small vessels through it at this time ; and to do this they only carry the neces sary sail to steer well, so as to avoid the broken water and to keep the vessel's head to the sea. * This chateau stands S. \u00a3 W. one mile from Barfleur church, and being of a brown colour it contrasts much with the trees surrounding it."], [51, "CHAP.

Its circuit, without taking into account the shores of the mouth of the river Seine and of the Grand Vay, is about 96 miles, and it is about 24 miles deep towards the mouth of the river Orne.* This bay is open to all winds between N.W., round northerly, and N.E., and a heavy sea is thrown into it when they blow with any strength. At the springs the streams, noticed at the end of this chapter, run at the rate of 3 or -t knots, and all the harbours within its circuit become com pletely dry even before low water ; during the neaps there is little water in any of them, and they are, consequently, not then accessible to vessels of large draught. From these causes a vessel would be in a dangerous posi tion if embayed here during strong northerly winds. All the indentations of the shores of the bay, which lie out of the fair line of the tidal streams, are blocked up with sand, and the accumulations brought into them by the rivers. The principal headlands and harbours are well lighted, and thus distinctly marked during the night ; but, unfortunately, these useful guides, as well as the characteristics of the coast by day, are frequently obscured by the haze and fogs, which at times are very embarrassing. fort de easflevb is situated S. by W. H miles from Cape Barfleur lighthouse, and its position is clearly pointed out by the church built upon the northern point of the entrance. The port, which is only 3 cables long and 2 cables broad and dries at low water springs, is sheltered by the land from South, round westerly, to N.N.E., and is protected from the sea during strong easterly winds by the Antiquaires rocks, lying in front of the entrance. * See Admiralty chart, North Coast of France, Sheet XI, Barfleur to Cape d' Antifer, No. 2,613; scale, m=half an inch."], [53, "CHAP. II.] BAIE DE LA SEINE. PORT DE BARFLEUR. 37 A small jetty of stonework runs off 160 feet in a S.S.W. direction from the northern point of the entrance, and, although it narrows the entrance, yet it forms a shelter ; and there is a stone quay originally built for vessels to lie against in the harbour, but it is now in a state of dila pidation. The bottom in the port is generally good for vessels taking the ground, being composed of mud mixed with broken shells, sand, and gravel, but there are some rocky patches upon which it would be dan gerous to place them. The best berths and the most commodious are near the entrance, where the bottom is soft and the tide rises higher than elsewhere, but vessels using them must moor securely to the large iron rings fixed in the rocks, as they will be exposed to easterly winds, and sea, at springs, when the Antiquaires are covered. Vessels loading or unloading lie alongside the north quay where the bottom is 4 feet above the lowest tides ; the bottom over the rest of the port is from 4 to 10 feet above the same level. Alongside the north quay there are 16 to 17 feet at high water ordinary springs, 18 to 20 feet at great springs, and 9 to 10 feet at neaps ; thus vessels of less than 9 feet draught can enter the harbour at high water with any tide. The little traffic carried on is in flax, hemp, butter, oysters, and fish. lights. \u2014 Two fixed white lights, dioptric and of the fourth order, are exhibited, one, 23 feet above high water on the southern side of the entrance to Port Barfleur, at 230 yards W.S.W. from the rocky point abreast the jetty, and the other, 43 feet above high water, S.W. by W. \\ W., 309 yards from the former; both may be seen at the distance of 8 or 9 miles, and when in one they lead to the entrance. Dangers ofif the Port.\u2014 The outer danger in approaching Port Bar fleur is a rocky shoal, named Riden des Dents, upon which there is a dangerous patch with only 9 feet water on it, lying about a mile from the shore in an E.S.E. direction from Gatteville church-tower. The Anglais rocks lie about N.E. by E. 3 cables' lengths from the jetty, and the highest head, called the Vinberge, uncovers 7 feet at low water, and has a wooden beacon on it. The Hintar rock, lying E. by S. nearly a quarter of a mile from this beacon, uncovers 5^ feet, and a large iron ring is fixed on it forthe convenience of vessels that may warp into the harbour or anchor near it in the road. \u2022directions. \u2014 Vessels rounding Cape Barfleur from the westward and bound to Port Barfleur should, after passing the swell at the outer end of Barfleur race, take care not to go to the westward of the line on which La Pernelle and Monfarville church-towers are in one, S.W.^W,,"], [54, "38 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE d'aNTIFER. [chap. II. unless they are of light draught, or the tide has risen considerably. The two harbour lights in line bearing S. W. by W. % W., will lead through the channel to the port, between the western rocks of the Antiquaires reef and the dangers bordering the shore between Cape Barfleur and the northern point of the port. The channel narrows considerably between the Hintar and the Anglais rocks, and from thence to the entrance of the port it is only 60 fathoms wide. The eastern side of the channel is marked by three beacons. The entrance to the port is only 400 feet wide between the extremity of the jetty and the beacon which is placed upon the northern extremity of the rocks at Blanche Roche point in line with the two lights. In entering or leaving the port keep nearer the jetty than the beacon. Vessels arriving before high water with off shore winds may anchor in Barfleur road, which is a small deep formed between the Plateau des Anti quaires and the Gaillarde and Anglais rocks. The best anchorage is in about 5 fathoms over good holding ground, with La Pernelle and Monfarville church-towers in line bearing S.W. W., and Crabet windmill just open to the northward of the small hillock on La Masse point, W.N.W. This anchorage ought only be used during land winds and fine weather; should vessels, however, be surprised in it by northerly or easterly winds they must moor with open hawse to the northward, the heaviest anchor being to the eastward. The scope of cable should be short, in consequence of the small extent of the anchorage, and during springs it will be necessary to shorten in as the water falls to prevent tailing on the rocks. TIDES. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in Port Barfleur at 8h. 51m. ; at the foot ofthe north quay great springs rise 18 to 20 feet ; ordinary springs 16 to 17 feet ; and ordinary neaps 9 to 10 feet. The tides are very irregular, for with prevailing south-westerly winds the water rises higher, and with wind in the opposite direction it remains lower than the general level ; and this peculiarity takes place in all the harbours along the coast of the bay of the Seine. The mean duration of the flood is 5h. 50m., and of the ebb 6h. 35m., but the duration of the flood between a neap and the following sprim-* tide exceeds 6 hours, and sometimes reaches 6^ hours, whilst between a spring and the following neap it is below the mean. The flood stream follows the direction of the shore from Cape Barfleur, and crosses the road and the channel. Its rate at its greatest strength does not exceed 3 knots, and decreases suddenly at about half flood, when an eddy sets in an opposite direction, but with rather less speed. This eddy is weak at about high water, but it increases its rate as soon as the ebb commences."], [55, "39 CHAP. II.] PORT DE BARFLEUR. POINTE DE SAIRE. pointe du iwoiTi.aa.RD bears S. by E. E. l\u00a3 miles from Barfleur church, and is but little elevated. Rocks which uncover at low water lie off the point, and rocky ground with shoal patches on it extends about a mile from the shore. The outer or eastern patch, named Basse Orientale du Moulard, has 26 feet on il, and lies E. S. 9 cables' lengths from the Moulard rock ; when upon it Crabet windmill is in one with the northern extremity of l'llet at Barfleur. Vessels should keep a mile from the coast between Barfleur and this point whilst the Moulard rock is uncovered. ie Moulard is a granite * rock, lying S.E. by E. \\ E., 1^ cables' lengths from the point to which it gives its name. It uncovers 23 feet at the lowest tides, and is a useful and necessary mark to all those who navigate along this part of the coast; for when it is covered and the sea is smooth there is water for large vessels over all the hidden dangers between Cape de Barfleur and La Hougue.

La Pernelle hill rises N.W. by W. 3 miles from the point, and having a church on its summit forms the most remarkable object upon this part of the coast. Reville battery is situated at the extremity of Saire point, and one of the lights for affording facility for entering La Hougue road at night is shown from its south-western face. Ridens des Ecraoulettes are banks composed of sand, lying about a mile from the shore a little to the northward of the line on which the church towers of La Pernelle and Reville are in one, with not less than 28 feet upon their shoalest parts; Gatteville church-tower and the Moulard rock in one, N. by W., or the tower of La Hougue fort in line with the highest house of the lazaretto on Tatihou island, lead to the eastward.

The northernmost light is placed on the south-west face of Reville battery, at the extremity of Saire point, at 36 feet above high water, and when in one with Cape Barfleur light, N. f E., it shows the eastern extent of the dangers near Tatihou island ; the second light is placed on the south extremity of La Hougue fort, at 36 feet above high water ; and the third upon the heights at Morsaline at 282 feet above high water.

The bottom in tbis harbour is composed of a mixture of sand, gravel, and a little mud, and small vessels are supported on it by their legs, and vessels of greater burthen by heaps of faggots tied together and placed in their run on each side of the keel. The bottom on the western side of the harbour dries 6 feet, and on the eastern side 4 feet, above the level of the lowest tides, and the water rises above the latter 13 to 14 feet at ordinary springs, 18 to 19 feet at great springs, and 9 to 10 feet at neaps ; hence it will be seen that this harbour is only generally accessible to vessels under 9 feet draught. The southern passage to the harbour is between the rocky ridge extending from the jetty to the south point of La Hougue fort, and Tatihou island and the rocky ledge which extends half a mile to the south-eastward of the fort de l'llet, and which terminates in two rocky groups, named the Dent and the Gavendest ; the highest head ofthe former uncovers 7 feet, and the Gavendest 6 feet at low water. The Plateau du Ouest-Drix spreads out to the southward of these rocky groups, and a shoal spot of 15 feet lies on it, at three cables to the southward of the Dent. directions.\u2014 When bound into St. Vaast harbour, the lighthouse upon the heights at Morsaline kept about a quarter ofa point open to the southward of La Hougue lighthouse, W.N.W., will lead to the southward of the shoal patch of 15 feet on the Ouest-Drix flat, and when the spire of Reville church appears to the westward of the fort de l'llet, steer for the end of the jetty. Morsaline lighthouse kept exactly in the centre of the interval between La Hougue lighthouse and the large tower in the middle of La Hougue fort will lead between the Ouest-Drix patch and the Gavendest ; but this passage should not be attempted when the sea is heavy, neither should it be used by a stranger at night. It is difficult to leave St. Vaast harbour with the wind between S.W. and S.E., as both flood and ebb run to the northward ; but small vessels at that time, guided by pilots, can leave the harbour at the moment of high water springs, passing to the northward of Tatihou island, and keeping about a cables' length from its northern shore. tides. During the whole of the flood the stream runs to the northward between the end of the jetty of St. Vaast harbour and Tatihou island, and the ebb follows the same direction until the highest part of the beach joining that island to the land is uncovered, which is the case at about half ebb. When both streams are at their greatest strength a strong eddy forms at the end of the jetty, and extends over the whole ofthe harbour and with a fresh wind from North to N.E. the sea within is much confused;"], [58, "42 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D ANTIFER. [CHAP. II. under these circumstances vessels which are placed too far from the jetty strike heavily before they float, and also before they ground on the ebb. PORT de la hougue is the name given to a good grounding place, 4 cables long and one cable wide, lying to the westward of and under the ramparts of La Hougue- fort which completely shelters it from winds and high sea from the eastward; the water, however, is generally smooth in it, except during northerly gales, or when it blows fresh from S.S.W. to S.E. The port will admit vessels ofabout 14 feet draught at high water spriugs and 9 feet at neaps, and it is the only place on the western side of the bay of the Seine, which, at the springs, can afford shelter in bad weather to vessels of moderate draught. The best grounding places in this port are comprised between the parallel of the large tower which stands in the middle of the fort, and the wooden storehouse at the foot of the glacis, north of the fort ; and they are bounded to the westward by a shallow channel whicli receives all the water flowing from the land. The bottom abreast the tower dries 7^ feet, and abreast the wooden storehouse 9| feet above the level of the lowest tides; it gradually rises towards the northern part of the harbour. Vessels should moor with 4 hawsers, their heads to the westward and sterns to the fort, and as close as possible to the rocks lying at the foot of the ramparts. The bottom is hard, being a mixture of muddy sand and gravel, and yields but little under vessels when aground upon it. Sharp vessels will be much strained unless care be taken to use their legs or bundles of faggots fastened in their run on each side ofthe keel. dangers off the PORT. \u2014 The following dangers must be avoided when approaching Port de la Hougue, especially if there be a high sea on : \u2014 Ee Manquet, a small isolated rock which uncovers 6 feet, lying S.E. by E. | E. a short half mile from La Hougue lighthouse, and from its advanced position is much in the way of vessels navigating between La Hougue and St. Vaast. \u2022Roche Joly the top of which uncovers 3 feet, lies S.W. by W. f W. 6i cables from La Hougue lighthouse, and the sea breaks on it in bad weather.

It extends to the westward as far as the line on which the spires of Reville and St. Vaast churches are seen in one, N.N.E. E., and to the eastward as far as the Ouest-Drix flat and the northern part of the Banc de la Rade; its northern limit is on the parallel of the Dent and the Gavendest rocks, and its southern boundary the small sand bank named Haut-fond de la Grande Rade, which is said to be of recent formation. The holding is good in almost every part of this road, and vessels are well sheltered in it by the land from winds between S.S.W. and N.W., which are frequent and dangerous in winter ; but the anchorage is open to winds from N.N.E. to S.S.E., which when moderate only send in a troublesome swell, but when they blow with any strength they raise a heavy sea. Vessels suspected of having contagious diseases on board are sent from all the northern ports of France to ride out their quarantine in this road, and at times there are several at anchor in it. The lazaretto is on the western side of Tatihou island. Ea Grande Rade. \u2014 In the southern part of La Hougue road there is a small deep, named the Grande Rade, about 6 cables long, in a N.E. and S.W. direction, and 2 cables broad, where ships of the line may anchor on excellent holding ground. The best position is in the centre of the deep in 9 fathoms, with the church towers of La Pernelle and St. Vaast in one, N. by W., and the Bois de la Ville midway between Quineville church tower and a guard house on the shore. Ea Petite Rade is tbe space included between the Grande Rade and the rocks off La Hougue fort, but the good holding ground in it does not extend much to the eastward of the line on which Reville light is seen touching the south-east angle ofthe fort de l'llet. Between this limit and the Grande Rade the holding ground is indifferent, being composed of sand and broken shells, and fresh easterly winds throw in a heavy sea. The pilots anchor vessels in about 4 fathoms over good holding ground in that space which has the following limits: \u2014 Quetehou church tower in line with the south point of La Hougue fort; Morsaline and La Hougue lighthouses in one, and Reville lighthouse seen a little to the eastward of the fort de l'llet.

If drawing too much water to enter the port during the neaps, they can anchor in the northern part of La Hougue road, as the holding ground there is good, and if tbe wind blows hard from the N.E. they will in some degree be sheltered from the sea by Tatihou island and the rocks to the southward of it. directions. \u2014 The entrance to La Hougue road is between the shoal spot of 15 feet water on the Ouest-Drix flat, and the northern part of the Banc de la Rade (called the Bee shoal), which lie N. i W. and S. J E. from each other, distant 9 cables' lengths. In 1833 there were from 11 to 15 feet upon the shoal spots of the Banc de la Rade, and the northern point of that bank, upon which there were 19 feet, was a cable's length to the westward of the line on which Reville church spire is seen a little open to the eastward of the tower on Tatihou island, and La Hougue lighthouse bore N.W. -1- W. From this point a bank, named Haut-Fond du Banc de la Rade, with 5 to 6 fathoms on it extended in a north-east direction as far as where Cape Barfleur and Reville lighthouses were in one, and La Hougue lighthouse bore N.W. by W. \u00a7 W. Approaching La Hougue road from the northward the mariner should take care that his vessel is not drifted to the southward of it by the flood stream, which, from the extremity of the race off Cape Barfleur to about 3 miles off Saire point, runs to the southward, following the direction of the coast, at the rate of 3 knots during springs ; close to Saire point it changes its direction suddenly to the south-west. Vessels of large draught should keep outside the several shoal patches lying off the coast, which they may do by attending to the marks already given in page 39 for leading to the eastward of them. When to the southward ofthe shoal water off Saire point, Cape Barfleur lighthouse must not be brought to the westward of Reville lighthouse in order to avoid the dangers to the eastward of Tatihou island, and having arrived at the position where the line of Cape Barfleur and Reville lighthouses in one, is crossed by the line of Morsaline and La Hougue lighthouses in one, steer W.S.W. for the Grande Rade.

The rise is from 7i to 8^ feet at the lowest neaps, but in the southern part of the harbour it is 2 or 3 feet higher, and vessels of about 9 feet draught may be placed there at that time. With fresh winds from SW. to West, the tide rises a foot or two higher than in calm weather, and strong winds from N.E. to North produce a contrary effect. The stream of flood, at springs, in the middle of La Hougue road, begins about 4f hours before the time of high water in the port, and runs towards the W.S.W. Its greatest rate is 1\\ knots, which is at about 2f hours before high water in the harbour, and its mean duration is 5h. 20m. The ebb stream commences about 25 minutes after high water in the port, and its mean duration is Th. 10m. Its direction is towards the N.E. and E.N.E., and its greatest rate, 1\\ knots, occurs about 4h. 20m. after high water. iees ST. marcouf. \u2014 These two islands, the rocks around them which uncover at low water, and the Bastin rock, lie nearly midway between Port de la Hougue and the entrance to the Grand Vay, at about 3^ miles from the coast, and occupy a space of about four-fifths of a mile long, in an E.N.E. and W.S.W. direction, and a quarter of a mile broad. The islands are but little elevated above the level of high water, but during the day the fort and especially the large bomb-proof tower upon the highest point of the eastern island may be seen at from 9 to 12 miles off. These islands are separated by a narrow channel, in which it would be dangerous to anchor in bad weather, as the tidal streams run through it with great rapidity ; but coasters having missed La Hougue road, with a strong N.W. wind and a flood tide, may anchor during the remainder of the flood in a small bight, named Mannette, on the southern shore of the western island, provided they are moored securely and steadied by a hawser to the shore, for the eddies formed by the points of that island occasion a heavy sea.

[chap. II. banc de ST. MARCOUF extends 3 miles in a N.N.W. direction from the eastern St. Marcouf island, and the soundings are of from 26 to 34 feet water between it and the southern part ofthe Banc de la Rade, which lies three-quarters of a mile nearer the land. These two banks appear to be formed of large masses of sand and broken shells, and in 1833 there were only from 10 to 15 feet upon the shoalest parts of the St. Marcouf, and from 11 to 15 upon the shoal spots of the Banc de la Rade. The tides cross them obliquely and occasion strong eddies even in calm weather, and with easterly winds or gales from the northward the sea breaks violently upon both banks from half-ebb to half- flood. St. Marcouf bank is bounded at its northern extremity by a narrow ridge of sand, running about 1| miles in an easterly direction nearly at right angles with the Banc de la Rade, and as it lies nearly across the tidal streams, the eddies produced by it, at springs, cause a high sea when it blows hard. banc du CARDONNET extends in a S.E. S. direction 6-| miles from the western St. Marcouf island, to about N. by E. 3\u00a3 miles from the eastern mill at Criqueville, and forms, at about 4 miles from the coast, an elevated barrier in front of t'ae Grand Vay ; from its south-eastern extreme, in 6 fathoms, Colleville church-tower is in one with Percee point bearing S.S.E. E.,* and the western windmill at Criqueville is in line with the buildings at Branche farm, S.S.W. W. The bank is composed of sand and broken shells, and slopes gradually towards the south, but its northern side is steep to, which causes the sea to break with great violence upon it when the wind is fresh from N.W. to N.E., or when there is much swell on, and especially during the ebb tide. The shoalest spots on the bank, from 4 to 10 feet, extend from West to S.S.E. about a mile from the island, and the sea breaks upon them with great fury with easterly gales on the ebb. Farther to the eastward, and towards the meridian of Maisy church, the depths vary from 14 to 17 feet on the bank, and gradually deepen towards its south-eastern extremity. CHANNEE between IEES ST. MARCOUF and the COAST. \u2014 This channel, which begins to the south-east on the meridian of the Criqueville windmills and terminates to the north-west at La Hougue road, is deep, having 11 fathoms at its south-eastern entrance, gradually shoaling to the north-west. It affords good anchorage, except to the W.S.W. of the St. Marcouf islands, where a rocky bottom about three-quarters of a mile wide almost crosses the channel from the shore, and also to the E.S.E. and S.E. of Quineville, where the rocky shoals of St. Floxel extend If miles from the land. View 5."], [63, "CHAV. H.] 47 BANC DE ST. MARCOUF. BANC DU CARDONNET. The dangers to be avoided at low water are, the north-west part of the Cardonnet, which forms a small bank with 10 to 14 feet water on it lying in a S.S.E. and N.N.W. direction, at three-quarters of a mile to the westward ofthe western St. Marcouf island ; the rocky shoals of St. Floxel, which lie to the south-east of Quineville church, and extend from the land as far as where La Pernelle church is seen 2\u00b0 to the eastward of La Hougue tower; and the Bavequien rocks, which uncover at low water and border the beach from the parallel of St. Marcouf church, as far as a line E.N.E. from Quineville church. The mariners of the vicinity say that a vessel well found might ride out a heavy gale from the north-eastward in this channel, when under shelter of the high parts of the Cardonnet, the St. Marcouf, and the Rade banks, which break the violence of the sea ; but this is but a precarious shelter, and should only be resorted to as a last resource, when a vessel is embayed and all means of getting out have failed of success, for the sea at that time is said to be very heavy in the channel between the banks during the flood, and a breaking sea is caused by the weather tide on the ebb. If a vessel is obliged to bring up in this channel, such an anchorage should be sought for, that in case she is unable to withstand the high sea and must run ashore, it may be on that part of the coast, which offers a chance of safety for the crew. The Magdeleine bank at the entrance of the Grand Vay should, however, be carefully avoided, as it is composed of hard sand, and a vessel running upon it would go to pieces in a few hours. directions. \u2014 The channel between the St. Marcouf and Cardonnet banks and the coast may be taken, even at low water, provided the weather be moderate, and strict attention paid to the lead.

The ebb is rather less rapid than the flood, and runs nearly in an opposite direction. At neaps both streams are feeble, except at the entrance of the Grand Vay. GRAND vay. \u2014 The shore is flat and composed for the most part of sand hills from Port de la Hougue to the entrance ofthe Grand Vay, which is an indentation ofthe coast, formed in the south-west angle ofthe bay of the Seine, about 4 miles wide, and 6 miles deep, at the bottom of which are the small tidal harbours of Carentan and Isigny. The entrance to this deep bight, lying 5 miles to the southward ofthe St. Marcouf islands, is almost entirely filled up with sand, and would probably cease to be navigable were it not for the annual freshes from the small rivers, the Taute and the Douve on its western shore, and the Vire and the Aure on its eastern shore, which form channels with just sufficient depth to admit vessels of moderate draught going up at high tides to Isigny, and even to Carentan. Formerly the tide flowed far into the interior, and the salt water spread itself over the mea dows bordering the rivers ; but to remedy this, dykes have been thrown up at the mouth of each river, with flood gates, which close with the rising tide. In 1857 there were 24 feet at high water in the Vire and the Aure at the equinoxes, and 13 feet at ordinary springs. eight. \u2014 Maisy point, the eastern point of the Grand Vay, is very low, but is defended against the heavy sea, which sometimes rolls in upon the coast, by a ledge, named Roches de Grand Camp, extending 1JL miles to the westward, and 2| miles to the eastward of the point. The fine church spire at Maisy and the village and church at Grand Camp serve to point out the entrance of the Grand Vay, and at night its position may be known by a fixed white light, catoptric and of the sixth order, exhibited at 26 feet above high water, 875 yards to the westward of Grand Camp church, and visible at the distance of 3 miles.

It extends to the northward as far as the parallel of Maisy point, its summit is barely covered at spring tides, and the greater part of its surface remains dry during the neaps. The whole space between Maisy point and this bank is occupied by shifting sands ; that named the Feraillon is the only one that does not change its surface, being covered with gravel, below which there is said to be solid rock. There is little danger in grounding upon the sands within the Grand Vay, with smooth water during the dry season in summer, for the tides then have but little strength ; but during abundant rains or equinoctial tides the ebb stream is very strong, and heaps up the sand under the vessels which lie aground, causing them to list over and upset. anchorage. \u2014 There is good anchorage off the entrance of the Grand Vay, in Capelle road, where, during southerly winds, vessels may remain until the tide has risen sufficiently to allow them to enter the narrows. The anchoring ground, about a mile in extent, is bounded towards the west by a line on which Caretan church tower is in one with the eastern houses of Grand Vay hamlet ; towards the east by the rocky bottom which terminates in the direction of the small fort in line with Maisy church spire bearing S. by W. ; and towards the north by the high land of Menil, which rises to the eastward of Port-en -Bessin, in one with Percee point ; the latter mark vvill also lead outside the rocky ledge and dangers off Grand Camp. The best position for anchoring is, with the end of Menil cliffs in line with Percee point, or a little open to the northward of it, and the small fort about a quarter of a point open to the eastward of Maisy spire. The flood runs at this anchorage S.S.W. and S.W. by S., and the stream changes about half an hour before high water. The most favourable time for entering the narrows is about ]-| hours before high water, but with a head wind it will be prudent to weigh so as to arrive at Grouin point on the eastern shore of the Grand Vay, before the commencement of the ebb. isigny, situated 6 miles from the entrance of the Grand Vay up the river Aure, which falls into the river Vire, has a small tidal harbour, a stone quay 256 feet in length, and two small unloading slips. The staple ofthe town is salt butter, of which 100,000 pots, yielding 60,000/., are exported annually ; besides tbe butter, the exports are, grain, colza oil, and [e.g.\u2014 2.] E"], [66, "50 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE DANTIFER.

This harbour fills with mud during the summer when there is but little water in the Aure, but the freshes, which are occasioned by heavy rains, clear it out periodically, driving the mud into the channels. The water rises 9^ feet at springs at the foot of the quay, and there are 2 or 3 feet more when the harbour is washed out. Vessels are lightened during the neaps on the shore at Grouin or Beuzeville before they can proceed up to the harbour. In August 1857 the river was being deepened, the piers extended, and the course ofthe Vire improved by embankments ; a sailing vessel of 200 tons burthen was lying in the harbour, and vessels of 350 tons were building on the river. Passe du Certain, lying between Maisy point and the eastern extremity ofthe Magdeleine bank, is the entrance to the channels leading up to Isigny and Carentan. The channel up to Isigny is long and so difficult to find out that the greater number of vessels bound there are obliged to stop at Grouin point, where formerly excellent shelter was afforded to small vessels in a little bight to the eastward of the point; but it is so much filled up that those only drawing 5 feet ground upon the sand to the south-east of the point, where they are forced to remain several days to await a favourable wind and tide, and in a dangerous position with a fresh breeze upon the shore.* eights. \u2014 Between Grouin point and Isigny the channel is marked out by 20 small buoys and 5 or 6 beacons, and besides these there are at Isigny 2 fixed white harbour lights, bearing N. by E.

Passe de Carentan. \u2014 The frequent changes which take place in the channel leading to Carentan render it dangerous to attempt without a pilot, for to ground upon any of the banks at the entrance ofthe Grand Vay with a strong north-easterly wind, or upon the borders of the channel within the entrance during the rainy season, when the ebb tide is rapid, would cause the loss ofthe vessel. This channel is long and winding and only practicable during springs for vessels of 7 or 8 feet draught. It follows the steep southern edge of the Magdaleine bank as far as the mouth of the Taret rivulet, where there is a good spot for vessels to take the ground upon muddy sand, open to winds from N.E. to E.S.E., but sheltered on all other points. The channel then turns to the southward, between the shore and the Ravine bank as far as Brevand at the entrance of the Taute ; this latter part of the channel dries at low water. There is also a good grounding place on an excellent bottom of mud at 1^ miles above that at Taret, and 3 cables' lengths to the southward of the Grand Vay hamlet. tides. \u2014 The flood stream at springs loses its strength when the Grand Vay banks are covered. It crosses the Magdaleine bank with some rapidity until 3^ er 4 hours' flood, and inclines towards the inner banks, which renders the entrance to the channel difficult with a head wind ; but under all cir cumstances there is nothing to prevent a vessel getting up as far as Taret. The beginning of the ebb is weak, but as soon as the banks begin to uncover its rate rapidly increases. aspect or coast. \u2014 From Maisy point the eastern point of en trance to the Grand Vay, to Percee point, the distance is about 6 miles, and the coast between trends to the E.S.E. to within a mile to the eastward of Grand Camp church ; it then suddenly rises, and a perpendicular clialk cliff commences, about 400 feet high, which may be seen 12 or 15 miles off. The land above the cliff is apparently level, without any remarkable object on it, except the church tower of St. Pierre du Mont, which stands in the midst ofa clump of tall trees.

Between the guard-house, and the chapel of St. Come, the shore is precipitous and composed of high cliffs of rock and brown clay, intersected by narrow valleys. Vessels of large draught may approach to within a mile of the coast between Percee point and Cape Manvieux without danger. To the eastward of the chapel of St. Come-de-Fresne the appearance of the coast changes, from the before mentioned brown clay cliffs, to grace fully undulating hills, covered with rich cultivation, and rising with a gentle slope behind the shore as far as the left bank of the river Orne. From St. Come de Fresne to St. Aubin point, a distance of 8 miles, the coast trends to the E.S.E., and from the latter point it trends S.E. J S., 5^ miles to the mouth of the Orne. In the vicinity of Courseulles the shore is low, and composed of sand hills, except in front of the village of St. Aubin, where it changes its direction to the south-eastward. The highest parts of the Calvados flat are joined to this part of the coast, and render the approach to it dangerous. The coast may be easily recog nized from seaward by the clumps of trees surrounding the villages, and by the church towers which surmount them. Tailleville hill, rising to the south-eastward of Courseulles, is remarkable ; and also the hill at Amfreville, which is upon the eastern bank of the Orne, and not far from the mouth of that river. In front of most of the villages along the coast there exist, between the low water rocks, small deposits of muddy sand and gravel, called Naus, or Anneaux, which afford no shelter with northerly winds, but where the inhabitants of the villages fit out large fishing-boats at the commencement of the fine season of from 8 to 10 feet draught when laden. During the winter these boats remain either at Courseulles or in the Orne. Between St. Aubin point and Lyon the shore is rather high and the other parts of it are composed of sand hills. GRAND camp is a small village built on the shore and backed by a small hill. The inhabitants are either fishermen or sailors, and the former fit out about forty boats of from 12 to 25 tons burthen, and of from 5 to 10 feet draught ; these boats are moored to buoys on a small sandy beach, and are protected from the high sea, when the wind blows upon the shore, by the Grand Camp rocks. Two of the pilots for the Grand Vay live in the village, and eight at Isigny.

PORT-EN-BESSIN. 53 POINTE de la PERCES forms the most northern promontory ofthe chalky cliffs, 400 feet high, which border the shore from about a mile to the east ward of Grand Camp to a mile to the south-east of the point. The point projects but little to the northward, and is only remarkable by the change in the direction of the coast. A flat of sand and gravel, divided into several parallel banks, extends about E.N.E. three-quarters of a mile from the point, and the eddies occa sioned by these banks, which lie directly across the tidal streams, cause a sort of race on a weather tide ; but the race is not dangerous to decked vessels. port-en-bessin. \u2014 The coast for 1\\ miles to the eastward of St. Honorine is composed of high cliffs of rock and brown clay, and intersected by narrow valleys, some of which descend down the cliffs to high-water mark at springs, although the greater part do not reach lower than half-way down. The most considerable of the valleys which do not reach the sea is that of Port-en-Bessin, lying S.E. \\ E. 1\\ miles from Percee point, and the opening to it is about 65 fathoms wide between two cliffs, from 300 to 400 feet high, of Oxford clay. The valley suddenly widens within the opening and forms a kind of circus, more than a mile in diameter, the bottom being a level plain from 15 to 20 feet above high water, and almost entirely surrounded by gently sloping hills. The shore in front of the valley is composed of a steep beach of small pebbles and shingle, and affords, when the sea is smooth, a good grounding place for fishing boats, which are hove up out of the reach of the high sea by capstans. The approach to this beach is between a break in the rocks which border the shore, and which form a sort of creek 70 fathoms wide and 2 cables long, reaching to the beach. The creek is partially filled with banks of sand and gravel, and the sea is much less violent there than upon the rocks surrounding it; it has 21 feet in it at high water ordinary springs, and 27 feet at the equinoxes. Small trading vessels, of about 150 tons burden, arrive annually at this port during the fine season, and run upon the beach at high water, with their sterns kept to the waves by anchors buried in the fine sand ofa small hollow in the creek. The fishing vessels are large and numerous, the coasting trade not inconsiderable, and in 1856 twelve British vessels arrived with coal. Works are now, 1859, in progress to extend the pier, and to widen the bed at the entrance. eights. \u2014 A fixed lahiteYight is shown at Port-en-Bessin at an elevation of 92 feet above high water.

ARROMANCHES is a pretty little fishing village used as a watering place by the inhabitants of Bayeux. It stands upon the sea-shore at the entrance of a wide valley three-quarters of a mile to the eastward of Cape Manvieux, and as it may be seen from a great distance sea ward it serves to point out the position of the Cape, which otherwise has little to distinguish it but its height and the steep cliff in which it terminates. The inhabitants of the village fit out small half-decked vessels which they shelter from the high sea by hauling them, by means of cap stans, upon a shingle beach much resembling that at Port-en-Bessin. A rocky shore, which uncovers nearly half a mile out at low water and forms a point advancing in an easterly direction from Cape Manvieux, arrests the sea during northerly winds, and diminishes the violence of the surf on the beach. PEATEAU du caevados. \u2014 This rocky flat commences a short dis tance to the eastward of Arromanches, and extends 14 miles to the east ward along the coast, as far as Lyon. The parts of the flat which uncover at low water are, the Calvados rock, from which the name of the flat is derived, the Roches de Ver, the Essarts de Langrune, and the Roches de Lyon. A tradition is maintained in the country that a forest of chestnut trees, called the forest of Hautefeuille, originally covered the rocks which dry at low water, between Bernieres and Lyon, and that its sudden destruction took piace about 300 years since. It is also said that roots of chestnut trees are found in the fissures of these rocks, and that they are so difficult to extract, and the wood so hard, that it blunts the best tools. The north-west end of the flat lies N.E. a mile from the Calvados rock, and its outer edge, which is steep-to, preserves a distance of from li to 2\u00a3 miles from the shore as far as Essarts point, (the north-east ex treme of the flat,) which lies 3 cables to the westward of the line, on which the spires of Langrune and Douvres churches are seen in one bearing S.W. by S. ; Ver lighthouse W. \u00a7 N. ; and the tower at Oyestreham, at the entrance of the river Orne, CS. Dy E. \u00a7 E. From Essarts point, which is 2\\ miles from the shore, the edge of the flat turns sharply to the southward, and approaching the coast within a mile, continues at that distance until it is lost beneath the sands which dry to the westward of the mouth of the river Orne. Essarts point is the most dangerous part of the flat, as"], [71, "CHAP. II.] 55 ARROMANCHES. PLATEAU DU CALVADOS. it has only 4 feet water upon it, and rising suddenly from the depth of 20 feet, it occasions a change in the direction of the streams, and forms a race during the springs on a weather tide. There is but little water on the other parts of the flat, and the surface of the rocks being uneven, a high sea breaks upon them when the wind blows hard from the northward. caevados rock lies 1^ miles from the shore, in a N.E. by N. direction from St. C6me-de-Fresne chapel. It is about half a mile long, in an east and west direction, and 3 cables broad, and its western part, which is the highest, uncovers 3 feet above the lowest tides.

The best position to anchor is in about 20 feet water, with Crepon church tower seen between those of Mevaisnes and Asnelles ; and the tall spire of Bernieres in line with the houses of Ver hamlet which stand nearest Ver lighthouse. The soundings deepen rather suddenly outside the Calvados flat ; but there is no good anchoring ground at a less dis tance than a mile from its western steep edge, or than 2 miles from its eastern edge. directions. \u2014 Vessels of the largest draught may approach to about a mile of the shore even at low water, between Percee point and Cape Man vieux, but it would be imprudent to stand in so near with northerly winds. Coasters keeping close in, with off-shore winds, should be aware of the gusts which proceed from the valleys. Good holding ground will be found at 2 or 3 miles off the coast, where vessels sometimes anchor to stop tide. The tides follow nearly the direction of the shore, and their greatest strength, at springs, does not exceed 3\\ knots. In approaching the Essarts point of the Calvados flat from the west ward, keep to the northward of the line on which Ver church tower is in line with the clump of trees at Epine,* bearing West a little northerly, until Langrune and Douvres church spires are in one, S.W. by S.

The light, which is dioptric and of the third order and elevated 138 feet above high water, is visible at the distance of 15 miles. The flash is preceded and followed by a short eclipse, but the light does not quite disappear within the distance of 6 miles. The lighthouse may be easily recognized in approaching it from East or West; but between the bearings of S.E., round southerly, and S.W., it is difficult to distinguish, being backed by the land. Ver light was established for the purpose of giving warning of approach to the Calvados flat, and to afford means of avoiding that danger ; but vessels with southerly winds, after passing Cape Barfleur and bound to Le Havre, try and sight this light at 9 or 12 miles distant ; from thence they steer for the lights on Cape de la Heve, which will soon appear to the eastward. By this means they avoid making the land too far to the north ward of Le Havre, which might delay their entrance into that port. PORT de coureeueees This small tidal harbour, situated nearly 2^ miles to the eastward of Ver lighthouse, is, properly speaking, only a narrow channel through which the waters of the Seulle are conducted by intercepting, by means of a dam, the ancient course of this little river. The channel is about 2 cables long and terminates in a lock, which communicates with a floating basin, intended to sluice the harbour. The entrance to the harbour is 148 feet wide, and is formed by two jetties of unequal length running parallel with each other; the western jetty is the longest. Vessels, both foreign and native, are constantly arriving, and large boats of 80 tons are employed in the herring fishery. The bottom of the channel between the jetty heads is 2 feet higher than the sill ofthe lock, and 12^ feet above the level of the lowest tides, and the sand at the foot of the jetty heads is 2 feet higher than the bottom of the channel ; thus, in ordinary weather, at high-water springs, the harbour will only admit vessels of about 9 feet draught. In 1857, works for the improvement of the harbour were progressing, and in addition to a continuation of the jetty, a large basin was in course of construction. At that date a vessel of 150 tons burthen entered the harbour. The waters of the Seulle are neither sufficiently rapid or abundant to form or maintain a deep straight channel in the sandy beach which extends out half a mile in front of the entrance, and which terminates to seaward at the Ver rocks, the Germain rock, and the Essarts de Bernieres. The channel is distinctly marked as far as 2 cables' lengths outside the jetties ; beyond that distance the water spreads out and follows a variety of direc-"], [73, "CHAP. II.] POINTE DE VER. PORT DE COURSEULLES. 57 tions. Near the harbour, the borders of the channel are marked by three black buoys, one on either side, and the third, which is the largest, is placed outside, where the channel ceases to be well defined ; these buoys are moored securely in order that vessels approaching the harbour with a head wind may use them for warping. To do this, they should contrive to get up to the outer buoy a full hour before high water, that they may have time to warp into the harbour during the remainder of the flood. The sea is smooth at the entrance with southerly winds ; and if the ebb prevents their entering, they may remain aground without danger. The sand accumulates upon the beach to the westward of the entrance, and forms banks often sufficiently high to prevent any access to the western jetty head, except by the channel itself. This disposition of the sand renders it extremely difficult, and even dangerous, to enter the harbour when the wind blows strong between West and N.N.W., for vessels will then have the wind, the heavy sea, and the flood tide on their broadsides. Winds between N.N.E. and E.N.E. cause much sea at the entrance, but at that time they may always get in at high tide, if they are of a suitable draught. EIGHT Pi. fixed white light, catoptric and of the sixth order, is exhibited all night at 30 feet above high water, from the extremity ofthe west jetty at Courseulles, and is visible in clear weather at 6 miles; but the fogs and the mist are said frequently to conceal it. directions. \u2014 The mound and the trees at Tailleville, the fine spire at Bernieres, and Ver lighthouse, are all excellent objects by which the position of Courseulles may be determined from a distance. With northerly winds a vessel should run for the harbour either between the Germain rock, which uncovers 4 feet at the lowest tides, and the Essarts de Bernieres, or between the Ver rocks and the Germain, which are separated from each other by channels, through which, with the wind on the shore, it is advisable to pass, to avoid the high sea which sometimes breaks upon these rocks. Banville church tower in one with Courseulles light, bearing S.W.b.W.fW., will lead to the entrance of the harbour between the Germain and the Essarts de Bernieres. Beny church spire in line with the small church tower at Courseulles, S. \u00a3 E., will lead between the Ver rocks and the Germain, and a small distance to the westward of the Valette rock, upon which the sea breaks ; but in running for the harbour from this side, Beny spire had better be brought in one with a little mound, upon which there is a small battery, bearing S. \u2022\u00a3 W., and it will lead a cable's length to the eastward of the Valette, and the same distance to the westward of the Marguerite rock, (which is a-wash at low water and"], [74, "58 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER.

At low tide the waters of the river thread their way through a winding channel upon an immense collection of sand, which has formed itself at the entrance, and dries 2 miles out from the shore. At ordinary springs vessels of 12 feet draught can get up to the grounding places at the entrance. The lower course of the river, its entrance, and the adjacent parts of the channel, are encumbered by banks, which change their height, shape, and position, almost every tide, and amongst which it would be im prudent to venture without a pilot, for to ground on them would almost always involve the loss of the vessel. The parts of the passage channel which change the least are those lying towards the outer border of low-water mark ; they are covered during the neaps, and are only uncovered a short time at the springs. The banks formed on this part of the shore are named by the pilots battures, and with strong northerly winds there is a high sea upon them on the flood, and breakers on the ebb. The high banks named the Oiseaux, on the western side of the entrance, are extending to the eastward, and slowly forcing the channel and its entrance in that direction ; and it was stated, in 1841, that within thirty years it had advanced nearly half a mile. PORT de CAEN is situated 9 miles from the sea, at the confluence of the rivers Orne and Odon, and its quays extend 1,057 yards along the banks of both rivers. The port fills with mud during the summer, but in the rainy season it is cleared out by the freshes. Since the opening of the canal between this port and Oyestreham, commerce has been on the in crease, and in 1856 a thousand vessels, amounting to 53,518 tons, arrived at"], [75, "CHAP. 11.] EMBOUCHURE DE L ORNE ; CAEN. \u2014 OYESTREHAM. 59 Caen, of which 790 vessels and 39,160 tons were French, and 167 vessels and 9,661 tons were British. The cargoes of the latter are generally coal, with a few exceptions of cement, railway material, manure, and even wheat. In 1856 the population was 50,000, and the total value of imports was about 4,900/. The exports consist entirely of Caen stone, at an average freight of eight shillings per ton to London. All the cattle and butter, which were before exported, are now taken to Paris by rail. The produce of Caen and its locality is colza oil, cattle, stone, lace, and eggs. Sailing vessels of 111 feet draught may now proceed up to Caen through the Oyestreham canal. Those drawing 8 feet and steamers can still use the route up the river Orne to the quays at Caen during ordinary springs, and those of 9 feet at the equinoxes. If deeply laden, and unable to reach the quays (which, however, rarely happens now, as sailing vessels go up the canal), they are lightened at the grounding-places at the mouth of the river ; and when it blows hard from the southward they can be towed up by horses, procured a mile within the entrance, at La Roque point. The principal grounding-places are those at Merville and Siege points ; the latter is the best sheltered, but it is often invaded by sand. That at Merville point is not subject to this inconvenience, but it has only the Oiseaux bank to shelter it from northerly winds ; vessels are much disturbed here with a N.W. wind when the tide is high, and strong winds between North and East cause the anchors, which are buried in the sand, to drag. ovestreham harbour. \u2014 To remedy the numerous difficulties pre sented to navigation at the entrance of the river Orne, and its circuitous course below Caen, a fine tidal basin, with stone quays on either side, is built upon the shore at 1^ cables' lengths to the eastward of Oyestreham battery, and communicates directly, by means of a canal, with that part of the port of Caen which is upon the river Odon. The canal is especially designed for sailing vessels, and those of 11^ feet draught can proceed through it up to Caen. The basin is 320 yards long and 100 yards broad, and forms a small harbour in the midst of sand hills, having for its entrance a channel 400 yards long and 40 yards wide, enclosed between two jetties of unequal length opening into the outer part of the channel into the Orne. These jetties are built up to high-water mark at neaps, and the western jetty is 105 yards longer than the eastern. A communication is made between the basin and the canal by means of a lock, through which vessels may enter at high water. Buoys. \u2014 Three red buoys mark the western side of the channel leading to the entrance of Oyestreham harbour and the mouth of the Orne, and four black buoys the eastern side."], [76, "60 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE d'aNTIFER.

The second black buoy is placed for vessels entering the river ; there is sufficient water close to it, but when steering for the harbour pass 1\u00a3 cables' lengths to the westward of it. The third black buoy lies three-quarters of a mile from the north jetty, and is only useful for vessels entering the river ; they pass 40 fathoms to the westward of it. The fourth black buoy is moored on the west point of the Merville bank, E. by S., a quarter of a mile from the extremity of the north jetty, and vessels entering the river by the channel leading to Siege point must pass about 30 fathoms to the southward of it, and from thence steer to round the point. Pilots. \u2014 There are sixteen pilots at Oyestreham, and the same number within the river at Salleneltes, and it is said that they will meet a vessel, even during northerly gales, at a quarter of a mile out from the har bour's mouth. eights. \u2014 Two fixed ivhite lights are exhibited on the western side ofthe entrance to the river Orne, bearing N.E.

The southern or upper light, dioptric and of the fifth order, is shown from a window on the northern face of the church tower at Oyestreham, at 92 feet above high water, and may be seen at the distance of 10 miles. The northern or lower light, catoptric and of the sixth order, is hoisted every evening on a mast erected on the sand hills near the shore at a short distance to the westward of Ovestreham battery; it is elevated 39 feet above high water, and visible at 4 miles. A small red tidal light of 2 miles range is also exhibited at 66 feet from the extremity of the north end of the western jetty now extending at Oyestreham harbour. It is lighted at 3 hours before and extinguished at 3 hours after high water.

When they are moderate the sea is not heavy upon the shelves, and by crossing them at half or three-quarters of an hour before high water, a vessel will have time to arrive at the grounding-places, if intending to enter the river, before the ebb begins ; but with strong winds from those quarters"], [77, "CHAP. II.] EMBOUCHURE DE l'oRNE. 61 the pilots cross the shelves at high water. Winds from West to S.W. are also favourable for entering the river. AVith the wind from the latter quarter it will be necessary to work up, and there will be sufficient room for a good reach in the channel, but the shelves should be crossed a full hour before high water. A vessel should not attempt to enter with winds between S.S.W., round southerly, and East, if they blow strong, but if moderate, short tacks may be made in the channel, and if surprised by the ebb, she must run out immediately for fear of grounding, which is always dangerous. To enter the principal channel leading to the entrance of the river, leave the red buoys to starboard and the black buoys to port, keeping Oyestreham church tower midway between the battery and the mast of the lower light, bearing about S.W. ;* but as the mast is not easily distin guished, the tower must be kept the entire breadth of the battery open to the westward of that battery. Pass the outer red buoy about a quarter of a cable's length, and the middle red buoy about half a cable, leaving them to starboard, and the inner red buoy, if entering the harbour, 30 fathoms to port; but if entering the river, the inner buoy must be left 40 fathoms to starboard. The western part of the shifting sands com mence a short distance above the Certain beacon, which stands near the shore at about 3 cables to the eastward of the battery, and no vessel should venture amongst them without a pilot. At Night, keep the low light about 1\u00b0 open to the eastward of the high light. The two lights in line bearing S.W.

With strong westerly winds for several successive clays, the water falls but little, and rises above the highest point just mentioned; and the contrary effects are produced by easterly winds. The bottom of the channels between the shifting banks, as far as the grounding-places at Merville and Siege points, is nearly in a level with tbat of the channel abreast the beacon, and vessels of 12 feet draught may arrive up to them during ordinary springs, and of 13 and 14 feet draught at the great spring tides in the rainy season. * View 9."], [78, "62 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE d'aNTIFER. sCHAP.

The eastern limit of the road is on the meridian of Oyestreham battery, and it extends to the northward as far as the line on which Bernieres church spire is in one with the houses standing on St. Aubin point, and its southern limit is the same church spire in one with the small church tower at St. Aubin. The pilots usually place large vessels between these limits in about 6 fathoms water, with Luc church tower open half a point to the southward of the church spire at Beny, for in this position they can weigh and stand off-shore if the wind should veer round and blow strong from the northward. EMBOUCHURE de la dives. \u2014 The entrance to this river lies about E. by S. 5 miles from the mouth of the Orne, and the intermediate coast is composed of sand hills, several of which are sufficiently high to be recognized at the distance of 5 or 6 miles. A sandy beach, about half a mile wide at low water, borders the coast. This river can only be entered during the day, and when there is no swell it will admit vessels of 11 or 12 feet draught at the springs in summer, and those of 7 feet at tbe neaps ; but when there is much fresh water in the river, and when its channel and the berths are washed out, or during the equinoctial tides, vessels of even 15 feet draught may enter with a smooth sea. At all tides vessels lie upon the grounding places at the entrance ofthe river, and are well sheltered by Cabourg point. They are safe, although in an uncomfortable position, for the bottom being stiff they cannot stand upright. Those that only remain one tide are placed on the left bank of the river, and those that take in or discharge cargo alongside a small quay, or near the steep bank of the Mauvais-Pas, at the foot of a hillock, called Balise de Dives, at the entrance. The waters of the Dives run out upon a sandy beach, which at low-water springs dries a mile from the entrance. They form two channels, the deepest of which trends N. by E. \\ E. half a mile from the entrance ; it then inclines more to the north-east, and continues in that direction as far as the outer edge of the beach, which is abrupt, and causes a heavy sea at the entrance of the channel with strong winds between North and West on the flood, and breakers as soon as the ebb stream begins to gain strength. It is through this channel that the pilots conduct coasting vessels, and a red buoy marks the position where it changes its direction."], [79, "63 CHAP. II.] RADE DE CAEN. EMBOUCHURE DE LA DIVES. Two wooden beacons mark the channel near the entrance of the river ; that to the southward is placed upon its western edge at the foot of Cabourg point, and the other stands about a cable farther to the northward on its eastern edge, in front of the houses in Beauzeval valley. The second channel joins the first abreast this latter beacon, and runs to the north-west, but as it is subject to frequent changes, it can only be made use of by the mariners of the place. The space separating it from the principal channel is occupied by banks of shifting sand, which uncover at half-ebb, and upon which it would be dangerous to ground at any time. The beacons are seldom moved, but the buoy is shifted whenever the course of the channel has undergone any decided alteration. directions. \u2014 The most favourable winds for entering the river Dives are those from the northward, but it is necessary to await the moment of high water whatever the vessel's draught. During the springs, how ever, and with a smooth sea, small vessels may venture in at one hour after high water, if there is wind enough for them to run over the tide. With off-shore winds, the entrance should only be attempted by small vessels, and in turning to windward provision must be made for the heavy gusts which come down from the high land through the openings of the valleys. The pilots have no boats sufficiently large or safe to board vessels outside the entrance in bad weather. If a vessel, therefore, of suitable draught should be compelled to enter the river with a strong northerly wind, she must contrive to arrive at the hour of high water at a position about 1-| miles from the shore on the meridian of the Balise de Dives. From thence a S.S.W. 1 W. course will lead about half a cable to the eastward of the red buoy, and when abreast it steer for the space which separates the two beacons, where a pilot will be met with to conduct to the grounding place. anchorage. \u2014 Good anchorage will be found off the entrance to the Dives, at 1-g-or 2 miles from the shore, where a vessel may remain until there is sufficient water in the channel. With a turning wind into the river, it will be necessary to anchor in order to retain a favourable position; for the flood stream is here considerably increased by the proximity to the river Seine, and a vessel remaining under sail might be drifted to leeward. However good the holding ground may be along this coast, no vessel should remain at anchor longer than the weather continues fine, and the wind blows offshore ; should it come from seaward, and there should be no certainty of entering the river at high water, it will be necessary to weigh without delay and seek refuge either at Le Havre or Honfleur."], [80, "64 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER. [CHAP. II. tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at the entrance of the river Dives at 9h. 39m., and in the shoalest part of the channel abreast the eastern beacon, (where the bottom is 8 feet above the level of the lowest tides,) the water rises about the same as in the river Orne, 16 to 17 feet at ordinary springs, 18 to 19 feet at the equinoxes, and 7 to 8 feet at neaps. embouchure de la seine. \u2014 The low coast from the river Orne, composed of sand hills, terminates upon the left bank of the river Dives. and the land suddenly rises upon its opposite bank. Beuzeval hill, which commands the entrance to the Dives, and Cape de la Heve, which bears N.E. distant 13| miles from the hill, form the most western of the high lands between which the estuary ofthe Seine is comprised ; and an imaginary line drawn through Beuzeval point and Cape de la Heve may be considered the boundary between the sea and river navigation. In fact this line is nearly the extreme western limit of the accumulation of sand and mud brought down by the waters of the Seine, which has formed dangerous shoals across the mouth of that river, and no vessel of large draught should pass to the eastward of this limit, nor should smaller vessels, except during high tides, and when bound to Le Havre, Honfleur, or Rouen. It is also at this limit that the flood stream, which runs into the river, begins to acquire its strength. The Amfard and Ratier banks divide the mouth of the Seine into three channels of about equal breadth, which at low water have no issue towards the east, and abut on the uncovered and shifting sands within the river. In these channels the streams run 7 and 8 knots at the springs, and 4 and 5 knots at the neaps, and vessels of large draught should avoid approaching them during the flood, for they would be rapidly carried amongst the sands, and of a certainty lost if they should have the misfortune to ground on them. Neither can they be brought up by anchoring, for the anchors will not hold in the shifting sand, and it will be impossible to resist the violence of the stream, which increases its velocity in advancing to the eastward. The inner part of the estuary is encumbered with an immense mass of shifting sand, which dries when the sea retires, and through which the tidal streams and the waters of the river have forced a channel, the position of which is so changeable that the interval of a few days only is sufficient to transport it from one bank of the river to the other. Vessels will be exposed to great danger if they attempt this channel without the assistance of the pilots from Quilleb\u0153uf who are especially appointed to conduct both sailing and steam vessels above Le Havre and Honfleur. It is the duty of these pilots to watch the changes that may take place in the position of the banks, and to mark the actual"], [81, "65 CHAP. II.] EMBOUCHURE DE LA SEINE. direction of the channel by beacons. Their principal stations are at Le Havre and at Honfleur, and they are always in sufficient number at these places to satisfy the wants of vessels requiring them. Vessels also destined for the interior of the Seine can procure at either of these places steam-tugs to take them speedily past the dangerous parts of the lower Seine, and they will then avoid all the inconveniences which may result from a change of wind. The bed of the river being inclined, it checks the flood stream for some time at the commencement of the rising tide, but as soon as the accu mulation of water permits this stream to overcome the obstacles opposed to its course, it precipitates itself into the channels between the banks, and loses little of its rapidity until these banks are entirely covered ; it is then that the river becomes navigable. The ebb stream in summer has rather less speed than the flood, but it runs longer; during the rainy season and at the melting of the snow it has in general more strength than the flood. The channel of the Seine undergoes such frequent and extraordinary changes that a description of it would be entirely useless to mariners. We will therefore only give some general extracts which are copied from the \" Remarks on the Navigation of the Seine,\" by Mons. Bailly, Marine Surveyor : \u2014 \" The Seine is subject to the phenomenon of the Mascaret, or Bore, which by the mariners of the place is called the flot. It takes place as soon as the tide begins to rise, and may be known by a sort of roller, which extends from one bank of the river to the other, and advances with greater or less rapidity according to the range of the tide. It is always accom panied by a loud noise, which announces its approach, and is followed by the undulations occasioned by the reflux of the waters of the river. At Quilleb\u0153uf it attains its greatest strength, but it extends far beyond, and is sometimes to be found above Rouen. The greater number of accidents that happen to vessels navigating the Seine may be attributed to this Bore ; for should a vessel from any cause take the ground, it frequently happens, especially during the springs, that when the flood reaches her she is thrown on her broadside and buried in the sand set in motion by the strength of the stream, and as it is then impossible to send any assistance, she becomes, in almost every case, a lost vessel. The number of masts sticking up in various parts of the river testify that these misfortunes are not unfrequent, and the greatest attention should therefore be paid by commanders of vessels ascending the river until they arrive at Quilleb\u0153uf, where they can be secured to the quay before their vessels are exposed to the danger of grounding in tbe channel [E.C.\u2014 -2.] F"], [82, "66 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE DANTIFER. [chap. ii. If they cannot arrive at this position before the end of the flood they must hasten to take shelter either at Honfleur or Le Havre, whilst there is yet sufficient water in the narrow channels. Generally speaking, they should not attempt to ascend or descend the river without leading winds or in tow of a steamer. Sailing vessels at Le Havre or Honfleur intending to ascend the Seine should leave those ports directly they float, and with a leading wind they may expect to reach Quilleb\u0153uf before the ebb begins to be felt. This navigation, however, can only be undertaken with safety during the springs, for at the neaps the depth of water is not sufficient for vessels of much draught to navigate the lower part of the river. Most vessels waiting at Le Havre for the springs to ascend the river, quit the harbour on the ebb preceding the flood which is to take them up to Quilleb\u0153uf, and anchor in the Petite Rade ; by doing so they avoid the loss of time which the getting out of the harbour would occasion with westerly winds, and do not run the risk of losing a favourable tide.\" banc de seine. \u2014 The deposits of sand and mud washed down by the river Seine extend beyond the shoals at the river's mouth, and form an extensive submarine slope, agreeing in shape with the bank bordering the shore from Port-en-Bessin to the meridian of the Dives. This slope, upon which the soundings increase slowly and regularly towards the offing in a direction perpendicular to the coast, occupies the whole breadth of the mouth of the river, and terminates to the northward on the parallel of Cape de la Heve ; but on the parallel of Le Havre, and projecting 15^- miles to the westward of that town, lies a narrow shoal named Banc de Seine, which is steep-to on its southern side, and slopes gradually to the northward. This bank is not dangerous, having 7 to 9 fathoms on it, but the streams cross it obliquely and cause eddies upon its steep edge, where the sea is high during northerly gales on a weather tide. The Seine bank and the deep to the southward of it, called by the pilots the Parfond, may be useful in establishing the position of a vessel during fogs or falls of snow, when the navigation can only be carried on by means of the lead. From the western extremity of the bank, in 9 fathoms, the lighthouses on Cape de la Heve bear E.by S. } S. distant 14 miles, and Ver lighthouse W. by S. f S. 13 miles. The principal banks obstructing the mouth of the Seine are, the Trouville, the Ratier, the Amfard, the Hauts de la Rade, and the Eclat, the higher parts of which uncover at low water ; but as the two latter lie near the northern shore, and out of the track vessels should follow when bound for the ports in the interior of the Seine, the description of"], [83, "67 CHAP. II.] EMBOUCHURE DE LA SEINE ; BANC DE TROUVILLE. them will be reserved until the right bank of the mouth of the river is given, briefly noticing that in 1855 it was found that the Hauts de la Rade and the Eclat had not experienced any sensible alteration since 1834, but that the modifications in the banks to the southward and to the eastward of them were considerable. banc de trouvieee. \u2014 This bank of muddy sand, which is also called the B\u0153ufs, is the westernmost of all the shifting banks at the mouth ofthe Seine. In 1834 its outer limits, upon which there were only 10^ feet water, were, the parallel of the Falaise des Fonds or Fonds cliff to the north, the parallel of Trouville church to the south, and from its western extreme Cape de la Heve lighthouses were in one, bearing N.E. IN. Only a small portion of its surface was then awash at low water, but in 1855 it had increased in extent, and risen about 4 feet above the lowest tides, and the part then awash joined the Ratelets, and extended 3 miles to the S.W. by W. -| W. from it. The sea is exceedingly heavy upon this bank, with winds between W.S.W., round westerly, and N.N.E. The Trouville is separated from the shore by a narrow channel, the entrance to which is on the parallel of Trouville church. It is possible to enter the Seine by this channel, which in 1855 carried from 13 to 16 feet water over clayey mud; and, vessels can anchor in it in 13 feet abreast the mouth of the Touques, during an unfavourable tide. The streams follow the direction of the channel, and during calm weather the flood at the springs runs about 5-J hours, and ends 15 or 20 minutes after high water at Le Havre ; its greatest speed is about 4 knots towards half flood. The ebb is rather weaker, and follows in an opposite direction. banc du ratier, lying abreast Villerville at lj miles from the shore, is united at its western side to the Ratelets, and they form one of the most dangerous shoals at the mouth of the Seine. The bank is of an irregular shape, and its surface, which dries from 1 to 13 feet above the lowest tides, is covered with a large quantity of stones and rolled shingle, but its base is a mass of compact brown clay, and consequently not subject to change. That part of its surface which uncovers is a little more than 2 miles long in an east and west direction, and forms a shelter from the flood to the banks of shifting sand lying to the eastward of it. From its western extremity, which terminates in a point, Cape de la Heve lighthouses bear N. by E. -^ E. 5\\ miles. The Ratier covers towards half flood, and in 1855 it was found that the shoal connecting it to the Trouville bank had risen 2 feet above the lowest tides, and that an enormous mass of gravel had joined its northern side. f 2"], [84, "68 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D'ANTIFER.

The ruins ofthe chateau de Lasse in one with the middle of a group of houses standing at the foot of the sloping land at Trouville, bearing S. by W. | VV., leads close to the western edge of the Ratier ; and the end of the north jetty at Le Havre, in line with the middle of the valley at St. Adresse, bearing North, leads close to the eastern edge.* The sea runs high upon this bank with strong winds between West and North, but with the latter wind it shelters in some degree the channel to the southward of it.f banc d'AMFARD lies about 2 miles to the northward of the Ratier, and like the latter bank its base is formed of a mass of brown clay, its surface is covered with large shingle, and it shelters the banks of shifting sand lying to the eastward. This bank uncovers about 6 feet at low water springs, but its surface is subject to great changes, for in 1855 it was found that the stones or pebbles which constituted its inferior part in 1834 were then buried under shingle 6 feet thick, proving that the shingle on it is not so stationary as it seems to be on the Ratier. Small vessels may pass to the westward of this bank at low water, by keeping the church spire at Harfleur open a quarter of a point to the westward of the guard-house on Neiges point. The passage between the Amfard and the shore to the eastward of Le Havre, is one ofthe entrances to the great channel ofthe Seine. EEFT BANK ofthe EMBOUCHURE de la SEINE From the entrance ofthe river Dives, to the hill of Notre-Dame-de-Grace, which commands the town and harbour of Honfleur, the left bank of the estuary of the Seine trends about 15 miles to the E. by N., and the coast is bordered by high hills, terminating abruptly towards the sea in cliffs of brown clay and stone, and by large land slips, except in front of three vallies where the shore is low and sandy. The widest and most remarkable of these vallies is that through which the little river Touques finds its way into the sea. This valley is 2 miles wide at the sea shore, but narrows suddenly at the distance of 2 cables inland ; it may be recognized from a great distance off by the village of Trouville, which is built at the foot of a high steep hill at the entrance of the river. Vessels of more than 9 feet draught should be cautious when approach ing the coast at 1\\ miles to the westward of the Touques, as a flat, with only from 3 to 10 feet water on it, extends \\\\ miles from the shore.

This point runs out three quarters of a mile in a N.W. by N. direction from Villerville village, and is dangerous to vessels running through the channel, (noticed in page 67,) between the Trouville bank ancl the shore, but it will be avoided when passing to the northward of it, by keeping La Roque point bearing E. by S. S., and seen open ing and shutting in with Fonds cliff. La Roque point, is formed ofa high white cliff, perpendicular towards the river side, and may be easily recognized, being the first point on the left bank of the Seine, which is seen to open out from Fonds cliff when coming from the south west. EMBOUCHURE de la TOUQUES. \u2014 The entrance to this river lies E. by N. 8 miles from that of the Dives, and is formed in a small indentation, made by the low point of Cahote, at the north-western extremity of Trou ville village. A sand bank extends from this point, and the highest parts of it, which are scarcely covered during the neaps, tend to divert the waters of the river, and caused them in 1838 to turn abruptly to the south-west in their outward course; but in 1855 the bank had altered its position, and the waters flowed out to the north-west from Cahote point, through a narrow channel about 4^ cables long. In dry weather the wind drives a great quantity of sand into the channel, and into the river ; but the freshes, which are abundant during the rainy season, wash the sand outwards, and improve the entrance. The river in 183S could only admit vessels of about 9 feet draught at ordinary springs ; but since that period the entrance channel has much deepened, and in August 1857 the depth was 19^ feet at high-water springs between the jetties, and 14 feet at the quay, where vessels load and unload. During the neaps, those of from 11 to 12 feet draught can enter the river, and those of 8 feet can reach the quay. The breadth of the passage between the two jetties is 164 fathoms, and a red buoy, to be left to starboard in entering, is moored N.N.W. a cable's length from the western jetty, and a black buoy, to be left to port, is placed at the entrance. Vessels of from 100 to 200 tons burthen arrive almost daily, laden with coal from England. Steam-vessels can enter the river; but those of any length, although drawing little water, should not attempt it, as the channel is very narrow, and the turning sharp at Cahote point. Trouville, within the mouth of the river, is especially a fishing port, but it is occasionally frequented by coasting vessels, which find good shelter in it, and lie afloat abreast the village. The small town Touques is situated up the river at about 2 miles above Trouville, and in 1857 vessels of"], [86, "70 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE d'aNTIFER. [chai*.

The upper or inner light is stationary, and is exhibited throughout the night at an elevation of 33 feet above high water. The lower is a tide light, and its position is changed whenever the entrance to the channel has under gone any visible alteration ; its elevation is 20 feet above high water, and it is only shown as long as there are 7 feet water in the channel at the end of the Cahote bank. Both lights are catoptric, and of the sixth order, and may be seen in clear weather at the distance of 6 miles. directions. \u2014 The most favourable winds for entering the channel leading into the river Touques, are those from the westward ; but vessels should not enter before half an hour before high water. With a leading wind, they may enter within half an hour after high water, as the ebb is easily stemmed. The two lights in line will lead to the entrance of the channel, where in all weather there is almost a certainty of procuring pilots. A heavy sea runs in the outer part of the channel when it blows hard from the westward. Small vessels may anchor with off shore winds, in about 10 feet at low water, at about 1^ miles from the beach, abreast the plain of Villers, which is situated 3 miles to the south-west ofthe river, and remain there until the tide has risen sufficiently high for them to enter ; but with the wind from the N.W. they should anchor in the channel between the Trouville bank and the coast, (noticed in page 67,) with the ruins of the chateau de Lasse in one with the houses standing upon Cahote point bearing S. by W. W. ; if the wind should then freshen and change to the West or SAV., they will be able to run through the channel and take refuge at Honfleur. port de honfeeur. \u2014 From the mouth of the Touques, the steep coast trends 3 miles to the E.N.E. as far as a small village at some eleva tion, named Villerville ; it then bends more to the eastward for 4 miles to the hill of Notre-Dame-de-Grace, which is one of the highest and the most conspicuous hill in the estuary of the Seine. The only part of this coast where the shore is low and accessible at high water is between Villerville and Vasoui. This port occupies the entrance of a beautiful valley, open to the north-east, situated immediately to the eastward of the hill of Notre-Dame-"], [87, "chap, n.] EMBOUCHURE DE LA SEINE; PORT DE HONFLEUR. 71 de-Grace. It is sheltered by the land on all sides, and the wind never raises a sea sufficiently heavy to render it dangerous to enter. It possesses facili ties for heaving vessels down, spacious building yards, in the proximity of forests which furnish sufficient timber annually for the construction of 25 to 30 vessels of the aggregate tonnage of from 6 to 8,000 tons, not including those of smaller burthen. In 1855 the total number and tonnage of sailing vessels that entered the port were 1,583 and 82,918 tons ; and of passage steamers from Le Havre, 575 and 34,779 tons. According to the census taken the same year the population ofthe town was 9,0)6. The port consists of a large outer tidal harbour ; three floating basins, named the old, the new, and a third basin with a reservoir of water for scouring them out ; also a small tidal harbour on the western side, which was the first maritime establishment at the place, and now serves chiefly for steam-boats and sailing vessels employed in the daily transport of passengers and the productions of the country to Le Havre. The depth in the old basin is 18^ feet at high water great springs, 15| feet at ordinary springs, and nearly 10 feet at neaps ; in the new basin, 22^ feet at great springs, 19ifeet at ordinary springs, and 13f feet at neaps; and in the third basin, 23| feet at great springs, 21^ feet at ordinary springs, and 15^ at neaps. The greater part of the vessels that require to stop a tide previous to their going up the Seine, enter the port, where they are supplied with pilots or steam-tugs. The entrance of the port is formed between two stone jetties, 230 feet apart, and is open to the N. by E. The water running out of the port has cut a narrow and winding channel through a bank of shifting sand, which uncovers at low-water springs as far out as 2 cables from the end of the jetties. The direction of this channel being subject to change, is marked within 3 cables of the jetties by three red and three Hack buoys, the positions of which are shifted whenever it has under gone any marked alteration. The red buoys are placed on the west side of the channel, and must be left to starboard, and the black buoys on the east side, and must be left to port in entering. The channel outside the buoys takes a sharp turn to the eastward, which is caused by the violence of the flood stream driving the western extremity of the western edge of the beach in that direction. Vessels, however, at high-water springs, may almost always pass over the small banks which form a bar to the buoyed channel ; but it would be dangerous to enter without a pilot, for the sand is so moveable and the streams, which set obliquely across the channel, so rapid, that a laden vessel grounding during a high tide would run the risk of being totally lost."], [88, "72 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE DANTIFER. [chap. ii. The banks at the bar are subject to change, and are almost always a foot or two above the level of the entrance channel. They vary according to the state ofthe banks outside, but of late years they have not undergone any sensible alteration. The port, therefore, will only admit vessels of about 15 feet draught at high water ordinary springs, of IS feet at the equinoxes, when they are favoured by a westerly wind, and of 11-| feet at the utmost during the neaps. eights. \u2014 The position of Honfleur is marked at night by two fixed lights, one of which is red. The western light, dioptric and of the third order, is shown from the new light-tower erected upon a small jetty in front of the hospital at the north-west extremity of the town ; it is elevated 82 feet above high water, and visible at 15 miles. The eastern light, dioptric and of the fourth order, is red, and is exhibited at 29 feet above high water from a small tower at the head of the east jetty ; this light is only shown when there are 65 feet water in the entrance channel, and is visible at 6 miles. fatouvieee eigkthouse, 105 feet in height, stands on the high lands of Fatouville, at 3|- miles to tbe S.E. by E. of Honfleur, \u2022and ex hibits, at 420 feet above high water, a ivhite light, varied every three minutes by a red flash, preceded and followed by a short eclipse; the light is dioptric and of the first order, and is visible in clear weather from a distance of 20 miles. directions. \u2014 Port Honfleur is accessible to vessels of large draught during the springs, but those of this description, which may arrive at the mouth of the Seine before these tides, must wait under sail, if the wind is between W.S.W., round westerly, and N.N.E., for water to enter the passages leading to Honfleur, or at anchor in the Grande Rade off Le Havre if the wind is off the land ; but if with easterly winds they have only to remain a day or two for sufficient water, they may anchor in 5 or 6 fathoms, over mud mixed with sand, with the two lighthouses on Cape de la Heve in one, bearing N.E. \\ N., and Fatouville lighthouse seen half a point to the northward ofthe western lighthouse al Honfleur. At this anchorage, called the Rade de la Carosse, the stream runs towards the Seine until 4 hours flood, and its greatest strength, which takes place at 3 hours before high water at Le Havre, does not exceed 4 knots. Vessels that have only a few hours to wait for tide, should keep under sail to the westward of the line of the two lighthouses on Cape de la Heve in one, and a little to the northward ofthe line of the western lighthouse at Honfleur in one with the lighthouse at Fatouville, bearing S.E. by E. t E. ;"], [89, "73 chap.ii.] EMBOUCHURE DE LA SEINE; PASSES DE HONFLEUR. but should the strength of the tide drift them towards the river, they must anchor before passing these limits. Passes de Honfleur. \u2014 Two narrow passages lead to Port Honfleur. The northern passage lies between the Amfard and the Ratier banks, and is considered the general channel into the Seine; but in 1855 the depth in it was found not to be so great as in 1834. It is used by the pilots when the wind is between W.N.W., round north, and N.N.E. ; but with contrary winds, although there is room to work, large vessels are towed by steam-tugs. The western lighthouse at Flonfleur in line with Fatouville lighthouse, bearing S.E. by E. \u00a3 E., will lead through the passage and up to a position where a sight of the beacons at the entrance of the port may be obtained; but as a vessel must cross the banks of shifting sand, which dry at low water, and whose height is very variable, it would be extremely imprudent and dangerous to take her through, if she is of great draught, without a pilot, unless at 'nearly high water and with a smooth sea. Small coasters may proceed through it at 3-j or 4 hours flood during the springs, and at half an hour before high water at the neaps. The southern passage to Honfleur lies between the Ratier and the Trouville banks, and its direction is pointed out by the north extreme of Fonds cliff in one with La Roque point, (remarkable by its grey tint and by the perpendicular steep shore at its termination), bearing E. b. S. S. In running through, these marks must be kept on until abreast Va soui; from thence to Honfleur keep between 2 and 3 cables from the shore. This passage is generally taken with the wind between S.S.E., round southerly, and W.N.W., and coasters may run through it at 2\\ hours, and large vessels at 3-|* hours flood ; but with a leading wind during the springs, it should not be entered by vessels of large draught until 4 hours flood, as that stream runs with great rapidity in the direction of the passage between Villerville and Honfleur. The flood at the springs commences 5 hours before high water at Le Havre, and runs 5\\ hours ; ils greatest velocity, which is towards half flood, is sometimes 7 knots between Vasoui and Honfleur. Should a vessel arrive abreast Vasoui long before high water, she should sheer a little towards the shore, where the tide has less strength, and anchor until nearly high water. With strong southerly winds, precaution should be taken against the heavy gusts which rush down the narrow vallies between Penne de Pic and Honfleur, for vessels are sometimes dismasted by their violence. Small vessels when bound to Honfleur from the south-west may use the narrow channel, noticed in page 67, between the Trouville bank and the"], [90, "74 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE D' ANTIFER. [chap. u. coast, but in doing so they must proceed with caution 'by the lead, and give a good berth to the rocky ledge off Villerville. Entering* Port de Honfleur. \u2014 The most favourable winds for entering this port are those between W.S.WT., round westerly, and E.N.E. The entrance channel is crossed obliquely by the flood and ebb streams, and their velocity at full and change is from 5 to 6 knots. The flood continues 5\u00a3 hours and ends at the moment of high water, and it is at this interval of 15 or 20 minutes slack tide that a pilot will take a vessel of large draught in, for there is then little difficulty in following the course of the channel. As much sail as possible should be carried, except with a fresh fair wind, in passing through the outer part ofthe channel, and in all cases the anchor must be ready to let go should a sudden shift of wind or the heave of the sea force her out of the channel. In the event of such an accident a signal should immediately be made for the assistance ofa steam-tug by hanging the colours under the bowsprit. If the entrance is missed, anchor immediately and await the commencement of the ebb to quit the river as speedily as possible. When arriving off the port with a fresh southerly wind it will be necessary to guard against the sudden gusts which are felt under the hill of Notre-Dame-de-Grace, and those which come down the valley at Hon fleur. With a head-wind, or a calm, the assistance of a steam-tug should be obtained, as all the danger a vessel might incur in the river or at the entrance of the port will then be avoided. When nearing the entrance channel the tow-rope must be well shortened in, and great attention paid to follow directly in the wake of the tow-boat, for the smallest deviation in the steerage is sufficient to cause the vessel to ground upon the steep sides of the channel. During fogs and falls of snow a gong is sounded from the extremity of the eastern jetty when there is sufficient water in the channel. tides and tidae signaes. \u2014 In Port Honfleur it is high water, full and change, at 9h. 29m. The bottom of the entrance channel and the deepest parts of the port are nearly on a level with the lower sill of the flood-gates of the new basin, that is to say, 6 feet above the level of the lowest tides. When uninfluenced by the wind the tide rises above the lower sill, 19 feet at ordinary springs, 21 feet at the equinoxes, and 13 feet at the neaps. Westerly winds of any duration serve to raise the water, and easterly winds have a contrary effect. During rainy weather and at the melting of the snow the freshes of the Seine are abundant, and when a strong westerly wind obstructs their course"], [91, "CHAP, ii.] 75 EMBOUCHURE DE LA SEINE ; PORT DE HARFLEUR. they contribute greatly to raise the water in the port. At high water the tide remains slack only 15 or 20 minutes, but the change in the height being not more than three or four inches, from half an hour before to half an hour after high water, the gates of the basin can remain open at that period without inconvenience. In October 1857 the new system of signals, noticed in page 3, was adopted at this port. right bank of tbe EMBOUCHURE de la SEINE The extensive chalky level forming the plain of Caux, the mean height of which is about 375 feet above the level of high water, bounds the northern shore of the estuary of the Seine. Between the meridian of Quilleb\u0153uf and the valley of Harfleur the right bank of the river is steep, and presents, for a large portion of its extent, high perpendicular cliffs of chalk intersected by deep vallies, and at the entrance of the widest of them is Port Harfleur. PORT de harfeeur dries out every tide, and small vessels ground in it upon the slopes of mud forming the steep banks of the little river Lizarde. This river empties itself into the Seine at rather more than a mile below Harfleur, at the head of a bay, 2\u00a3 miles wide, between Hoc point and the hill at Orcher. The lower course of the river was cleared out in 1838, and its waters formed a channel through the sands as far out as Hoc point; but in 1855 this channel was completely choked up. POINTE du HOC. \u2014 This low point, composed of a mass of rolled shingle, lies about 1 \\ miles to the S.W. by S. of Harfleur, and 3\\ miles to the east ward of Le Havre. It may be recognized during the day by two large houses which were built to serve as a lazaretto, the light-house, and by a guard house standing about a cable's length from the lighthouse. The point forms a considerable projection from the shore, and occasions a strong eddy during the flood. This eddy stirs up the sand and hollows out a deep spot, the extent and depth of which are variable, but in which small vessels bound for Harfleur, or intending to ascend the Seine, lie aground without danger, and sheltered by the point await the spring-tides. The bottom at this spot is sand and shingle, ancl vessels are moored securely as near as possible to either of its sides. The eddy on the flood is troublesome, and the ebb rapid. Since the shingle which encumbered the shore near Le Havre has been made use of for ballast, very little drifts to Hoc point, and it no longer advances to the eastward as formerly, but widens out and spreads to the"], [92, "76 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE DANTIFER.

Neiges bank, which in 1838 rose from 6 to 19 feet above the lowest tides, and extended l\u00a3 miles from east to west abreast Nieges point, now no longer exists, but in its former position there were found, in 1855, depths of from 13 to 19 feet water. EIGHT A fixed white light, dioptric and of the fourth order, is exhibited at 39 feet above high water from the lighthouse on Hoc point, and is visible at 10 miles. anchorage to wait the tide, will be found at a cable's length from the shore to the south-west of Hoc point, with the steeple of Harfleur church seen between the two warehouses of the lazaretto ; but it is not safe for vessels to go there before 3 hours' flood, nor after 3 hours' ebb. anse de i'heure. \u2014 Between Hoc point and Le Havre the shore and the adjacent land are low, but they are defended against the invasion of the sea by a high natural bank of shingle extending to the westward as far as the middle of Heure bay, and to which an artificial embankment has been joined, abutting the wall which encloses the southern part of Le Havre. This bay seems to have been hollowed out by the violent eddy caused by the north jetty at Le Havre during the flood, and is now entirely filled up with shingle cemented together with mud, which uncovers from 9 to 13 feet at the lowest tides. In bad weather, whatever may be the direc tion of the wind, the waves break right on to the shore during the flood, and any vessel at that time missing the entrance of Le Havre, and driven into the bay, would be totally lost. EE havre. \u2014 The town, tidal harbour, and floating basins of this port occupy the south-west part of a low plain, which is an alluvial deposit formed at the foot of the mountain ridge bounding the communes or parishes of Ingouville and Graville on the north, and extending east and west from the valley near Harfleur to St. Andresse. In 1850 the foreign and coasting trade employed 9,002 vessels, measuring 1,126,358 tons, and 73,248 seamen ; of this number 7,123 were French vessels, including 5,820 employed in the coasting and river trade. The commerce increasing annually, in 1856 the foreign and coasting trade employed 13,266 vessels measuring 2,101,629 tons, and 119,583 seamen; of this number upwards of 8,000 were French vessels in the coasting and river trade. The imports consist of cotton, sugar, coffee, rice, spices, hides, iron, copper, timber, tin, tea, lead, indigo, dyewoods, tobacco, &c. &c. The prin-"], [93, "CHAP. II.] EMBOUCHURE DE LA SEINE ; LE HAVRE, 77 cipal exports are silks, broadcloths, cotton goods, lace, gloves, shoes, millinery, wines, brandy, perfumery, glass, furniture, books, clocks, watches, &c. &c. The duties received at the custom-house in 1856 amounted to fifty millions of francs. The population of the town in 1857 was 72,000. The entrance to the tidal harbour, or Avant-Port, lies S. by E. E. 2\\ miles from Cape de la Heve, and is open to the heavy sea which rolls in with strong westerly winds. The entrance channel is formed between two jetties, the longest of which, that on the north side, shelters the entrance from W.N.W. winds. The south jetty is short, and joins the wall which encloses La Floride basin. The harbour is accessible at high water to vessels drawing from 18 to 20 feet during five or six days at the springs ; that is to say, a day or two before full and change, and three or four days after. The harbour does not dry out at low-water springs, there being always at least 3 feet in the channel. The bank outside the south jetty is a con tinuation ofthe bank in Heure bay, and, like it, is composed of shingle cemented together by mud, and forms a hard bottom, in which the anchors take hold with great difficulty. The bottom of the entrance channel is of the same description; but in the harbour the shingle is covered with a layer of mud, which forms excellent beds for vessels to ground upon. Floating Basins. \u2014 The port of Le Havre, besides the tidal harbour, con sists of seven floating basins or docks, which communicate with each other by gates. The basins are capable of receiving large merchant vessels, and are named Bassin du Roi, Bassin de la Barre, Bassin du Commerce, Bassin Vauban, Bassin de la Floride, Bassin de l'Eure, and dock Entrepot; steam vessels of heavy tonnage go into the Floride and the Eure basins. The lock opening from the harbour into the Floride basin is 68 feet 10 inches wide. and H.M. Yacht Victoria and Albert went through it in August 1857, with two or three inches to spare. The locks leading direct from the harbour into the Eure basin are in progress of being opened to a very great width. The other locks are from 52-^ feet to 37^ feet wide, which last is the lock leading into the Vauban basin, where British colliers lie. The basins are surrounded by wide and commodious quays. The lower sills of the gates of the Roi and the Barre basins are 3^ feet above the level of the lowest springs ; the sill of the gate of the Floride basin is only six inches above that level. The gates of the Roi and the Barre basins can remain open without inconvenience until the water has fallen 2 feet"], [94, "78 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE DANTIFER. [chap. II- below high water, whicli, both at spring and neap tides, takes place about i-j* hours aster the slack of high water ; and as these gates are opened by the pressure of the rising tide, about as long before the commence ment of slack water, it follows that the basins can communicate with the harbour during 3| or 4 hours of each tide. The harbour is bordered by quays on all sides. The north quay is used by steamers that convey passengers on the Seine and to the neigh bouring ports. The steam-tugs lie alongside the Floride quay ; and all the rest ofthe harbour is used by vessels waiting for spring-tides to go up the Seine, and by coasting craft. In the Commerce basin there are two repairing slips and a masting sheers. There is also a quay for vessels to heave down to at the upper part of the harbour, close to the gate of the Barre basin, and new works are constructing at the building slips established at the Perrey, outside the fortifications of the town.

According to regulations tbe greatest distance is Cape Barfleur, and the shortest distance is outside the banks at the entrance of the har bour ; but as there is great competition among them, they are provided with excellent boats, in which they go to meet vessels as far as the Casquets. When they pilot vessels out of the harbour, they are bound to conduct them clear of the outlying banks, and if the^ consent to take them farther, they are paid 15 francs, or by special agreement. Steam-tugs are in readiness to go out of the harbour every tide ; and when their services are required, they are demanded by hanging an ensign under the bowsprit. eights. \u2014 The position of the north jetty at Le Havre is marked at night by a fixed white light, dioptric and ofthe fourth order, exhibited throughout the night from a small tower standing on the north side of the jetty, and about 36 feet from its termination ; the light, 39 feet above high water, is visible about 10 miles off. A small orange coloured fixed light, visible about a mile off, is also shown at 23 feet above high water from the end of the south jetty, to point out its position during dark nights. To complete the lighting of the entrance, a glass, coloured red, has been fixed to a lantern on the quay of the harbour, and this lantern is so placed that by keeping the red light given by it opening and shutting with the eastern edge of the Tour de Francois Premier, the"], [95, "chap, h.] EMBOUCHURE DE LA SEINE ; DANGERS OFF LE HAVRE. 79 course of the channel may be followed from its entrance nearly up to that tower. dangers off ee Havre. \u2014 The approaches to Le Havre are ob structed by banks of stones and shingle which form a belt of dangers front ing the shore between Neiges point and Cape de la Heve. The highest parts of this belt are the banks named Banc de l'Eclat, Hauts de la Rade, ancl Haut de la Petite Rade; and in the survey of 1855 it was found that they had not experienced any sensible alteration since 1834 ; the summit of the Eclat is, however, a little raised. The shoalest spots are marked by different coloured buoys ; a chequered black and red buoy is moored off the south-west part of the banks, and no vessel should pass within it without a pilot.* Banc de l'Eclat is divided into two high ridges lying a quarter ofa mile apart. The depth is 6 feet on the northern ridge, but the summit of the southern ridge is awash at low-water, and is one of the most dan gerous spots in the neighbourhood of Le Havre. This shoal patch, which lies with the lighthouses on Cape de la Heve bearing N.E. by E. ]| miles, and the lighthouse on the north jetty S.E. \\ E. 2^ miies, is stationary, and its surface is covered with masses of flint and shingle. In the cut or depression of the Eclat bank there are only 6 or 7 feet at low water. There is a passage at the south-west end of the bank with about 16 feet in it, but it is too dangerous to be taken without a pilot. A red buoy, with ball on top, in 16 feet water, marks the north part of the bank; a red buoy, without ball, in 13 feet, the south-east part ; and a black buoy, in 15 feet, the south-west part. Hauts de la Rade commence at about a quarter of a mile to the S. by E. of the Eclat, and extend as far as Neiges point. They are com posed of three ridges separated from each other by narrow channels with from 10 to 12 feet water in them. The north-west ridge is about 6 cables long and a cable broad, and has only 4 feet water on its highest part, which lies S. by E. 6 cables from the highest part of the Eclat. The western ridge lies half a mile to the southward of this dangerous spot, and has onty 5 feet on its northern end ; it is the outermost danger on the parallel of the entrance to Le Havre, ancl is marked by a black buoy lying W'est a little northerly 3-Jr cables from the 5 feet depth, with the lighthouses on Cape de la Heve in one, bearing N.E. \\ N., and the chateau d'Orcher in line with the projecting angle of the wall enclosing La Floride, E. by S. * See Admiralty Plan ofthe Mouth ofthe Seine, No. 2,680 ; scale m = U inches."], [96, "80 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE DANTIFER. [chap. II. The third ridge joins the shore, and its highest part, which just un covers at the lowest tides, lies with the lighthouses on the Cape bearing N. by E.

Haut de la Petite Rade, a heap of stones and shingle about a cable in diameter, is the only danger that exists in the Petite rade. It lies N.W. by W. half a mile from the north jetty, and has only 3J feet water on it. petite rade du HAVRE lies in the space bounded by the banks just described, and the coast between Le Havre and Cape de la Heve. lt is well sheltered from N.E., round easterly, to S.E., but is open to all other winds ; and those between North and W.S.W. send in a heavy sea when they blow strong. The holding ground is good, and the anchors take such firm hold of the clay that there is sometimes great difficulty in weighing, especiallj' when vessels lying here have been exposed to strong westerly winds. It should, however, only be considered as a temporary anchorage, to which vessels may resort with off-shore winds to wait for sufficient water to enter the harbour, but they ought not to remain there in unsettled weather, or when it blows strong from the westward. Anchorage Vessels of moderate draught anchor in the middle ofthe Petite rade in a deep spot, with from 16 to 25 feet water in it, 5 or 6 cables long in a N.W. and S.E. direction and 2 cables broad, from the centre of whicli the two lighthouses on Cape de la Heve are in one, and Fatouville light-house is open about a quarter of a point to the north ward of the light-tower on the north jetty. Unfortunately this good anchorage is too limited, and the depth too little in it to risk large vessels stopping there any length of time. Small vessels are placed nearer the shore on the line of Fatouville lighthouse open a little to the northward of the light-tower on the jetty, but no nearer the shore than to have the southern lighthouse on the Cape bearing North. The holding ground is so good here that a small vessel well moored, and with a sufficient scope of cable out, would be in no danger during a westerly gale, without she parted. DIRECTIONS.\u2014 The only practicable entrance channel into the Petite rade du Havre, that can be made use of by vessels of moderate draught at low water, is between the cliffs of Cape de la Heve and the"], [97, "chap, h.] EMBOUCHURE DE LA SEINE; PETITE RADE DU HAVRE. 81 northern ridge of the Eclat, but a stranger should not use it without a pilot. The least depth in it in 1857 was from 12 to 15 feet at low water, midway between the northern ridge and the shore. To enter this channel steer for the southern lighthouse on the Cape on an E.S.E. bearing, and it will lead about 2 cables to the northward of the red buoy placed near the shoal spot on the northern ridge of the Eclat ; when about 3 cables distance from the cliffs the vessel will be in mid-channel, and must then bear away to the southward for the red buoy moored between ihe northern ridge and the shore, taking care not to approach so near the land as to entirely lose sight of the lantern of the northern lighthouse. Small craft, locally acquainted, may run for the anchorage in the road at low water, passing through the channel, either to the northward or to the southward of the southern ridge of tbe Eclat ; but the lead and the chart must be their guide. tides. \u2014 The flood stream begins in the Petite rade at about 11 hours after the tide has begun to rise in the harbour, or at about 4 hours before high water there. Its first direction is S. by E. for 2 hours, with a velocity of from 1\\ to 3 knots; it then turns to the E.S.E. and the stream is imperceptible until high water in the harbour, when it again acquires its strength ancl runs to the N.N.W. and ends in that direction \\\\ hours after. The ebb commences immediately and runs N.N.W. for 3 hours or until 4-i- hours after high water in the harbour ; it then turns to the W.S.W. and ends in a S.W. direction a few minutes before the flood commences. At the northern entrance into the road the streams follow the same course, but the flood does not end until 2 hours alter high water. The ebb runs to the N.N.W7. during 2^ or 3 hours, and then turns W.S.W. and S.S.W. When ihe tide is out in ihe harbour the ebb runs S.S.W. at the rate of from 1^ to 2 knots, and it ends in this direc tion a little before the flood stream commences at this spot, or about 4 hours before high water in the harbour. Vessels running into this road at low water should be aware of this stream of tide when passing the shoal patches. grande rade du Havre lies about N.W. by W. 5 miles from Cape de la Heve, and is simply an anchorage in the open sea, exposed to the violence of both winds and waves from N.E., round northerly, to W.S.W. Vessels of large draught, having to wait for the springs to enter Le Havre, may sometimes anchor in it when the wind is between E.N.E., round easterly, and S.S.W., but they should be prepared to weigh instantly, upon any change in the weather. The holding ground is excellent, and a vessel at [E.C.\u2014 2.] a"], [98, "82 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE DANTIFER. [chap.

When near these banks, the directions must be attended to for entering the harbour given in page 86. With a fair wind, weigh so as to be at the harbour's mouth at the proper time for entering. tides The flood stream begins to be felt in the Grande rade at about 4 hours before the time of high water at Le Havre. An hour after, it runs to the S. by W, at the rate ofabout 3 knots, and continues to run towards the Seine until 2^ hours before high water ; its direction is then E.S.E., losing little of its strength, and then E.N.E. In the latter direction its rate increases to 1\\ or 3 knots at the time it is high water in the harbour ; it then decreases in strength, and the stream ends about 2 hours after, running to the N.E. by N. The ehb commences almost as soon as the flood ends, the slack water lasting only about a quarter of an hour at the springs. This stream turns round by the west, and about 3 hours after high waier its direction is N.W., but it does not attain its greatest strength, which is 1\\ knots, until it runs W.S.W., or about 5 hours after high water ; it then slackens gradually as it turns to the southward, where it ends. DIRECTIONS for approaching EE HAVRE from tbe WESTWARD. \u2014 Generally speaking it is the direction of the wind which is met with at the entrance of the Channel that should determine the choice of the mariner, as to the landfall he should make in order to take a fresh departure for the remainder of the voyage to Le Havre. With the wind between E.N.E., round northerly, and W.S.W., the English coast should be made between the Lizard and Portland Bill, but not to the eastward of the Bill, for, should it veer to the S.W. it would then be impossible for a sailing vessel to reach Le Havre if the flood stream is running. As soon as the position of the vessel is well ascertained a direct course should be shaped to sight the lighthouse on Cape Barfleur. With the wind between W.S.W., round southerly, and S.S.E., the points of the French coast which should be sought for in succession are, the isle of Ouessant ; the high land between that island and Bas isle ; the island of Guernsey, the sight of which will assist in making the Casquets ; and lastly, the island of Alderney, and the high land crowning Cape de la Hague. Great attention, however, must be paid to the tidal streams when"], [99, "CHAP. II.] 83 LE HAVRE ; DIRECTIONS. running between Bas isle and Guernsey, the directions of which must be crossed nearly at right angles. During the ebb there is no danger, as it runs towards the N.N.W., but on the flood it will be necessary to allow forthe effect, of that stream which is rapid at the springs. At 10 miles from the coast, between Ouessant and Bas isle, the flood stream ends at about 21 hours after high water on the shore. In the channel between Guernsey and the Casquets the rate of the flood is from 4 to 5 knots at springs; its influence must, therefore, be avoided, and a vessel should at all times manage to pass to the westward of the Casquets, and, if possible, only just within sight of them. In the channel between Alderney and Cape de la Hague, as well as at 5 miles to the northward of that Cape, the flood stream ends at 4 hours after high water on the shore, and its greatest speed, which is from 6 to 7 knots, takes place at the time of high water. The ebb stream ends at 3^ hours flood on the shore, and its greatest rate, which takes place at low water, is about equal to that of the flood. As the direction of this latter stream is towards the W.S.W., and tends to draw vessels into the Race of Alderney, as well as between Alderney and the Casquets, it will be necessary to be extremely attentive to its effects, according to tbe hour of the tide and the distance the vessel may be from the shore. From the meridian of Cape de la Hague the course will be about E.S.E. to make the lighthouse on Cape Barfleur, taking care to keep from 3 to 6 miles from the coast in order to avoid the numerous dangers which border it. When the lighthouse at Cape Barfleur, or the high land at La Pernelle are made out, a course should be shaped, if the wind is between North and West, to make the land between Cape de la Heve and Cape Antifer, or if it is between West and South for the former Cape. After passing Cape Barfleur, and having entered the bay of the Seine, the first land that will be seen when steering for Le Havre is that which bounds the estuary of the Seine on either side. The high land of the plain of Caux will be ahead and to the northward, terminating towards the coast in chalky cliffs of dazzling whiteness, which, when lighted up by the sun, permit their outline to be distinguished from 18 to 20 miles off; and the land to the southward will be the hills bordering the left bank of the Seine from Honfleur to the river Dives, and their rounded shape, and especially their dark colour, will serve to distinguish them from those to the northward. When the meridian of Cape Barfleur is crossed towards the commence ment of the flood, that is, about 5\\ or 6 hours before high water at Le Havre, (see table, page 35), a vessel with a leading wind may arrive off Le Havre G 2"], [100, "84 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE DANTIFER. [chap. II. in time to get into the harbour should the tide serve. On quitting the meridian of Barfleur at the commencement of the ebb, or about one hour after high water at Le Havre, a course should be shaped for Cape Antifer, and only sufficient sail carried to stem the tide which will be found running, in the middle of the bay, 3-J* or 4 knots at springs, at about 4^ hours after high water at Le Havre. Should the position of Le Havre be made out before the commencement of the flood, it may be taken advantage of as soon as its influence is felt, but the sail must be regulated so as not to arrive offthe harbour's mouth until there is sufficient water to run in with. At night, with the wind between North and West, a course should be shaped from Cape Barfleur to make the land between Cape de la Heve and Cape Antifer. The lights on Cape de la Heve and the light at Fecamp will be good guides to point out the vessel's position, and to prevent her approaching too near the land, if it is borne in mind that Fecamp light is concealed by the high land at Etretat on an E. -L N. bearing, and the lights on Cape de la Heve by the hillocks at Bleville when they are in a S.W. J S. direction; so that if Fecamp light is concealed before those on the Cape the land will be made to the southward of Cape Antifer, and if the lights on the Cape are hidden before the light at Fecamp it will be necessary to haul quickly to the southward. The light at Fecamp will not be lost sight of at the distance of 6 or 7 cables off Cape Antifer, nor the lights on the Cape when at the same dis tance off the coast between Cape Antifer and Cauville. Thus, should it be desirous of maintaining a position during the night by turning to wind ward between Cape Antifer and Cauville, go about, when standing in for the land, as soon as the lights on the Cape disappear, and in standing off shore during the flood, tack when Fecamp light reappears; but during the ebb the board may be continued farther without inconvenience. With a moderate breeze and a smooth sea a vessel may anchor on the line of direction where Fecamp light is eclipsed by the land, provided she is some miles to the southward of the parallel of Cape Antifer. The holding ground is excellent as far as 5 miles off shore between that Cape and the Grande rade, but near the coast between the guard-house of Bleville and Cauville the bottom is covered with heaps of large stones to the distance of 1-1 miles from the shore. It may be proper here to remark, that between Capes la Heve and Antifer the flood stream runs to the N.E., at 4 or 5 miles from the shore, for 4 hours ; that is, from 2 hours before to 2 hours after high water at Le Havre, at the rate of 2 or 3 knots at springs, and when it slackens il turns to the northward, so that a vessel caught by a contrary wind when south of Cape Antifer, would be unable during that period to reach Le Havre by turning to windward close in shore"], [101, "85 CHAr. II.] LE HAVRE; DIRECTIONS. but she may reach the Grande rade by keeping at least 4 miles from the coast. During the freshes of the Seine it is necessary to avoid getting to the northward of the parallel of Cape de la Heve when intending to enter Le Havre. When rounding Cape Barfleur with a southerly wind, from a position about 6 miles to the northward of the Cape, steer S.E. by S. or S.E. to sight Ver lighthouse, and when on the meridian of the lighthouse keep away two or three points to sight the lighthouses on Cape de la Heve. Le Havre should then be steered for if the tides serve, but the sail musi; be regulated so as not to arrive off the harbour's mouth until there is sufficient water to enter ; if not, steer for the anchorage in the Grande rade. With a head wind, long boards should be made across the bay of the Seine by day as well as by night, recollecting that the flood stream ends in the bay nearly 2^ hours before high water at Le Havre. APPROACHING EE HAVRE from tbe EASTWARD, with the wind between North and East, the channel between the Ridge bank or Le Colbart and the French coast should be taken, and from thence a S.W. by W. course will lead between the Bassurelle and Vergoyer banks, direct for Cape Antifer; Fecamp light will be seen in following this course, and will be a good guide at night. This channel is also used in fine weather when the wind is between South and East, keeping 4 or 5 miles from Cape Gris-Nez, and passing outside the Bassure de Baas bank. When to the southward of the river Somme, and to the westward of the meri dian of Dieppe, the coast may be neared if necessary; but should the wind veer to the south-west a vessel should quit it immediately, and if it increases to a gale, a sheltered anchorage will be found to the east ward of Dungeness. With the wind between N.N.W., round westerly, ancl W.S.W., the channel should be used between the Varne bank and the English coast. From Beachy Head to Cape de la Heve the course is S.S.W.i W.,and the distance 74 miles. As the passage across with westerly winds is made more advan tageously on the flood than on the ebb, vessels therefore usually wait in sight of Beachy Head lighthouse for the end of the flood, so as to arrive abreast of Cape Antifer at the beginning of the following flood, in time to enter the harbour of Le Havre if the tides serve. Fecamp light is an ex cellent guide for the landfall on the coast of France, and will be seen in clear weather soon after that at Beachy Head is lost sight of.

[chap, ii outside the banks off the entrance, until the tide has risen sufficiently to pass over them, but a stranger should not attempt to enter without a pilot. The stream runs into the Seine from the commencement of the flood until 2 hours before high water; but there is no fear of their being drawn into the river if they keep to the westward of the line of the two lighthouses on Cape de la Heve in one, bearing N.E. i- N., or if Cape Antifer is kept open a few degrees to the westward of Cape de la Heve, taking care at the same time not to go to the southward of the line on which the chateau d'Orcher, which stands near the shore at about 2 miles to the eastward of Harfleur, is seen in one with the projecting angle of the wall inclosing La Floride, bearing E. by S. With a fresh breeze between W.N.W., round northerly, and E.S.E., there will be no difficulty in turning to windward and keeping a position ; but with all other winds keep as near the line given by the chateau and the wall at La Floride in one, because at about 2 hours before high water in the har bour, when the Seine is nearly filled, the flood stream turns to the E.S.E., losing part of its strength, and then to the N.E. In the latter direction it runs with the same velocity as when it ran up the Seine, and retains it until nearly 2-j hours after high water, and should a sailing vessel at that time be near the parallel of Cape de la Heve, it would be almost impossible for her to reach the harbour in proper time to get in. With strong winds between N.N.W., round westerly, and W.S.W., it will be necessary to keep under sail 6 or 8 miles to windward ofthe harbour, until there is sufficient tide to enter; but with moderate winds between S.W., round southerly, and E.N.E., or during calm weather, or at the times of the freshes of the Seine, it will be better to anchor in Carosse road (page 72), or between that road and the line upon which the chateau d'Orcher is seen in one with the projecting angle of the wall inclosing La Floride, E. by S. Vessels can always get into the harbour from the anchorage in the Petite rade, even during calms or head winds. Those of large draught which have failed in entering, and when the direction of the wind and the late hour of the tide do not permit of a second attempt, should hasten to run out of the Seine ; but small vessels may take shelter under Hoc point (page 75), whilst the tide is high. The direction of the entrance channel into the harbour of Le Havre, being at right angles to the direction of the flood stream entering the Seine, it consequently crosses the mouth of the harbour, and renders its access difficult under certain circumstances, which are necessary to be known. The north jetty projects into the strength of the flood stream, and occasions an eddy, the strength and extent of which depend upon the"], [103, "CHAP. II,] 87 LE HAVRE; DIRECTIONS. velocity of that stream, and upon the range of the tide. At about 3 hours before high water, when the stream begins to acquire its greatest strength, which is 4 or 5 knots at the springs, the eddy extends as far as Heure bay, and forms along the shores of that bay, and also along the walls enclosing La Floride, a rapid counter stream, a part of whicli turns round the end of the south jetty to enter the harbour, whilst the other part runs sharply against the north jetty, along which it forms a disturbed eddy. This motion of the water continues till about 1^ hours before high tide in the harbour; but at this period, the Seine being nearly full can no longer receive all the water which runs towards it from all points of the estuary, the stream therefore slackens, except towards the left bank of the river, where the flood, following nearly the same direction that it would do supposing the Seine did not exist or was entirely barred off, not finding any issue upwards, crosses the Seine objiquely, and runs to the north-east : this direction, however, soon changes and becomes more northerly as the river fills. As soon as this cross stream has gone through these changes and reached Hoc point, a portion of it runs along the shore to the westward and pro duces the stream named the Verhaule, which at the entrance of Le Havre follows the same direction as the eddy on the flood, just noticed, and immediately follows it, but always with this difference, that the Verhaule passes round the jetty and runs to the north-west. It is easy therefore to imagine that the confusion caused by these different effects of the flood stream, must raise a high and violent sea at the entrance of the harbour when it blows strong from the westward. The Verhaule, a part of which enters the harbour and tends to fill it, is evidently the last portion ofthe flood; but as it runs in an opposite direc tion to that which the flood follows during the first hours of rising tide, it keeps vessels in the entrance channel, and facilitates their entrance in westerly winds. Its greatest strength is at about three-quarters of an hour before the time of high water, and continues until the harbour is filled, when it decreases gradually, and is hardly perceptible at the end of slack water. The ebb then commences, and is feeble at first, but at the expi ration of an hour it gains strength and runs towards the North and N.N.W. in the same direction as the Verhaule when near its end. The deviation of the flood stream, occasioned by each of the projecting angles of the quays bordering the entrance, is another difficulty in entering Le Havre with a scant wind, especially if a vessel has entered before the basins and the harbour are filled."], [104, "88 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE d'aNTIFER. [chap. II. From what has preceded, it will be seen that the best time to enter the port of Le Havre, for those vessels that purpose remaining in the outer harbour, is at high water slack, but this is rather too late for those intending to enter the basins. These, on the contrary, should enter as soon as the tide serves, to have time to be well secured before the beginning of the ebb. The anchors should be ready for letting go before entering, and one placed conveniently for anchoring by the stern ; the warps also and the hawsers must be coiled clear on deck, ready to be carried out in case the vessel is obliged to anchor in the entrance channel. The time of tide, however, to be chosen by a sailing vessel for entering must greatly depend upon the direction of the wind. With a fresh westerly wind she may run in even whilst the counter stream which runs along the walls of La Floride is at its greatest strength, but care must be taken to keep in mid-channel, so as not to drift on the north jetty. With fresh winds between W.S.W., round westerly, and N.N.W., the Ver/taule causes a violent sea, and it will be better then to wait till the end of slack water to enter, for the sea is then rather less confused, and the tide is slack in the entrance channel. This precaution is especially necessary when the vessel does not answer her helm quickly. Writh the wind sufficiently strong, between S.S.W., round southerly, and E.S.E., to stem the tide, she may enter before the Verhaule commences and steer on the starboard tack for the north jetty, to get hold of the hawser which the hauling crew will throw out to her, and she will then be tracked into the harbour. Should the wind, however, be between E.S.E., round easterly, and N.E. it will be advisable to wait until the Verhaule slacks, in order to steer for the north ]etiy on the port tack, when by luffing up she will reach the hawser. The sails should then be furled, and the vessel will be tracked in. Pilots with their boats are always ready at the entrance to carry the hawser on board, ancl to run out warps when necessary, except when the sea is too high and violent to prevent them. Steam-tugs are also in readiness during calms and variable winds. tides and TIDAL signaes. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in Le Havre harbour at 9h. 51m. The water let out of the basins and that which escapes from the sluices at the locks serve to keep a channel through the mud of the outer harbour, the bottom of which is about 6 inches below the level of the sills of the dock gates, and about 3 feet above the level of low-water great springs. The rise of tide in this channel is 21 to 22 feet at ordinary springs, 23 to 24 feet at the equinoxes, and 15 or 16 feet at neaps. The lowest neap observed occurred on the 5th March 1819, when the tide rose only 13 feet. There are also some examples of extraordinary"], [105, "89 CKaVP. n.] EMBOUCHURE DE LA SEINE. LE HAVRE ; DIRECTIONS. rise at neap tides, and on one occasion it rose 20^ feet above the level of the bottom of tbe harbour. When the tides are forced up by high winds from the westward the water rises upon the quays, but this but seldom occurs. The direction of the wind, and more especially its force and duration, exercise a great influence on the height ofthe tide. The freshes of the Seine, which occur during the rainy season, and the melting of the snow, also contribute greatly to raise the water in the harbour, and it has been remarked that the highest tides have almost always occurred during the strongest freshes. This harbour has this advantage over almost all the other harbours of the Channel, that the tide at high water remains slack in it during the mean interval of 57 minutes. The maximum duration has been observed to be lh. 15m., and the minimum from 20 to 25 minutes. In general, during the months of May, June, and July, the duration of the slack water is, with some exceptions, below the mean, and the rest of the year it continues almost always an hour and more. a*\\t the springs the duration of the flood is 5h. 10m., and of the ebb 7h. 15m. The new system of tidal signals (noticed in page 3) is used at Le Havre. The depths of water in the entrance channel are made from the Tour de Framjois Premier, at the entrance of the harbour, ancl from thence repeated from the telegraph station on Cape de la Heve. To prevent accidents to vessels entering the harbour, the following signals, to be made at the flag staff on the north jetty, were established on the 18th June 1858 : Red flag - - To enter the port is impossible. \u201e, , ( Sailing vessels of all kinds and small steamers are Blue pendant over * . . r,. c ..i t \u00ab.-*..\u25a0 ,'fl < not to enter.

[chap. II- From Cape de la Heve the coast trends N.E. i N., nearly in a straight line for rather more than 11 miles to Cape Antifer, and is composed of cliffs of chalk and flint, the height of which is from 320 to 370 feet, and when the wind blows upon the shore it offers no accessible spot. Between Cape de la Heve and the little valley of St. Jouin the crown only of the cliffs are perpendicular, the lower parts being banked up by enormous masses of flint which have mouldered down. It is said that the percussion of the large waves raised by the frequent winds between North and West forces these masses continually along the shore, and that they have formed the banks which obstruct the approach to Le Havre and the Seine. Beyond the valley the cliffs are quite perpendicular, the sea washing their bases, and in the afternoon, when they are lighted up by the sun, their brightness is so dazzling that they may be seen 21 miles off. eights On the summit of Cape de la Heve, and not far from the edge ofthe cliff, stand two lighthouses, each exhibiting a fixed white light, dioptric and of the first order, at 397 feet above high water, and visible 20 miles off. The lighthouses are of equal height, 66 feet high, built of freestone, and when in one bear N.E. \\ N. and S.W. \\ S. from each other, distant 69 yards apart. These lights were chiefly established to point out the position of Le Havre and its adjacent anchorages during the night; but it is said that they are often concealed by mist, and that under many circumstances are less distinctly seen than the light on the north jetty at Le Havre. The lead must, therefore, be frequently used when approaching them from the westward, especially if Ver light has not been sighted.

TIDAL STREAKS in the BAT of the SEINE The tidal wave of flood after having traversed the western portion of the Channel, is much con tracted as it advances to the eastward, between Cherbourg and the Isle of Wight, and in consequence of this compression its velocity is greatly in creased, particularly towards the French coast. As soon as it has passed the meridian of Cape Barfleur, its southern portion turns rapidly in every direc tion between South and East, to fill up the empty space occupied by the bay of the Seine ; whilst the eastern portion, or that part to the northward of a line drawn from Cape Barfleur to Cape Antifer, follows its original direction almost as far as the meridian of the river Orne, where it begins to curve to the East, and then to the E. by N. A considerable portion of the water which enters the bay, after rounding Cape Barfleur with great rapidity, forms a stream which takes a S.E. bv S. direction towards the mouth of the Seine. The southern part of this stream runs along the shore of the bay, and follows its sinuosities from"], [107, "CHAP. II.] CAPE DE LA HEVE. TIDAL STREAMS. 91 Percee point to the mouth of the Orne, and then turns towards the Seine ; the northern part turns obliquely towards the coast between Le Havre and Cape Antifer, and then bends back to the S.S.W. and S.S.E. towards the Seine. Thus the mouth of the Seine being the point towards which all these streams are directed, the river becomes full at two-thirds flood, and the water within having attained the level of that without, the streams lose their strength and are forced to the eastward, and run towards the E.N.E. and N.E. in the direction they would have naturally followed from the commencement of the tide, if the Seine had not existed, or had been completely barred up. The ebb stream, in general, when at its greatest strength, follows in the interior of the bay an opposite course to that ofthe flood; but to the northward of the line drawn from Cape Barfleur to Cape Antifer its direc tion is W. by N., whilst that of the flood is E. by N. and E.N.E. The windings of the coast modify the direction of both streams near the shore, and behind each of the projecting points there is an eddy which depends on the strength of the tide for its extent. During the springs the flood stream is more rapid than that of the ebb. It commences suddenly, and is not long in gaining strength ; the ebb, on the contrary, is slower in establishing itself. When the stream and the wind are in the same direction, the rate and the duration of the former are increased in proportion to the strength of the wind ; but when the wind blows in a direction opposed to that of the stream, it has little effect on it."], [108, "92 CAPE BARFLEUR TO CAPE d'aNTIFER.

The high cliffs of chalk and flint extend from Cape de la Heve to about 4 miles to the north-east of Treport, near the town of Ault, and beyond them commences a low coast fronted by a sandy beach, upon which three wide vallies open out and give issue to the waters of the rivers Somme, Authie, and Canche. This low coast extends to within about 4 miles of Boulogne; the land then rises abruptly, and the shore continues steep, with a few exceptions, as far as Cape Gris-Nez. All the harbours between Capes Antifer and Gris-Nez dry out at spring tides, and they are inaccessible to vessels of large draught during the neaps.* The cliffs between Cape Antifer and Ault are precipitous, their foot resting upon a narrow shelf of rock covered at all times of tide. The ports of Fecamp, St. Valery-en-Caux, Dieppe, and Treport, lying at about equal distances froni each other, are situated at the entrances of wide vallies, which form breaks in the line of cliffs. The land crowning the cliffs is for the most part level in its whole extent, but the monotonous aspect of the coast is varied by the towns and villages near the sea, and by the verdure covering the sides and the bottom of the vallies, which contrasts with the uniform white colour of the cliffs. As the openings of all the valleys are dissimilar in some points, it will be easy to recognize them from each other, even from a considerable distance, in tbe offing. The cliffs remarkable for their elevation are, that of Jagnet point, the north point of the entrance of the valley of Fecamp, upon which stands a chapel dedicated to Notre-Dame-du-Salut and Fecamp light house; the cliff of Catellier, with asmall mound on its summit, which forms the western side ofa wide valley, named Pallud, watered by the Durdent river; the cliff of St. Leger, at three-quarters ofa mile to the westward of * See Admiralty Chart, North Coast of France, Sheet XII., Trouville to Dieppe, No. 2,612; scale, m =-\u25a0\u25a0 half an inch."], [110, "94 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRIS-NEZ. [CHAP. Ill' St. Valery-en-Caux, marked by a church tower, the only remaining part of the church ; the cliff of Sotteville, rendered remarkable by a large guard house and a heavy-looking church tower overtopping a row of trees ; and the cliff at Criel, at 3| miles to the south-west of Treport, which is the highest of them all, and is surmounted by a large hillock covered with heath, called Mont Joli-Bois. When sailing close to the coast with off shore winds, precaution must be taken against the squalls which rush down the vallies ; the most violent are felt abreast the openings that do not reach to the beach. The entrances of the rivers Somme, Authie, and Canche are formed in the low land which extends over a space of 35 miles, from half a mile to the north-east of Ault to the foot of the hills, the most western parts of which form Cape Alprech, but they are now all obstructed by banks of shifting sand, which project far outside their openings and dry at low water springs. The small harbours of Wimereux and of Ambleteuse have been abandoned and can no longer admit any vessel. The coast between Cape Antifer and Ailly point, about 5 miles to the westward of Dieppe, is without danger, and large vessels may coast it at the distance of 1^- miles ; but to the eastward of this point the ap proach to the shore is dangerous for vessels of large draught, for from the meridian of Ailly point to that of Treport are banks of sand and shells, usually called Ridens, extending 1 1 miles from the shore ; and to the east ward of these is the shoal bottom which forms the basis of the banks of shifting sand obstructing the mouth ofthe Somme, and which extends even to the northward of the river Canche. Outside of these dangers, and towards the middle of the Channel, are several long submarine banks of sand, seeming to converge in a direction towards Cape Gris-Nez ; three of these join the shore between the rivers Somme and Authie, but the others are isolated. These banks lie generally E.N.E. and W.S.W., nearly in the direction of the tidal streams ; but the Ridins or ridges, point to the N.N.W. and S.S.E., in a direction perpendicular to the banks, and consequently across the streams. There are spots on most of these banks sufficiently shoal to be dangerous for large vessels at all times of tide, while some are only so at low water ; but at full and change the tidal streams form strong eddies at their steep edges, and in bad weather, or when the winds blow strong on a weather tide, small vessels crossing these eddies will subject themselves to a heavy sea. The greater part of the ridges are only to be avoided from the eddies they occasion, but shoal spots have been found on some of them, which at low water in bad weather might be dangerous to vessels of large draught."], [111, "CAPE D'ANTIFER. ETRETAT. CHAP. III.] 95 caution*.\u2014 During strong winds between W.S.W., round westerly, and N.N.W. the coast to the eastward of Ailly point is dangerous to be on, and shipwrecks are of frequent occurrence ; vessels therefore of every description at that period should keep a good offing, and when obliged to approach it, must do so with great caution ; for although the general mass of the above banks appears to be stationary, yet great attention must be paid to the lead and in observing the confused state of the sea in the various eddies, so as to guard against suddenly meeting with dangers which may be of recent formation. The lights for the purpose of pointing out the position of the headlands and dangers between Capes Antifer and Gris- Nez at night, are so disposed that in clear weather two can always be seen at a time, and the greater number of the harbours have one or more tide lights shown during the time the harbour can be entered. It is important to notice that along the coast between Cape de la Heve and the town of Ault (a space of 67 miles) the wind, when it blows in a direc tion perpendicular or nearly so to the direction ofthe coast, is reflected by the high cliffs, neutralizing in great measure its original action to a certain extent in the offing, depending upon the strength ofthe wind. It follows from this that a zone is formed off the coast and parallel to it, except in front of the wide vallies where the direct wind meets with no obstacle, where the wind is light, the sea much agitated, and the waves run towards the shore. On the contrary, when the wind forms an acute angle with the coast, the reflected wind contributes to increase the direct wind near the shore. cape -d'antifer differs little from the adjacent land, and is only re markable for the change in the direction of the coast.* The Cape is rounded, and terminates in a perpendicular chalk cliff, 320 feet high, the foot of which is washed by the sea, and in clear weather it may be seen at 18 or 20 miles off. Vessels of any draught may approach it to 2 or 3 cables' lengths without danger even at low water. From hence the coast trends about E.lN. 9 miles to Fecamp, and the shore may be approached to 4 cables' lengths. etretat, a large village inhabited by fishermen, stands upon the shore at the entrance of a wide valley open to the north-west, and the houses are built upon low land defended from the incursions of the sea by a natural dyke of shingle, upon which the fishermen haul their boats out of the reach of the surf by means of capstans ; an embankment 44 yards long serves to strengthen this dyke and to protect it in bad weather from the force of the waves.f * View i3. t View 14."], [112, "96 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRIS-NEZ. [chap. Ill The cliffs both to the eastward and westward of Etretat are very remark able. They form sharp projecting points, with openings in them resembling arches and doorways. At half a cable to the south-west of the point, to the westward of the village, is a high rock, or rather the remains of the fallen cliff, to which, from its pyramidal form, the name of Aiguille d'Etretat, or Etretat needle, is given. The eastern part of the beach at Etretat is bordered by rocks, which uncover at low water. Abreast Etretat the shoal bottom, with less than 8 fathoms on it, projects a mile to the N.N.W. from the shore, and when the flood stream is at its greatest strength it occasions a great eddy, named by the mariners of the coast the Hardiers, which extends to the eastward as far as the Vaudieu rock, and makes the sea hollow and heavy when the wind is fresh from the eastward. ipoet, a fishing village situated W.S.W. 2^- miles from the entrance to Fecamp, is built, like Etretat, at the entrance of a valley upon low land near the sea, and sheltered by a natural dyke of shingle, which is strengthened by a small stone jetty. The beach in front of the village is encumbered with rocks, which uncover at low water, and is only accessible to fishing boats. The bluff point of Chicart, and the rocks at the foot of that point, afford a little shelter to the beach against westerly winds, but it is quite open to the northward, and when the sea is high the boats are hauled upon the dyke. Between Etretat and Iport, at 11 miles from Etretat point (called also Porte Orientale or the Eastern gate), and at less than a cable's length from the cliffs, is the Guillemot rock, which resembles a ruined column, and rises 160 feet above the rocks that uncover along the shore. Halfway be tween this rock and Porte Orientale, but a little nearer the cliffs than the Guillemot, is the great Vaudieu rock, about 53 feet high. These two rocks, like the Etretat needle, seem to be the remains of ancient cliffs. The base of the Guillemot is so worn by the sea that it is probable that it may fall ere long. pecam?, a commercial, fishing, and refitting port, is situated at the entrance ofa fine valley watered by the rivers Valmont and Ganzeville. It consists ofa small bar tidal harbour, and at the bottom of the harbour is a basin, which will admit vessels of 12 or 13 feet draught at high water ordinary springs, and in which they may at all times lie afloat.* The entrance channel to the harbour is open to the N.W. by W., and runs between two stone jetties, 181 feet apart, at the foot of the high cliff forming Fagnct point. Wnen there is no shingle at the entrance, the bottom ofthe channel, which is of hard white porous stone, dries 3 feet above the * View 15."], [113, "CHAP. III.] IPORT. FECAMP. 97 lowest tides. The south jetty is only 172 feet long, and was built at the end of the natural dyke, which shelters the harbour, to arrest the pro gress of the shingle along the coast from the south-west, and to oblige it to take a direction outwards from the entrance. The north jetty, 326 feet long, is built upon the rocks, which uncover at the foot of Fagnet point, and forms a continuation of the quay on the northern side of the harbour. Bar. \u2014 A beach three-quarters of a cable wide uncovers at low water in front of the entrance to Fecamp harbour, and the shingle, which is driven continually along the shore from the south-west, forms a bar between the jetties, the height of which is variable, and depends upon the strength and duration of westerly winds. In a medium state it is about 3 feet above the bottom of the entrance channel, or 6 feet above the level of the lowest tides. During westerly gales a large quantity of shingle drifts into the entrance; the bar then rises and the channel fills, but by employing the scouring sluices for several successive days at the springs, it is rendered navigable, and the shingle at the bar is driven away. The back water at Fecamp is very powerful for scouring out the channel, and it is calculated that the reservoir at ordinary springs discharges 590,000 cubic yards by a sluice, the lower sill of which is 14 feet above the bottom of the channel. This sluice also maintains a narrow channel in the deepest part of the harbour leading up to the lock gates of the floating basin. The fall of the scouring water has hollowed out at the foot of the sluice a small pool, the bottom of which is 12 feet below the foot of the gate of the floating basin, and is sufficiently large to contain a vessel of from 12 to 13 feet draught. The Belle Angelique corvette remained some time in it in 1805. Tbe Harbour is about 2 cables long from north to south and a cable wide, and dries out at low water. A high and strong natural dyke of shingle cemented with mud closes it on its west side, and shelters it from the attacks of ihe sea, and its other sides are bordered by quays. With a fresh wind from the westward a heavy sea runs into the entrance channel, and reaches the interior of the harbour, and the surf it occasions is dis tressing to vessels moored along* tlie eastern quay, and sometimes causes damage. The bottom of the harbour for the most part is stiff, being composed of a mixture of chalky mud, gravel, and a large quantity* of shingle. The bottom alongside the quays is indifferent, and the only advantage to he gained by placing a vessel there is, that she may remain upright upon her keel ; in the western part of the harbour it is soft, but vessels heel over very much and continue aground there during the neaps.

[chap, in- bottom at the foot of the northern quay is 4 or 5 feet above the level of the lowest tides ; and at the foot of the eastern quay, and at the western berths at the foot of the shingle dyke, it is from 6 to 8 feet above that level. The Basin, which occupies a surface of about 21,891 square yards, is constructed in the south-west angle of the reservoir for scouring out the harbour, and where all the running streams ofthe valley have been united. Two of its sides are formed by embankments of earth, but that towards the south is bordered by a quay 754 feet in length. The basin commu nicates with the outer harbour by means of a lock, 33 feet wide, the sill of which is 8^ feet above the level of the lowest tides, and it will admit vessels of 12 or 13 feet draught at ordinary springs. lights. \u2014 Fecamp lighthouse, 56 feet high, stands on the summit of Fagnet point, at about 93 yards from the edge of the cliff, and exhibits at 426 feet above high water, a fixed white light, dioptric and of the first order, visible 18 miles off; but the position it occupies, upon the crest of an abrupt hill at the edge of a deep valley covered with meadows and watered by abundant streams, causes it to be frequently obscured by the mists, or completely hidden by fogs. Fecamp harbour is pointed out at night by a fixed white light, varied by a bright flash every three minutes, which is shown, while there are more than 10 feet water in the entrance channel, from a small stone tower standing 58 yards from the extremity of the north jetty ; the light is dioptric and of the fourth order, elevated 39 feet above high water, and visible 10 miles off. A vessel approaching the harbour from the eastward will not open this light till it bears to the southward of S.W. by W., as it. is masked by the projecting part of Fagnet cliff when to the westward of that bearing. The time during which the harbour is accessible by day is made known by a large national flag hoisted at the head of a staff on the north jetty, and it is kept up as long as there are more than 10 feet in the entrance. directions. \u2014 Fecamp harbour is difficult to enter at all times, and dangerous to attempt when it blows strong from the westward, on account of the heavy sea at the entrance ; for should a vessel at that time miss the harbour and ground upon the rocks off Fagnet point, she would be totally lost. When it is impracticable, the flag or the light is not shown from the north jetty. Every assistance is given to warp or track vessels when entering or leaving the port, and when the weather permits, boats manned by the coasting pilots are ready at the entrance. Vessels arriving off the harbour towards low water, with the wind between W.S.W. and W.N.W. should steer for the land about Etretat, and keep a"], [115, "chap, in.] FECAMP. 99 position to windward ofthe harbour till the tide serves to run in. With the wind between N.N.W., round northerly, and E.N.E., the land should be made about Vattettot and Iport ; and if the wind should come off shore, and there is apprehension of losing the tide, anchorage will be found at about 1^ miles from the coast, near the meridian of Iport, in 10 fathoms water, over toler ably good holding ground, with Etretat needle in one with Porte Orientale, and the bell tower ofthe Abbaye at Fecamp in line with the last slope of the hills a little to the southward of the houses of the town. On arriving only two or three hours before high water, a vessel might anchor closer in shore, but a position should always be chosen so that she may be able to fetch the entrance of the harbour. These anchorages, however, are only good for a few hours, unless the weather is quite fine. One of the difficulties when entering Fecamp harbour is the stream of flood, which continues to be felt at the jetty heads for about half an fiour after high water in the harbour, and runs even at that time 1*| knots at a cable's length outside the heads, so that a sailing vessel approaching the entrance on the starboard tack is generally driven to leeward ofthe north jetty and misses the port. With a fair wind, or when close hauled, suffi cient sail should be carried to get quickly into the harbour, and it must be so balanced that the helm may be answered with the greatest prompti tude. With the wind from the northward violent gusts come down from the high land to the northward ofthe entrance. The method generally adopted when entering the harbour with a fair wind, is to stand for the south jetty head, and then drift towards the middle of the north jetty ; the sails may then be clewed up, and the vessel will be tracked in. If intending to enter the basin, the harbour should be entered at least three-quarters of an hour before high water ; but if the vessel is to remain in the harbour, it may be entered later. caution. \u2014 Care must be taken on quitting Fecamp harbour with a westerly wind, to avoid being drifted by the flood on the Charpentiers shoals, which join the rocks at Fagnet point, and extend to the westward as far as the line on which St. Leonard church spire is in one with the north jetty head, S.S.W. To pass well outside the swell caused by these shoals, keep Grinval valley open, so that the new guard-house may appear above the middle of the cleft by which the descent is made to the beach.* tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in Fecamp harbour at lOh. 44m. and the tide rises above the bottom of the entrance channel, abreast the middle ofthe north jetty, from 22 to 23 feet at ordinary springs, about 25 feet at great springs, and 15 or 16 feet at neaps; but these heights are * View 16. H 2"], [116, "100 CAPE d' ANTIFER TO CAPE GRIS-NEZ. [chap. in. given with the supposition that the entrance channel is cleared of all the shingle that is occasionally deposited there. When the wind blows strong from the westward for several successive days, the tide rises one or 2 feet higher in the harbour ; but there is then a heavy sea at the entrance ; the contrary is the case with the wind from the eastward. The mean duration of slack water is 15 or 20 minutes at the utmost. The coast from Fecamp trends E. by N. 10 miles to Catellier point, and then E. by S. 5 miles to St. Valery-en-caux, and is formed of high perpendicular cliffs of clialk and flint, intersected by numerous vallies, the greater part of which do not reach down to the beach. A shelf of irregular rocks, which uncover at low water, borders the shore, but those parts of it which project farthest out do not extend more than about 3 cahJes from the cliffs, so that large vessels may approach the shore to about balsa mile at any time of tide. The appearance of this part of the coast is dull and uniform, and the land seen above the cliffs is apparently level and only overtopped by the clumps of trees surrounding the farms and villages. Above these trees there occasionally appear some church towers, the most conspicuous being those of Senneville, Sassetot, St. Martin-aux-Bunaux, Conteville, and St. Leger; the latter, which stands near the edge of the cliff at three-quarters of a mile to the westward of St. Valery, is a tall isolated spire, and may be seen from a great distance in the offing. ST. VALEHY-EH-CAnx, a small bar harbour used for shelter and refit ting, is situated at the entrance ofa narrow valley enclosed between high hills, and will admit vessels ofabout 14 feet draught at high water ordinary springs when the bar is not too high ; but only fishing and small coasting craft can frequent it during the neaps. The mackerel, herring, and cod fisheries are carried on at this port, and Baltic and Norway timber, wine, brandy, &c, are imported. The port consists of a channel, formed between two jetties of unequal length, leading into a small tidal harbour, and of a reservoir for backwater, the surface of which is about 67,000 square yards, used for scouring out the harbour and the entrance. A floating basin in the form ofa parallelo gram, 328 feet long and 164 feet wide, is constructed in the south-west part of the reservoir, and communicates with the harbour by means ofa small lock with sluice gates. The lock is 29^ feet wide, and the sleepers 9^ feet above the level of the lowest tides. The valley of St. Valery, of which the town and harbour occupy the entrance, is about 2 cables wide, and situated at the bottom of a small elbow formed by the falling back of the coast. The rocky ledge which"], [117, "CHAP. III.] 101 ST. VALERY-EN-CAUX. uncovers at the foot of the cliff along the coast has an opening in it in front of the valley, and the space between is made up with a beach of chalky mud and cemented shingle 1\\ cables wide, upon which the shingle driven from the westward by the surf during high winds from that quarter is deposited. The channel leading to the harbour runs across this beach, and the jetties between which it passes take a S.E. by S. direction ; the length of the western jetty is 377 yards, including open pile work of 129 yards, and the eastern jetty 169 yards. Bar \u2014 The beach uncovers during springs a cable's length outside the western jetty, and the shingle borne from the westward forms on it a bar in front of the entrance, one end of which almost always joins the west jetty head. The scouring water not having force enough to open a passage through the bar, runs out in the direction of its eastern end. The bar rises if westerly winds continue, and a south-westerly gale brings an enormous mass of shingle upon the beach ; the higher the bar the more it extends to the north-east, and forces the outer part of the channel to the eastward. The entrance sometimes is completely closed by the shingle ; when this occurs an opening is made by manual labour, and increased by repeated scourings, but it remains a long time obstructed and difficult of access. When strong easterly winds blow for any length of time, the surf drives the shingls from the entrance, lowering the bar and dividing it into several parts, which if taken advantage of by scouring out, the channel is sometimes completely cleared, and leads in a straight direction as far as the western edge ofthe beach, passing close to the western jetty head. Harhour. \u2014 The interior of the harbour of St. Valery is surrounded by quays, and well sheltered, except against northerly winds which send a swell into it. When these winds blow strong, the surf is sometimes so great that vessels are in danger of breaking from their moorings, and it is to obviate this inconvenience that the floating basin has been made. The bottom is a mixture of mud, gravel, and sand, and as the mud is in great quantity the grounding berths are good. Vessels should be placed parallel to the quay, and the moorings must be watched as the back water is let down, for the harbour being very narrow, the scouring water spreads itself aver its surface, and its rapidity is such that it will undermine the bottom under those which have grounded either across or obliquely to its direc tion. There is a small repairing slip at the entrance of the harbour, and a crane on the western quay for masting small craft. LIGHTS. \u2014 A small brick tower stands on the rising ground at 72 yards from the extremity of the west jetty at St. Valery-en-caux, and a fixed"], [118, "102 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRIS-NEZ. [chap. in. tuhite light, catoptric and of the sixth order, is exhibited from it while there are more than 8\u00a3 feet water in the entrance channel; the light is elevated 29 feet above high water, and may be seen 6 miles off. A fixed red light is also shown from the end of the east jetty. During the day a large national flag is kept flying on a flagstaff erected in front of the light tower while the above depth is in the entrance channel. When vessels of dif ferent sizes are off the harbour waiting to go in, the flag is hoisted half mast as soon as there is water in the entrance for those of the smaller draught, and hoisted quite up when there is sufficient water for the others. directions. \u2014 Vessels unable to enter St. Valery-en-caux harbour during the neaps must keep at sea until the springs, except with off-shore winds in fine weather, when they may anchor at from half to three-quarters ofa mile from the shore, between the guardhouse at Cinq Trous and St. Leger, in 5 to 10 fathoms water, over tolerably good holding ground. If they arrive off the entrance at the springs, and have only a few hours to wait for sufficient water to enter, they should, with westerly winds, make short boards between Catellier point and St. Leger, or if the wind is from the eastward they can keep a position off the harbour. In standing in shore to the east ward of the entrance, care must be taken to keep Catellier point well open to the northward of the point formed by the cliffs near Sussette valley, bearing about W. \\ N., to avoid a dangerous bank of sand and gravel named the Ridens, lying E. by N. three-quarters of a mile from the west jetty head, upon which are only 2 feet at low water and a high sea during a weather tide. There is no difficulty in entering the harbour, whatever may be the direc tion of the wind, provided the entrance channel runs at the foot of the western jetty head, and when the wind does not admit of sailing between the jetties a vessel will be tracked in by a crew always in attendance ; but it is difficult of access when the bar joins the foot of the jetty head and the channel opens to the northward, and it would then be imprudent to attempt it, with the wind between South and West, without a pilot. When the state of the sea prevents the pilots going out, they attend on the jetties to point out by signals the course to be followed to round the bar and to enter the channel. The most favourable moment to enter with westerly winds is when ihe Sciade or eddy is at its greatest strength, that is, from half an hour before to half an hour after high water, but the anchors must be clear and sufficient sail carried for the vessel to answer her helm quickly. With winds between North and East, it is advisable to enter before the Sciade has acquired its full strength, for fear of being drifted upon the west jetty. With northerly winds there is a high sea upon the bar, and sail should be"], [119, "CHAP. III.] 103 ST. VALERY-EN-CAUX. carried in crossing it, as the wind reflected by the cliffs decreases the force of the true wind, and if the surf is not crossed rapidly a heavy sea may be shipped. There is not much difficulty in quitting the harbour, as it can only be attempted in moderate weather, but care must be taken to choose a favourable time of tide ; thus with easterly winds vessels should leave the jetty before high water, whilst the flood stream has still much strength, and with westerly winds they should not leave until the ebb stream is well established. tides. \u2014 At St. Valery-en-caux it is high water, full and change, at lOh. 46m. The bottom ofthe entrance channel, from the foot of the west jetty head to the eastern edge of the bar banks, is 16 inches above the level ofthe sleepers of the basin lock, or 11 feet above the level of the lowest tides ; and the rise of tide at this part of the channel is 17 to 18 feet at ordinary springs, 19 to 20 feet at the equinoxes, and 8 to 9 feet at the neaps; with fresh westerly winds the water is a foot higher, and with easterly winds a foot lower than the ordinary rise. During the springs, when the bar and the rocks joining the shore to the westward of the harbour begin to cover, the flood stream forms in the elbow to the eastward of the jetties a great eddy which runs along the shore of the elbow and the outer side of the eastern jetty. This eddy, named the Sciade, much resembles the Verhaule at Le Havre; a part of it, after rounding the east jetty head, enters the entrance channel, while the prin cipal portion crosses the channel obliquely, runs along the west jetty, and rounds the head of it as soon as the flood stream outside slacks, which takes place about a quarter of an hour before high water. The eddy is usually more rapid with westerly than with easterly winds, and when at its greatest strength, which is shortly after high water, it assists to keep vessels in the channel. The flood stream continues to be felt at a short distance outside the jetties for more than half an hour after high water in the harbour, and is a great hindrance when entering with westerly winds, or when the sea is high, and it becomes necessary to round the bar to the northward to get into the entrance channel. pointe de sottevilie From St. Valery-en-caux the coast, formed of a high perpendicular cliff of chalk and flint, trends about E. by S- 15 miles to Dieppe. The first projecting point to the eastward of St. Valery is that of Sottevilie, which may be known a great distance off by a heavy church tower rising above the trees ofthe village, from whence the point takes its name, and by a conspicuous guardhouse. The shelf of rock bordering the shore extends about 2 cables from this point, which"], [120, "104 CAPE DANTIFER TO CAPE GRIS-NEZ. [chap, iii- should not be approached within 3h cables by vessels hugging the coast with off-shore winds. raz de st. mickel, \u2014 From Sottevilie point the coast takes an E. J N. direction for 5 miles to Ailly point, and three wide valleys, separated by high cliffs, occupy half the interval. The middle valley, named St. Aubin, descends to the beach, and on its eastern side the waters of the river Dun open a passage across the shingle heaped upon the shore. The rocks which uncover at the foot of the cliffs extend 3 cables from the shore on both sides of this valley, and in front of it an irregular rocky bottom projects a mile from the shore, where the depth is from 14 to 20 feet water. This extension, lying at right angles with the tidal streams, causes a strong eddy, named the raz. or race of St. Michel, which is dangerous at low water to small vessels sailing near the coast with off shore winds; but Catellier cliff kept well open ofthe point formed by the cliffs near Susscttc valley bearing about W. i-N. leads outside it. points D'AILLY licht, \u2014 Ailly point is of a rounded .form, and although less elevated than man}' other points of the coast, may be easily recognised, as the perpendicular chalk cliff forms only half its height. A thick bed of clay and vegetable mould, lying on the top of the chalk, slopes down to the edge of the cliff, and a little behind it stands a tower, 66 feet high, which exhibits, at 305 feet above high water, a revolving white light, the eclipses of which take place every minute, but are not total within the distance of 10 miles. The light is dioptric and of the first order, and in clear weather may be seen 27 miles off. roches d'Al&liY. \u2014 The shore eastward and westward of Ailly point, from the valley of Pourville to that of Quiberville, is bordered by a bank composed of blocks of freestone, named the Roches d' Ailly, which uncover at low water, and terminate in a point at half a mile to the N.N.E. of the lighthouse. A rock called the Galere, higher and larger than the others, rises from the middle of the bank, and when its summit is covered there are about 20 or 21 feet water in the entrance to Dieppe. The square church tower of St. Jacques, at Dieppe,* kept on an E.S.E. bearing, leads half a cable to the northward of the bank ; the towels on this bearing will appear 2\u00b0 or 3\u00b0 open to the eastward ofthe cliff, upon which the ramparts ofthe castle are built. GRANDS and PETITS ECAMIAS and RISEN de DIEPPE It is on the meridian of Ailly point that the western part of those heaps of sand and broken shells is found, named Ridens or Ridges, (noticed in page 94,) which extend 1 1 miles in the offing, and to the eastward as far as the meridian of * View 17."], [121, "POINTE D'AILLY. PORT DE DIEPPE. CHAP. III.] 105 Treport. Those lying to the northward of Ailly point are divided into two groups, and as they have not less than 7 fathoms water over them, and from 12 to 15 fathoms around them, they can only be dangerous in bad weather ; the northern group, named Petits Ecamias, lies 7 miles, and the southern group, Grands Ecamias, 4 miles from the shore. The Ridens generally are not dangerous, but the sea runs high in the eddies formed by them on a weather tide. The Riden de Dieppe, however, which lies N.N.E. J E. 10 miles from Dieppe,* is an exception to this rule, for vessels of large draught might strike upon it at low-water springs; and small vessels are liable to ship heavy seas when crossing it in bad weather. When this part of the coast was surveyed in 1835 it was 2 miles in length, in a N.N.W. and S.S.E. direction, and the highest part was half a mile long, and had from 23 to 27 feet water on it at the lowest tides. caution.\u2014 As it is probable that these Ridens, being composed of substances easily set in motion, are liable to change their position, the mariner will act prudently when in their vicinity, by keeping at a distance from any great eddies, the strength of which is in proportion to the shallowness of the water that occasions them. tides. \u2014 The tidal streams follow the direction of the coast between St. Valery-en-caux and Dieppe, and their rate at springs is about 3-jL knots ; but near Sottevilie and Ailly points they run 4 knots. PORT de Dieppe.\u2014 This commercial and fishing port lies E. by S. 5 miles from Ailly point, and with the town and the suburb of Le Pollet occupies the entire entrance of a valley, nearly a mile wide, which is watered by the rivers Arques, Bethune, and Aune. The population of Le Pollet suburb, which is situated to the eastward of the town and joined to it by a flying bridge, are all engaged in the herring, oyster, and cod fisheries. There are sugar-refineries, rope walks, paper mills, and ship building yards in the town. The coasting trade is active. Steamers ply daily to Newhaven on the coast of Sussex. The number of vessels of all kinds that entered and left the harbour in 1856 was 2,245, with cargoes amounting to 342,703 tons. The port consists of a tidal harbour, or Avant-port, two floating basins, and a capacious reservoir of scouring water. The harbour is sheltered from all winds, and will admit vessels of about 22 feet draught at high-water ordinary springs when there is no swell on the bar, and of about 15 feet at neaps. When the state of the sea is such as to prevent the pilots from boarding vessels in the offing, they remain on the jetty heads and direct them by waving their hats. Those drawing * This Riden is named by the mariners of Treport the Frilandais."], [122, "106 CAPE DANTIFER TO CAPE GRIS-NEZ. [chap. hi. less than 10 feet can enter the channel 2 hours before high water in the harbour, and with afresh leading wind they may run in 2 hours after high water ; vessels of large draught are taken in by the pilots during the last hour of the flood. The berths alongside the quays of the town are com posed of a mixture of mud and shingle, and their elevation is about 15 feet above the level of the lowest tides. The berths alongside Le Pollet suburb are about the same height, but they are exposed to the surf when the sea is high at the entrance. The Entrance Channel lies on the eastern side of the valley at nearly 2 cables from the high cliffs of Femme-Grosse point, and is open to the N.N.W. It is enclosed between the northern part of the quays of the town and Le Pollet suburb, and forms a curve 3^- cables long from the harbour. The outer part of the channel is liable to be obstructed at times by the shingle which is driven along the shore during westerly winds, and accumulates in front of the entrance, where it sometimes forms a high bar. The shingle also gets into the channel at the neaps, when it blows hard from the northward. The bottom of the channel is of the same nature as the cliffs along the coast, and is generally covered with a layer of shingle, but when it is clear it is ahout a foot above the level of low-water great springs across by the east jetty head, and 5 or 6 feet above the same level at the entrance to the harbour ; the bar has been sometimes 6 feet above the same level, and has joined the west jetty head. A high sea runs on the bar with winds from W.S.W., round westerly, to N.E., and those from the westward cause a heavy confused sea at the entrance. Floating Basins. \u2014 The outer floating basin, 2 cables long and two -thirds ofa cable wide, is separated from the Avant-Bort by a dam with flood gates, which are 49 feet wide, their lower sill being 6 feet 2 inches above the level ofthe lowest tides; quays border it on all sides, and it communicates with the other floating basin by gates 46 feet wide, the lower sleepers of which are 7 feet 3 inches above the same level. The surface of the reservoir of scouring water is about 500,000 square yards, and it is esti mated that during the first hour of the sluices being open it will discharge 560,000 cubic yards. The waters of the rivers, which fertilize the valley, run partly into the reservoir and partly into a canal joining the upper part of the outer basin with which it communicates by a valve gate. -lights The following lights have been established on the jetties at Dieppe to point out at night the time that the entrance channel is practicable : \u2014 K fixed white light, dioptric and of the fourth order, is shown, at 39 feet above high water, from a stone tower standing at 38 yards from the head"], [123, "CHAP, in.] PORT DE DIEPPE. 107 of the west jetty. This light is lit as soon as there are 10-J feet water in the entrance channel, and extinguished as soon as the ebb stream com mences, which occurs about a quarter of an hour after high water. Three fixed white lights are attached to a mast standing 33 feet from the east jetty head. The first is a permanent light, shown throughout the night at 23 feet above high water, and visible 4 miles off. The second is a tidal light, placed 8 feet above the permanent light, and shown from 1\\ hours before till 2 hours after high water. The third is also a tidal light, placed between the former two ; it is lighted 2 hours before high water, and extinguished at high water. The two latter are only lighted when the state of the sea is favourable for access to the harbour. The mast which carries the lights is kept in a vertical position while the vessel preserves her proper course ; but should she deviate, the mast is inclined to that side towards which she should steer. Vessels desirous of profiting by these signals should show two lights, one forward and one aft. The time that the entrance is practicable during the day, is shown by a large national flag hoisted on a mast in front of the light tower. The flag is hoisted as soon as there are 10^ feet water in the channel, and hauled down when the ebb stream commences. Should the bar be so high that it cannot be crossed without danger, or if the channel should be blocked up by a vessel grounding in it, signals will be made by hoisting a red flag instead of the national colours ; and at night, the mast which carries the three lights on the east jetty will be placed in a horizontal position. directions \u2014 The hill separating the valleys of Pourville and Dieppe, and the chapel of St. Nicolas built on the summit of the hill, are marks that will assist in recognizing the position of Dieppe when approaching it from the north or the north-west. The valley of Pourville is the most remarkable valley on this part of the coast, being the only one that descends to the beach ; it is watered by the little river Scic, which finds a passage through the shingle to the sea. A vessel of large draught arriving off Dieppe during the neaps is entitled to a pilot to take charge of her at sea, until there is sufficient depth to enter at the springs. When standing for the land with westerly winds towards the hour of low water, a position should be maintained, by making short tacks between Ailly point and St. Nicolas chapel, till there is water to run for the west jetty head ; with easterly winds a vessel should keep on the meridian of the chapel. With off-shore winds in fine weather, or in a calm, she may anchor for a few hours in 3\u00a3 fathoms water, at about half a mile from the shore to the North or N.N.W. of"], [124, "108 CAPE DANTIFER TO CAPE GRIS-NEZ. [chap. iii. St. Nicolas chapel. The name of Dieppe road has been given to this anchorage, but as it affords no shelter with northerly winds, it should be left with all speed, and a good offing gained as soon as there is an appear ance ofa change. In standing for the harbour, the west jetty head should be steered for, whatever may be the direction of the wind, because the flood stream, as far as half a cable outside the jetty heads, continues to be felt 40 minutes after high water in the harbour, and runs to the eastward at the rate of ll knots during the whole time vessels of large draught might enter. If this precaution is not taken with a light wind, the vessel will be drifted to the eastward of the channel. The west jetty head should be approached with caution, and when there is no pilot on board sufficient sail should be carried to execute quickly any change of course the pilots on the jetty may direct by waving their hats. Moderate winds between N.N.W., round northerly, and E.N.E. are the most favourable for entering Dieppe; with all other winds it will be neces sary, after the bar is crossed, for a vessel to steer for the windward jetty to be tracked in. The direction of the valley of Dieppe has a great influence upon off-shore winds; thus if the wind is E.S.E. in the offing, it will be found S.S.E. at the entrance of the harbour, and if West outside, it will be S.W. in the harbour and entrance channel. A W7.S.W. wind is reflected by the high cliff between Le Pollet suburb and Femme- Grosse point, and its force is much weakened ; a vessel, therefore, running for the harbour with the wind between W.S.W. and W.N.W. should carry considerable sail to cross the bar and broken water which is caused by these winds at the entrance. tides and tidai signals At Dieppe it is high water, full and change, at llh. 6m. When the bottom of the entrance channel, across by the east jetty head, is clear of shingle occasionally deposited there, the tide rises upon it about 28^ feet at ordinary springs ; 31 feet at great springs ; and 22 at neaps. Three feet must be deducted from the above quantities for the rise above the bar when in its medium state; 3 feet for the entrance of the harbour ; 6 feet for the berths at the Dieppe quays ; 9 feet for the sill of the flood-gates of the odter floating basin ; and 11 feet for the sill of the inner basin. Fresh westerly winds cause the tide to rise a foot or 18 inches higher than in calm weather, and easterly winds have a contrary effect. The greatest tide takes place about 52 hours after the conjunction ; and the smallest tide occurs about 63 hours after the quadrature. The mean duration of the flood on the beach at Dieppe is 5h. 40m., and that of the ebb is 6h. 45m."], [125, "CHAP. III.] PORT DE DIEPPE. ROCHES DU HEAUME. 109 The tidal signals for indicating the depth of water in this port are the same as those noticed in page 3. The coast from Dieppe trends about E. by N. 13^ miles to Treport, and is formed, like that which precedes it to the westward, of a high perpendicular cliff of chalk and flint, intersected by numerous vallies. The land adjacent to the cliff is slightly undulated, the highest parts being in the vicinity of Penly village and on the western point of the entrance of Criel valley, where the cliff is surmounted by a remarkable conical mound covered with heath, named Mont Jolibois, the base of which is half a mile wide.* The valleys that may he recognized from the offing are Puits, Belle ville, Berneval, Penly, Neuvillette, Criel, and Mesnil. Puits valley descends to the shore at a mile to the eastward of Dieppe, and at the top of its eastern steep edge are the remains of an ancient Roman encampment, named Camp de Cesar. The valleys of Berneval and Penly, the third and fourth to the eastward of Dieppe, are separated by per pendicular high land, a third of a mile in length, and communicate with the beach by ravines which the floods of rain have hollowed out. Criel valley, situated at the foot of Mont Jolibois, is half a mile wide at its entrance, and is watered by the little river Yeres, which reaches the sea by forming a passage for itself through the bank of shingle at the entrance of the valley. The valley of Mesnil lies 2 miles to the westward of Treport, and the bottom of it almost reaches the beach. roches du heatok. \u2014 The whole of the above coast is bordered by a rocky ledge, which uncovers at low water, and a large quantity of shingle is heaped np at the foot of the cliffs. The ledge, throughout the greater part of its extent, is not more than 2 cables wide ; but in three places it projects farther out, and is dangerous to small vessels hugging the coast with off-shore winds. The western projection of this ledge runs out half a mile from the shore, in front of Berneval and Penly valleys ; the rocks are uneven, and the highest heads, named Roches du Heaume, lie at the outer edge of the ledge, and uncover 5 or 6 feet at low water. roches du nsiJRON The second projection of the above ledge fronts the valley of Mesnil ; it extends 4 cables from the shore, and upon it are a rocky group named Roches du Muron, which bear N.W. 3 cables from the guard-house at Mesnil, and uncover 8 feet.

Between the Granges and the Haumes there is an isolated rock which uncovers 14| feet. A beach of muddy sand and gravel dries at low water in front of the rocks bordering the shore, from abreast of Belleville valley to the rocks at the foot of Mers cliff, east of Treport valley. Between the meridians of Dieppe and Treport the bottom is uneven, and the depths irregular as far out as 4 or 5 miles from the shore. The prin cipal inequalities met with are those heaps of sand and broken shells named the Ridens de Belleville, de Neuvillette, de Treport, and le bane Franc-Marque. ridens de Belleville lying about 3 miles from the shore in a N.N.W. direction from Berneval valley, are narrow ridges running parallel with each other in a N.N.W. and S.S.E. direction, and the least water on them is about 25 feet. The tidal streams occasion strong eddies amongst these ridges, and small vessels would subject themselves to a heavy sea in crossing them in bad weather during a weather tide. ridens de neuvillette are small narrow sand-banks, upon which there are from 4 to 5 fathoms at the lowest tides. They commence about 6 cables from the shore abreast Neuvillette valley, and extend nearly 2 miles into the offing. The eddies upon them are in general less dangerous to small vessels than those on the Ridens de Belleville. ridens de treport are four narrow ridges running parallel with each other in a N.N.W. and S.S.E. direction, at from 2^ to 3\u00a3 miles from the coast, and occupying the space of a mile from east to west.

From Mont Jolibois to Treport there are many patches of a black sub stance met with, which appear to be peat, and the anchors penetrate them so deeply that they are difficult to weigh. A bottom, upon which the soundings are less than 5 fathoms, extends a mile from the shore in front of Criel valley and Treport, and its outer edge runs parallel with the coast as far as the meridian of Mers ; it then turns back to the westward round the Franc-Marque bank, leaving a small deep, with 5 fathoms water in it, between the bank and the shore, with excellent holding ground. treport is a commercial and fishing port, situated at the entrance of Bresle valley,* the last valley but one to the eastward of all those which break the outline of the uniform cliffs between Cape Antifer and the river Somme. The entrance is half a mile wide, between abrupt hills rising 295 feet above high water, and at the foot of the cliff, in the southern part of the valley, stands the town of Treport, the houses of which are overtopped by a terrace and a large church built half-way up the hill. The village of Mers is built upon the slope of the hills, in the northern angle of the valley, and a little to the eastward of it, on a plain surrounded by hills covered with wood, rises the Royal residence of the town of Eu. The port consists of an entrance channel, formed between two wooden jetties, a tidal harbour, a floating basin, and an immense reservoir of scouring water, immediately behind the harbour, with a surface of 200,000 square yards, communicating with the river Bresle by means of the Pen thievre canal. As the entrance channel is sometimes obstructed by a bar, rising 3 and 4 feet above the bottom of the channel, the harbour will at that time only admit vessels of about 12 feet draught at high- water ordi nary springs ; but, as it lies almost at the bottom of the elbow which the coast forms between Capes Antifer and Gris-Nez, it offers a refuge at the springs to small craft that may be drifted in upon the land between Dieppe and the mouth of the river Somme, either by the flood stream or strong winds from the westward. Pilots can always be obtained in moderate weather, and it will be prudent to take one when the state of the bar is not known. Bar. \u2014 The beach, which uncovers in front of the entrance as far as a quarter of a mile outside the jetty-heads, is bounded to the westward by the Haumes and the Granges rocks, and to the eastward by the rocks * View 19."], [128, "112 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRIS-NEZ. [chap. iii. that dry at low water at the foot of the high cliffs at Mers point. It is composed of a mixture of sand, gravel, and shingle cemented together with chalky mud, and forms a hard ground, upon which a high sea runs when the wind blows upon the shore. When it blows hard from the N.W. the shingle, brought from the westward with up-channel winds, accumulates before the entrance channel and forms a bar which joins the west jetty-head, and extends from thence to the N.N.E. and N.E. Should a continuation of gales from the westward bring a large quantity of shingle upon the beach, the bar then forms a high round ridge which is difficult for the scouring water to break through, and during the time this ridge exists the channel turns to the N.N.E. and N.E. and gives some trouble to enter it with southerly winds. The Entrance Channel is about a cable long, in a N. by W. direction, and its eastern side is enclosed by a wooden jetty, abutting against the western extremity of the natural bank of shingle which protects Bresle valley from the invasion of the sea, and shelters the harbour from the northward ; its western side is bounded by the wall, which supports the terrace joining to the quays of the harbour, and by an open pile work, the top of which, serves as a road for the tracking crew and a communication between the terrace and the west jetty-head. The west jetty is only 109 yards long, and joins the terrace near the commencement of the open pile-work. The channel is in its best possible state when the west jetty-head is entirely freed from shingle by the united concurrence of the scouring water, the freshes of the river Bresle, and the direction of the wind ; the shingle composing the bar is then soon driven along the shore to the eastward. In the year 1841, as in 1835, the highest part of the bottom of the channel abreast the open pile-work which unites the west jetty-head to the wall supporting the terrace, the bottom of the harbour, and part of the beach adjoining the entrance channel, were all about 131 feet above the level of the lowest tides ; \"but the height of the shingle banks forming the bar are variable, and o-enerally rise 3 or 4 feet above the beach, and sometimes much higher. Should it blow fresh from the northward during the neaps when the bar is high; the shingle is then driven into the entrance channel, and the eddy occasioned on the flood by the west jetty-head heaps it up along the wall supporting the terrace ground, where it forms a large bank, expending from the commencement ofthe open pile-work of the jetty to the entrance of the harbour, and frequently fills up the channel. In its ordinary state the top of this bank rises above high-water springs, and forms a slope which extends almost as far as the cast jetty, and it is at the foot of tbis slope and along this jetty that the deepest part of the channel is then found"], [129, "CHAr. III.] TREPORT. 113 The Harbour is only li cables' long and half a cable wide. The freestone bottom is visible almost throughout its whole extent, but at the foot of the quays it is covered with mud sufficiently soft to ground -on. Vessels lie alongside the quay on the southern side of the har bour, but the most level berths and the most water are alongside the quay on the western side, where those of 10 feet draught lie aground for three days only at the neaps, and are well sheltered from the swell which runs into the harbour from 2 hours before to 2 hours after high water when the wind blows strong on the shore. Works are in progress for improving the harbour, for turning a part of the course of the river Bresle into a floating basin, for straighten ing or rather forming that river into a canal from Treport to Eu, and for constructing a small wet dock in the north-west part of that town. The head of the canal is finished ; the lock basin is 26 feet wide at the bottom, and 147\u00a3 feet long, and communicates with the harbour and the lower part of the Bresle by means of flood-gates, and it is intended to retain at all times a depth of 13 feet to enable vessels that can enter Treport to remain afloat. The canal will form a communication between Treport and Eu, and vessels of less than 12^ feet draught will be able to get up to the latter town, if that depth can at all times be maintained in the canal. lis-zzt. \u2014 A red brick tower stands at 25 yards from the west jetty head at Treport, and a fixed white light is shown from it as soon as there are 6^ feet wrater in the entrance channel, and extinguished three quarters of an hour after the moment of high water. The light, which is dioptric and of the fourth order, is elevated 36 feet above high water, and visible in clear weather at 10 miles. During the day a large -national flag is hoisted on a mast in front of the light tower, when there are 8^ feet in the channel, and is kept up until hi-rli water ; but as soon as the ebb commences it is lowered to half-mast, in which position it remains while there is sufficient water for the fishing-boats. When the tide does not rise sufficiently high at the neaps to admit vessels of more than 6^ feet draught, the light is only shown at night at the moment of high water, and extinguished 5 or 6 minutes after. In the same manner the flag is hoisted during the day and hauled down 4 or 5 minutes after. If from any cause the entrance is impracticable, the time of high water is nevetheless made known by signal either by day or night ; but the flag is immediately hauled down or the light extinguished.

[chap, iii- Directions. \u2014 If a vessel's draught will admit of her entering Treport harbour, she will have nothing to fear in ordinary weather from the banks and Ridins in its vicinity, but they must be avoided when there is much wind, as she might then ship some heavy seas. In running for the har bour from the westward, or northward, with westerly winds, the land should be made about Criel valley, under Mont Jolibois, so that if she arrives long before high water a position may be retained to windward of the harbour until there is sufficient depth to enter. At night the lights of Ailly and Cayeux are excellent guides for Treport. There is anchorage with off-shore winds and smooth water, to stop tide, in 7 fathoms, over broken shells and sand, at 2 miles to the west ward of Treport and li miles from the shore abreast Mesnil- Val, but vessels must be prepared to weigh should the wind come in from the offing. This anchorage is named the Petite rade by the mariners of Treport; that which they call the Grande rade is half a mile farther from the coast, and vessels having to remain some time for water to enter the harbour may anchor in it, over a muddy bottom and excellent holding ground, with off-shore winds as long as the weather is fine, but they should weigh immediately and quit the coast on the appearance of a change. When running for Treport with a strong S.W. wind, the two wind mills at Ault must be kept well open to the northward of Siez* cliffs, E. 4 N., to avoid passing too close to the Haumes and Granges rocks on which the sea breaks even at high water. Vessels of large draught should endeavour to enter between the periods of half an hour before and half an hour after high-water springs ; and as the flood stream runs at the rate of from 1-^ to 2 knots at 3 or 4 cables outside the jetties, and continues to be felt with less velocity until 1^ hours after high water, they must take care they are not drifted to leeward of the entrance, which however is rarely missed in moderate. weather, but it sometimes happens with strong S.W. winds when the entrance channel turns to the north-eastward. The pilots cannot go out to meet vessels when the sea is high upon the beach and the bar ; in running for the harbour, therefore, with strong winds from the offing, the anchors should be clear for letting go, the hawsers coiled on deck, an anchor ready to moor by the stern, and sufficient sail carried to perform any necessary man\u0153uvre. These arrangements being made, steer so as to pass close to the west jetty-head, where the pilots will be found, who will point out by signs the various changes to be made in the course to cross the bar and to enter the channel. * View 18."], [131, "CUAP. III.] tr\u00a3port. 115 If with a strong westerly wind a vessel be driven to leeward of the entrance, she ought to anchor, should the state of the weather permit. and wait until the ebb stream commences, to gain an offing; but if the sea is too high near the shore, where indeed the holding is not good, she should seek for anchorage in the small deep under the lee of the Franc Marque bank (page 111), where she will be in some degree sheltered, and with two anchors down and a long scope of cable out she might ride out the flood and gain an offing on the ebb. If the wind is too far to the northward to reach this deep or to claw of the coast, the only resource will be to run stem on the shingle beach with all sail set, as near as possible to the cast jetty ; the shingle yields readily under a vessel, and if she takes the ground near the top of high water the crew will be saved. With off-shore winds the harbour should be entered before high water. With a moderate wind and a smooth sea to the beach, a vessel may easily get in close to the west jetty-head, where a crew is always at hand to track in. With strong off-shore winds violent squalls come down from the cliffs and out of the valleys, and it often happens that when standing for the jetty on the starboard tack a vessel is taken aback in the midst of the rollers on the bar. When leaving the harbour, and bound to the northward, do not go to the eastward of the line on which the eastern extremity of the trees surrounding Grange farm, situated above Treport, is seen a quarter of a point open to the westward of the summit of the cliff at Mers point bearing about S.

Nino valleys break the uniformity of the aspect of the coast between Treport and Ault, and the shore is bordered by a rocky shelf which in some places uncovers a quarter of a mile from the cliffs at low water, the sea leaving a narrow beach of hard sand in front of the shelf. The hills trend in an E. by N. direction from Ault to the left bank of the river Somme, and join by easy slopes the alluvial plain which extends to the sea. This plain is low, marshy, and apparently level, and is defended from the incursions of the sea by a natural dyke of shingle, brought hither by the wasting of the cliffs between Ault and Cape Antifer. Behind the dyke, which is 2 cables broad, are meadows and cultivated lands, and in front of it a beach of hard sand which uncovers half a mile out. The coast between Treport and Cayeux is inaccessible when the wind blows upon the shore, and a heavy sea runs in upon it during westerly gales. The beach between Ault and the first guard-house to the north ward is exposed to all the violence of winds between W.S.W. and N.W., and the high sea occasioned by these winds drives the shingle collected at the foot of the cliffs between Treport and Ault rapidly towards the guard-house, and beyond it. It frequently occurs, after westerly gales, that there is little or no shingle upon this beach, which has occa sioned much remark. Was it not for a small artificial dyke constructed here, the sea would make an inroad upon the plain. cayeu'E. \u2014 The low coast which commences at Ault trends in a straight line to the north-east to the town of Cayeui:, which is built on the shore in the midst of sand-hills. The town is partly inhabited by fishermen, and as the coast affords no shelter for their boats, they haul them up above high-water mark in the summer, and in the winter place them for shelter in the little harbour of Hourdel, within the mouth of the Somme. The only remarkable objects on this part of the coast are the houses of Cayeux, its\u00bb church, particularly the bell tower, and five windmills situated in and around the town. In westerly gales the sea heaps up upon the shore in front of the northern part of the town a great quantity of sand, which is carried away by the high winds into the interior. Within a mile to the southward of Cayeux church is a sheet of water named the Hable-d'Ault, where the greater part of the fresh water of the plain is collected.

The light is dioptric and of the third order, and visible in clear weather at 15 miles ; but the fog, which rises from the low damp ground covered with wood in the rear ofthe lighthouse, sometimes obscures it. A fixed white tidal light is shown at 812 yards to the S.W. of Cayeux light, to point out the south channel into the Somme. It is lighted at 3-J- hours after the beginning of the flood, at the entrance of the channel, and put out at 17 hours after the beginning of the ebb.

Hourdel point, in many respects, resembles Hoc point, noticed in page 75 ; both increase by suc cessive deposits of shingle brought by the tide and the surf, and the eddy on the flood has given them nearly the same shape. Between Hourdel point and St. Valery-sur-Somme the shore is low and forms an elbow half a mile deep, the land being defended from the incur sion of the sea by an embankment, in front of which is some marshy land and a wide beach, parts of which are hardly covered at high water springs. The town of St. Valery and the suburb of La Ferte, which forms a part of it, occupy a space of 1^- miles along the shore, and are built on the north slope of a group of hills forming the northern point of the high land between the rivers Somme and Bresle ; the north-west hill. the best seen from the offing, has upon its summit a clump of tall trees and a windmill. The harbour of St. Valery is at the eastern part of the town, and ends the sea navigation of the mouth of the Somme. .Since the waters of this river and the streams flowing into it above Abbeville run out by the canal, the sand, rwhich the flood stream drives into the river, has in a great measure filled up its former bed, and the lighters or discharging vessels (when laden the)' draw about 3 feet water) can hardly get up as far as the village of Grand Port, on the right bank, 5 miles above St. Valery. RIGHT bank of the SOMME.\u2014 The northern shore of this estuary trends in a N.N.W. and S.S.E. direction, and the most conspicuous object on it is the little town of Le Crotoy-, built on a projecting point at 21 miles to the E.S.E. of Hourdel point and ]-| miles to the N.N.E. of St. Valery ; the ruins of the fortifications, four windmills, showing above the ruins, the church tower, and the roofs of some of the houses serve to mark its position from a distance.

The south part of St. Quentin point, seen from Le Crotoy, is about 4 miles to the N.N.AV. of that town, and in the intermediate space the coast recedes a mile and forms an elbow, at the bottom of which the little river Maie (which receives a large portion of the waters of the Marquentcrre) loses itself upon an elevated beach.

St. Quentin poiut is rounded, and forms a slight projection on the shore, at a mile to the northward of the point that is visible from Lo Crotoy, and where the coast undergoes a sudden change in its direction. The only object which serves to point out its position from seaward is a guard-house built among the sand-hills on the point. These hills are higher here than upon the coast to the S.S.E., and those on the point may be seen in clear weather at 8 or 10 miles. PASSES de 1' EMBOUCHURE de la somme The whole space included between the shores of the estuary just described is nearly en tirely filled with an immense mass of sand which the sea leaves dry, and which extends into the offing as far as 1-| miles outside a line drawn from Cayeux point to St. Quentin point. The surface of this sand is subject to the sport of the winds and the tides, every day furrowed afresh by the streams, and the sand being shifting is formed into banks, the shape and height of which are extremely variable. The banks at the entrance, taken as a whole, from the parallel of Cayeux to that of St. Quentin point form a slope, the inclination of which is gradual seaward, but steep towards the land ; their highest parts extend from N.W. of Cayeux lighthouse to North of Hourdel point, and are not covered at the lowest neaps. Outer channels. \u2014 None but fishing-boats or small coasters piloted by the mariners of the place, can enter the Somme by the narrow winding channel under St. Quentin point. The principal entrance into the Somme lies amongst the southern part of the banks, abreast of Cayeux and the lighthouse. It consists of two narrow channels, each 2 miles long, separated from each other by a bank, some parts of which uncover 11 or 12 feet at the lowest tides. The northern channel runs in a N.W. and the southern channel in a S.W. direction from Cayeux lighthouse.

The red buoy may be seen from a great distance, and should always be sighted when approaching the banks ; when near it Lemot windmill will be open about a degree to the southward of Cayeux church, and the eastern end of the Grange wood, above Treport, will be about the same distance open to the westward of Mers cliff, S.W.

Chenal de la Somme. \u2014 The two narrow channels just described, when north of the lighthouse, unite and form one channel, 2 cables wide, which follows the direction of the shore as far as Napoleon guardhouse, at three-quarters of a mile to the westward of Hourdel point, and is called, in consequence of its unchanging nature, the Somme or entrance channel. This channel dries in some places at low water, and in the other parts the soundings are very irregular. Its western side is marked by a white buoy, moored upon the steep edge of the banks west of Hourdel guard house ; a second white buoy, moored to the northward of the fourth black buoy of the north-west channel, marks the spot where, when following this channel, a vessel must steer to the N.E., in order to enter the Somme channel, and it should be left on the port hami. At 3 hours flood the stream in the Somme channel runs 6 or 7 knots at springs ; but be3'ond the guard-house the channel widens, and the stream in some degree loses its strength. Inner channels. \u2014 The approaches to Hourdel point arc encumbered by banks of shifting sand, the greater part of which do not cover till 2i hours flood. From this cause the rapid stream, that enters the Somme channel till this hour of tide, continues to run to the north-east between these banks and the eastern edge of the high bank barring the mouth of the Somme, and does not run to the eastward until it is forced in that direc tion by the stream which enters from the north-west, and by the beach on the northern shore of the estuary. The stream then follows the course of this beach until abreast Le Crotoy, when the banks turn it to the south-east, towards St. Valery. When the banks around Hourdel point are covered, the flood finds a passage along the southern shore of the estuary, and its speed slackens considerably. The channel formed by the tide along this shore is sinuous, uneven, extremely variable, and less deep than that leading to Le Crotoy, which it is separated from by shifting sands ; the junction of these two * View 20."], [137, "chap, in.] EMBOUCHURE DE LA SOMME ; PORT DU HOURDEL. 121 channels is marked by a black buoy moored N.E. by N., 6 cables' lengths from Hourdel harbour, but they should never be attempted without a pilot. directions. \u2014 Vessels arriving off the mouth of the Somme with westerly winds, before there is sufficient water for them to pass through either of the outer channels, should keep a position on the meridian of Mers cliff, and to the .S.W. of Cayeux church tower ; or, if the weather will permit, they may anchor in about 7-i* fathoms, good holding ground, on the meridian of the cliff, and W. by N. of Cayeux ; with off-shore winds they can anchor to the westward of the large red buoy, moored outside the banks. When the narrows are practicable, a red flag is hoisted on a staff, close to the north-west of the lighthouse, at 4 hours flood. With off-shore winds the flag is hauled down as soon as the ebb commences, but with westerly winds it is kept flying three quarters of an hour after high water. The banks bounding the outer channels are liable to such change that vessels which, in consequence of their tonnage, arc subject to pilot dues, should never attempt to enter without pilots. But it sometimes happens that the state of the sea will not admit of pilots going out to vessels requiring them, or to the assistance of those that may be embayed off the mouth of the Somme and are obliged to run in, which is always practicable towards high-water springs when the red flag has been seen, and the position of the black buoys at the entrance of the channels well ascertained. To supply as far as possible the want of a pilot on board, a tall flag staff has been erected N.E., half a mile from Cayeux lighthouse, upon the mast of which a red flag is hoisted, and made to incline right and left to direct a vessel in the channels ; if she has entered and is steering a proper course, the flag-staff is kept in a vertical position, if not, it is drooped on the side towards which she should steer. These signals arc made to vessels of all sizes when they have demanded a pilot. port du HOURDEL. \u2014 Since the Hable d'Ault (noticed in page 116) has been closed up, the elbow the shore makes within Hourdel point served as a place of refuge for the Cayeux fishing boats, but the constant increase of the sands threatening to fill it up, a small harbour was made to shelter coasting craft. In 1841 the harbour consisted of a small dry basin, from 270 to 325 yards long and 76 wide. Works arc now going on for its improvement, and it is proposed to form a reservoir of scouring water, the site of which will be 10 feet above the bottom of the harbour, to clear it and the entrance ; when finished the harbour will contain about 30 vessels well secured.

Strong winds from the westward cause the tide to rise a foot or two higher, and easterly winds have a contrary effect. PORT de ST. valert-sur-somme is, properly speaking, the con tinuation of the Somme canal outside the lock. An earthern embank ment, 1,100 yards long, which begins at the lock and terminates in an open stockade 70 yards long, shelters it from north to east, and it is bounded on the west and south by the shore of La Ferte suburb, a part of which, 438 yards long, has been coverted into a quay. The population of St. Valery in 1856 was 3,440, and of the canton 14,744. In the same year, 189 vessels, of 20,010 tons, entered inwards, and 222 vessels, of 20,400 tons, cleared outwards. The exports were, chalk, vegetables, sand, and ballast ; and the imports, wood, coal, pig iron, wheat, cheese, flax, sulphur, wool, and linseed. This harbour is quite sheltered from both winds and sea, and will contain from 30 to 35 vessels lying against the quays, or 60 or 70 when placed in a double tier, and they ground every tide upon a bottom of chalky mud mixed with sand and some shingle. A regular depth is maintained in the harbour now that the water collected in the canal is used for scouring. A causeway or embankment has been made from the harbour, and it is in the intention of Government to continue it in a direct line to Hourdel. At present, in 1857, it only reaches half way to Hourdel, but it has so improved the channel from the latter port to St. Valery, that vessels of 9 and 10 feet draught can navigate it at neaps, and of 13 and 14 feet at springs. tides. \u2014 The tide rises above the level of the berths in St. Valery harbour, (which dry 13^ feet above the level ofthe lowest tides,) from 20 to 21 feet at great springs, 17 to 18 feet at ordinary springs, and about 8"], [139, "chap, in.] EMBOUCHURE DE LA SOMME ; PORT ST.

The current from this channel has formed a creek in the mud, in which fishing boats take shelter. Le Crotoy occupies an advantageous position as far as relates to the circuitous course the flood stream makes in the mouth of the Somme during the time it has most strength. This stream clears out the channel in front of Le Crotoy and renders it almost always deeper than the others. light. \u2014 A fixed white light, catoptric and of the sixth order, and visible at 4 miles, points out at night the position of Port Crotoy.

[chap. III. BANCS de SOMME. \u2014 The banks generally designated the Somme banks are, the Bassurelle de la Somme, the Quemer, the Battur, and the south west part ofthe Bassure de Baas. Those dangerous banks lying in Dover strait, viz., the Varne, the Colbart, the Bassurelle, the Ridens, and the Vergoyer, have been described in Part I., Chap. VI., of Channel Pilot. There is always sufficient water upon the Somme banks to admit of vessels crossing them, when bound for the mouth of the Somme. From the south-west end of the Bassure de Baas, the land can only be seen in fine weather, and although the eddies on these banks occasion a heavy sea when it blows hard, yet there is nothing to mark their position ; the soundings on them, however, differ sufficiently from those in the channels between them to enable the mariner to know his position with reference to the banks and the land. The Quemer and the Bassurelle de la Somme appear to be the lengthening out of that immense mass of sand and broken shells which forms the submarine slope along the shore from St. Valery-en-Caux to the mouth ofthe river Canche. La bassurelle de la somme and Le qusmer spread towards the south-west, across the mouth of the Somme, and the latter bank ends about 11 miles NAV. by W., and the Bassurelle de la Somme 10 miles W. by N. -j N. of Cayeux lighthouse ; the channel separating them has no opening to the north-east, but terminates in the depth of 7 fathoms about 5 miles W.N.W. of St. Quentin point. Neither of these banks are dangerous, but they are joined to the shore by a shoal bottom on which the depth is less than 5 fathoms at low water, and which extends nearly 5 miles into the offing. This shoal bottom terminates in two points projecting in the direction of each of the banks, the first as far as 4^ miles West from St. Quentin point, and the other 6^ miles W.S.W. from Routhiauville point ; the latter is the most dangerous, its highest part having only from 14 to 17 feet water on it. Le battur lies in the channel separating the Quemer from the Bassure de Baas, and carries a depth from 6 to 8 fathoms. It is not dangerous to vessels of any draught, but the eddies on it cause a heavy sea when it blows hard. From its south extreme Cayeux lighthouse bears about S.E. by S. 13 miles, and from its north end the lighthouse on Haut-Banc point, S.E. by E. 6i miles. La bassure de baas, is a narrow bank of sand and shells, 35 miles long, beginning at 3^ miles to the south-west of Cape Gris-Nez, and li miles from the shore abreast Ambleteuse, and after following the direction of the coast as far as the mouth of the river Canche, it takes a south west direction, and terminates at about 18 miles from the shore a little to"], [141, "CHAP.

From its north end as far as 4 miles to the southward of the Canche, it is dangerous at low water to vessels of large draught ; its highest parts may indeed be touched upon by vessels of every description when there is any sea on at that time of tide. The shoalest and the most dangerous spot on this bank is a small flat, half a mile long in a north and south direction, with only 12 feet on it. lt lies nearly in the direction of the Colonne de la Grande- Armee (known as Buonaparte column, and which stands three-quarters of a mile to the northward of Boulogne), in line with Heurt fort, bearing E.N.E.,* and from it that fort bears N.E. by E. |- E., Cape Alprech lighthouse E. b. N.-^N., Gravois windmill E. by S., and the summit of Mont St. Frieux S. byE. | E. ; the sea breaks with great violence on the whole of the flat during strong westerly winds. For 14 miles to the southward of this flat, as far as West 8 miles from Touquet point, the shoalest parts of the Bassure de Baas form a succession of long narrow flats, upon which the depths vary from 20 to 26 feet, and the sea breaks heavily upon them when it blows hard from the westward. There are no dangers in the channel between the bank and the shore, but a high sea runs, when it blows strong on a weather tide, on some shoal spots carrying from 6 to 8 fathoms, and lying nearly in the middle of the channel. During bad weather, with winds between West and N.N.W., the sea is less disturbed in this channel than outside the Bassure de Baas, particularly from the mouth of the Canche to Cape Alprech. directions. \u2014 As the eastern side of the Bassure de Baas is steep to, the lead will be an uncertain guide to avoid the 12 feet patch on its northern part, when running in the channel between the bank and the shore ; but a vessel will keep in mid channel, when between the parallels of Gravois windmill and the guardhouse which stands upon the hills a quarter of a mile north of Brone rivulet, by steering with Creche point opening and shutting with Heurt fort. Great attention should be paid to the lead when approaching the channel between the Bassure de Baas and the Vergoyer from the north ward, for the northern part of the latter shoal presents a steep projecting* point at the outer edge of the 20 fathoms line of soundings approaching the French coast. A vessel running from the southward through this channel, which is 5 miles wide and carries a depth of from 14 to 23 fathoms, will avoid the Vergoyer by keeping in from 15 to 16 fathoms at low water throughout the whole length of the channel, allowing for the rise and fall of the tide."], [142, "126 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAPE GRIS-NEZ.

The intermediate shore is fronted by a beach which dries 1-J- miles in a S.W. direction from St. Quentin, and W.S.W. 1 mile from Routhiauville points, between which the beach is only half a mile wide. Great caution is necessary not to be caught on this part of the coast with strong westerly winds, for they cause a high sea upon the shoal bottom extending 5 miles from the shore, and increase the speed of the flood, which in calm weather runs 3 knots. The same winds also decrease the rate of the ebb, and no dependence can be reckoned upon the strength of this stream to assist in clawing off the coast. embouchure de i'authie is comprised between Routhiauville and Haut-Banc points, which bear N. by E. \\ E. and S. by W. i W. from each other, distant 24- miles. The entrance is filled with an enormous accumulation of sand and broken shells, which dries at half tide, and at low-water springs uncovers to 1^ miles westward of the meridian of the latter point. Routhiauville point is covered with sand hills, and the only remarkable object near it is a guardhouse standing amongst the highest hills at about 2 cables' lengths to the southward of the point. A sand bank, barely covered at high water neaps, joins this point and extends in a circuit of more than a mile between the bearings of N.N.W. and N.E. from the guardhouse. A similar bank surrounds Haut-Banc point and projects a mile between the bearings of W.S.W. and S.S.E. from the point, where it joins the shore. The channel into the Authie is principally kept up by the flood stream, which sets in with great rapidity until the banks are covered. The entrance to this channel lies between the banks just described, and runs in an easterly direction from the outer edge of the sands as far as the northern bank of the river, at one mile to the S.S.E. of Haut-Banc point ; it then, after rounding the north-east extreme of the sand bank joining Routhiauville point, subdivides into several branches, the principal of which turns to the southward, and terminates near the south bank of the river at about a mile to the eastward of the guardhouse on Routhiauville point. The tide rises in this latter part of the channel about 15 feet at springs, and the fishermen say that in a case of emergency a vessel of about 9 or 10 feet draught could be placed there in safety ; it is the only spot where the sea is tolerably smooth with westerly winds, for the waves"], [143, "chap, in.] EMBOUCHURE DE L'AUTHIE.

The lighthouse exhibits, at 66 feet above high water, a fixed white light, dioptric and ofthe fourth order, visible at 10 miles. The light is erected principally for the purpose of pointing out at night to the fishermen of Berck the position of the beach where they usually haul up their boats. directions. \u2014 The mouth of the river Authie is dangerous to ap proach, especially with westerly winds, on account of the flood stream which runs into it with great rapidity, and might draw a vessel upon the banks where she would become a total wreck. The channel is marked by beacons for the use of small fishing vessels of about 5 feet draught, belonging to the inhabitants of Groffliers, but they are not sufficient guides for a vessel seeking to enter, however small her draught. None should, indeed, attempt the entrance, unless under charge of one of the fisher men of Berck or of Groffliers, who alone are in a position to ascertain the changes which may take place in the channel. The coast from Haut-Banc point trends N.E. by N. 8 miles to Touquet point at the entrance of the river Canche. The shore is low and sandy, and bordered by a range of sand hills of moderate height. A sandy beach, half a mile wide, uncovers at the foot of the sand hills, and joins the accumulation of sand which obstructs the entrance of the rivers Authie and Canche. The low plain adjoining the shore extends to the foot of the hills, 3 or 4 miles inland, and is divided in its length into nearly two equal parts by a chain of sand-hills much higher than those bordering the beach, and which may be seen 8 or 9 miles off. This chain of hills may be confounded with those bordering the beach, although they are distant 1^ or 2 miles to the eastward, and it is important that this mistake should not occur when turning to windward along the coast in thick weather ; for in standing in-shore a vessel might ground upon the beach, when the consequence may be serious should the sea be running high. The objects which will serve to recognise this part of the coast are, the windmills of Verton and St. Josse, standing upon the hills in the interior ; the chain of sand-hills just described; the light tower on Haut-Banc point, and on Touquet point ; the five guardhouses standing at equal distances on the sand hills along the coast, and the church tower and windmills at"], [144, "128 CAPE D'ANTIFER TO CAFE GRIS-NEZ.

Like the estuaries of the Somme and the Authie, it is filled up with a mass of sand and broken shells, which is left dry at half ebb, and uncovers at low water as far as 1-t miles outside the entrance. The entrance points and the shores of the river are formed of sand hills of moderate height, the shapes of which are frequently changed by westerly gales. From Touquet point, the south shore of the estuary trends in a S.E. by S. direction as far as abreast of the small fishing and commercial harbour of Etaples, which can only admit vessels of small draught, and consists of grounding berths on muddy sand, lying between the passage channel and the shore on the north-west side of the town, and where piles have been driven to moor vessels to. None but those drawing at the utmost 9 feet water can get up to this harbour at the springs, and then they must be conducted by pilots, for if they ground upon the sides of the channel they run the risk of either breaking their backs or up setting. The north shore is low and winding, and between Etaples and Lornel point its general trend is N. by W. W. ; the two shores converge towards each other, and the river abreast the town is only a quarter of a mile wide. The surf and westerly winds carry towards the mouth of the Canche the sand of \"the beach south of Touquet point, and heap it up around that point where it forms a bank, the top of which is barely covered at neaps, and which extends in the circuit of nearly a mile between the bearings of N.N.W. and N.N.E. from the point. A similar bank is formed in front of Lornel point, extending a mile in a W.S.W. direction from it, and it is between these banks that the entrance channel is found which leads into the river. This channel is maintained by the alternate streams of flood and ebb, which arc very rapid during the whole time the banks remain uncovered, but the rate does not exceed 3 knots the last hour of the flood and the first hour of the ebb. During westerly \"\u25a0ales the sea is high at the entrance, and the waves caused by a stron\" S.W. wind cross it obliquely."], [145, "EMBOUCHURE DE LA CANCHE ; ETAPLES. 129 CHAP.

Buoys. \u2014 The direction of the entrance channel into the Canche, from the outer part of the banks, is marked by eight buoys, four of which, painted red, are moored on the northern edge of the bank joining Touquet point, and the remaining four, painted black, are moored abreast the former, on the southern edge of the bank joining Lornel point. They all bear the words La Canche, and the red buoys have even numbers on them, and the black buoys odd. The channel from thence up to staples is marked by poles.

By day the extremity of Cape Gris-Nez should be kept about half a point open to the westward of Cape Alprech. Vessels of more than 10 feet draught should never attempt to enter the mouth of the Canche without a pilot, or some person of local experience, unless they are driven into it by bad weather, or find themselves embayed amongst the sand banks. The pilots live at Etaples, and as it is impossible for them to board vessels outside when it blows hard from the westward, they meet them under shelter of the bank joining Touquet point, half-way between the inner black buoy and the first pole or beacon.

Small vessels without pilots, seeking shelter, should endeavour as soon as possible to get sight of the outer black buoy, and it is important not to pass to the northward of the parallel of Touquet point before it is sighted, for if they are set to the northward by the flood stream, which continues at its greatest strength outside the banks at the time of high water at Etaples, it would be impossible to regain the entrance. The most favourable moment for entering the Canche is about one hour before high water, for the stream then runs into the channel with sufficient strength to assist a vessel in threading the channel, and the water will rise enough to float her should she take the ground after passing the inner red buoy. Pass between the black and red buoys, leaving the first to port and the latter to starboard. After rounding the inner red buoy, giving it a berth of a cable's length, steer to the south ward for the first pole of the inner channel. The pilots place vessels, drawing from 10 to 11 feet water, at the springs, in the elbow which the channel forms between the three first poles from E.N.E. to E.S.E. of Touquet point, and they lie here in safety, even during westerly gales, protected by the high bank which joins Touquet point, and which dries from 21 to 23 feet above the level of the lowest tides. tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in the mouth ofthe Canche at llh. 20m., and the tide rises in the channel abreast the first pole (which stands N.E. 4 cables' lengths from Touquet point, and where the bottom dries 12 feet above the level of the lowest tides,) from 17 to 18 feet at ordinary springs, 19 to 20 feet at great springs, and about 10 feet at neaps. At Etaples, springs rise from 9 to 14^ feet above the sur face of the grounding berths, which dry 16 or 17 feet above the same level. The flood stream does not check the current of the Canche until about 3 hours after the tide has begun to rise upon the outer edge of the sand banks at the entrance. caution. \u2014 The little elevation of the land, as well as the dangers bordering the shore, render the navigation of the coast for an extent of 25 miles, from Cayeux to the mouth of the Canche, extremely dangerous in foggy or snowy weather, or during strong westerly gales accompanied by rain, when the weather is generally dark, the land covered with mist, and the most brilliant lights difficult to distinguish. To this may be added, that with these gales a few hours only suffice to raise a heavy sea in the eastern part of the Channel, and especially upon the edge of the great submarine slope which extends from the shore from St. Valery-en- Caux to the river Canche, so that the influence of the waves alone is suffi cient to cause a considerable drift. Besides this, when it is borne in mind"], [147, "CHAr. m.] EMBOUCHURE DE LA CANCHE. 131 that westerly gales tend to drive the water towards the bottom of the bight formed between Capes Antifer and Gris-Nez, and greatly influence the direction of the tidal streams (noticed in page 143), it will be seen how important it is, that a vessel should not run into the eastern part of the Channel, until her position is well ascertained by bearings of Cape Barfleur light, or of St. Catherine light on the south point of the Isle of Wight, and of using every precaution after these lights are lost sight of. The only safeguard that can be recommended under these circumstances is the frequent use of the lead, and to keep in at least 20 fathoms water, whatever be the time of tide ; this will not only avoid the dangers near the shore, but also the banks lying between the mouth of the river Somme and Dover channel. The coast from Lornel point trends N. by E. \\ E. 8^ miles to Cape Alprech, and from thence N.E. by E. 2\\ miles to Boulogne. The shore, which is low and bordered by sand hills of moderate height, runs in a straignt line from the mouth of the Canche to the Brone rivulet. This rivu let finds its way into the sea at 2 miles to the southward of the Cape, and is the northern limit of the low sandy shore forming the coast during an extent of 34 miles from the town of Ault. At a mile to the northward of the rivulet the coast has but little elevation, and several houses of the village of Equihen may be seen on the slopes of the hills running down to the shore ; but beyond this the coast is steep and formed of clay and schistose rocks of a dark grey colour. The high land separating the courses of the rivers Canche and Liane extends to the westward to within 1^ miles of the coast, and terminates near the meridian of Etaples in a chain of hills, many of which are of sufficient elevation to be seen in clear weather 25 miles off. These hills are excellent landmarks for the pilots on this coast, who have given them the name of terres de Tourmont, or Tourmont land, and upon the highest are the windmill of Faux and of Houlette, which are visible at a great distance ; the former stands 2\\ miles to the north-east, and the latter 4 miles to the northward of Etaples. At 1^ miles from the coast and 2\u00b1 miles to the northward of Houlette windmill, in front of the Tourmont land, is Mont St. Frieux, one of the most remarkable objects between the river Canche and Boulogne. It is composed of four mounds or hillocks, very near each other, rising from the same base and occupying a space of 14- miles north and south, and from its isolated position, as well as from the height of the hillocks, it may be seen in clear weather at the same distance as the Tourmont land. k 2"], [148, "132 CAPE d'aNTIFER TO CAPE GRIS-NEZ.

Upon the highest of the hills north of Brone rivulet is the church of St. Etienne-au-Mont and the windmills of Gravois, Alprech, Portel, and Outreau, all of which may be seen a considerable distance at sea. The sandy beach, which extends the whole length of this part of the coast to near Cape Alprech, uncovers at low water half a mile out from the foot of the sand hills, but north of Brone rivulet the shore is bordered by a shelf of irregular shaped rocks which dry a cable's length outside high water mark. cape d' alprech light. \u2014 Cape Alprech is a perpendicular rocky cliff, ofa brownish red colour, elevated 135 feet above the level of high water ; the foot of the cliff is skirted by a shelf of rock covered with boulders which dries a cable out at low tide. From the Cape the coast turns sharply to the north-east, and is high and steep to within 4 cables of the jetties at Boulogne.* A lighthouse stands on the summit of the Cape at about 87 yards from the edge of the cliff, near the tower of the old semaphore, and S.W. 2^ miles from the entrance to Boulogne. It exhibits, at an elevation of 161 feet above high water, a, fixed white light, varied every tivo minutes by a red flash, which is preceded and followed by a short eclipse. The light is dioptric and of the fourth order, and visible in clear weather at 12 miles. portel. \u2014 The coast between Cape Alprech and Boulogne is inter sected by vallies, and at the entrance of the largest is the village of Portel. This valley, situated 6 cables to the N.E. by E. of the Cape, is enclosed by high land, and on the summit of the hill on its north side stands the fortress of Mont Couple, which, in 1857, was in a state of dilapidation. The rocks which uncover at low water extend 4 cables into the offing from Portel, and upon their summit, N. by E. E. about half a mile from Cape Alprech, is the small fort of Heurt.

It consists of an entrance channel formed between two jetties, leading to a tidal harbour 3^- cables long and a cable wide, which is partly bordered by stone quays and communicates on its west side with a semicircular basin about a cable wide. Sailing vessels should not attempt to enter during heavy westerly gales, and steamers run great risk, on account of the heavy sea then on the bar ; and it should be remembered that during springs, when Boulogne is impracticable Calais can be entered, and the contrar}**. At the head of the harbour, and in the bed of the river, there is a reservoir of water for scouring the harbour and the entrance channel. The general trade of the port is extensive. In 1856 the number of vessels entered inwards from foreign ports was 1,224, of 180,929 tons; and 1,241, of 181,332 tons, cleared outwards. The principal imports are coal, cast iron, steel, wool, machinery, flax and tow, cotton, &c. ; and the exports, clocks, wine, grain, fruit and vegetables, Parisian articles, &c. &c. The herring and mackerel fisheries employ a considerable capital, and several vessels are fitted out for the Iceland cod fishery. The coasting trade is active, and there is constant communication by steamers with London, Hull, Dover, and Folkestone. The population of the town in 1856 was 34,739, about one-fifth of whom are English. The town stands on the east side of the harbour, and is built in the form of an amphitheatre at the bottom and on the sides of a small valley enclosed between high hills. The buildings, which may be recognised at sea, are the bell-tower and the cupola of the new cathe dral in the upper town, the spire of the church in the lower town, the marine baths, the windmill half-way up the hill to the south-east of the baths, and the new church of St. Pierre des Marins, on the top of the cliff. Entrance channel. \u2014 The two jetties enclosing the channel leading to the harbour are of unequal length, ancl run out on a sandy beach which the action of the sea has formed in front of the valley, and which uncovers half a mile out from the shore at the lowest tides. The channel is 4 cables long in a N.W. by N. and S.E. by S. direction, and 200 feet wide. The"], [150, "134 CAPE DANTIFER TO CAPE GRIS-NEZ. [CHAP. III. sand from the beach outside the jetties sometimes spreads itself across the entrance, and forms a sort of bar, rising 2 feet above the bottom of the channel, (which with the beach is about 2 or 3 feet above the level of the lowest tides,) but the bar is soon dispersed by the scouring water or by a sudden fresh of the river. The S.W. jetty is 735 yards long, and consists of a stone foundation, upon which is a wooden framework filled in and planked up to high water mark, which shelters the channel from the high sea during S.W. gales. The N.E. jetty, 547 yards long, runs parallel with the S.W. jetty, and like it consists of a stone foundation surmounted by an open framework. In order that the scouring water may follow the course of the channel beyond the S.W. jetty head, the N.E. jetty has been extended by the addition of a low breakwater, 500 yards long, composed of rough stonework for 150 yards from the jetty head, and continued in strong stake work the remainder of its length. The position of this breakwater, the top of which is from 3 to 9 feet above the level of low water, is marked by two black buoys, one placed near its outer extremity at 1^ cables from the outer end of the S.W. jetty, and the other about half a cable farther in. Harbour. \u2014 The N.E. jetty is joined to the quays of Boulogne by a quay along which are placed the steam vessels that perform the daily service between France and England. The bottom at the foot of this quay rises 6\\ feet above the level of the lowest tides, or 4 feet above that of the entrance channel between the jetty heads ; but it is hard and not fit for sharp laden vessels to ground upon for more than a few days. At high water ordinary neaps, those drawing from 12 to 13 feet can be brought alongside the quay ; vessels of larger draught lie aground there for four or five days. There is a slip way in the harbour for building or repairing small vessels, and a careening place along the quay, joining the slip. lights. \u2014 The time during which the entrance channel is practicable is made known at night by two vertical fixed white lights, dioptric and of the fourth order, placed outside the tower (with a fog bell and cross jack yard on its summit), built upon the S.W. jetty head ; and by a red light, catoptric and of the fourth order, exhibited from a white tower at 33 yards from the N.E. jetty head. The upper light on the S.W. jetty is 43 feet, and tho lower light 33 feet above the level of high-water springs, and both lights may be seen in clear weather at 9 miles. The red light on the N.E. jetty is 46 feet above the same level, and visible at 4 miles. The upper light on the S.W. jetty and the red light on the N.E. jetty are exhibited as soon as there are 9^ feet water on the sandy beach in front"], [151, "CHAP. III.] 135 FORT DE BOULOGNE.

Should there be several vessels running for the harbour, the signal is for the vessel nearest the entrance. If the sea is too heavy to enter the channel, they should bear up for Calais, for, as before stated, when Boulogne har bour is impracticable on account of the high sea, that of Calais can be entered, and the contrary. life boats. \u2014 There are three life boats stationed near the marine baths at Boulogne, furnished with every requisite for assisting vessels in danger, and several watchmen are constantly on duty. rade de Boulogne. \u2014 Good anchorage will be found in about 4| fathoms at low water, about three-quarters of a mile outside the pier heads at Boulogne, on a narrow strip of hard clay about 7 cables long, in a north and south direction, and a cable broad. This bottom is bounded on its west side by the rocky bottom called Vhuitriere or oyster bed, which begins at Cape Alprech and extends without interruption to the north ward as far as the parallel of Ambleteuse. The best anchorage, over good holding ground, is between the lines on which the colonnade of the new cathedral is seen in one with the guardhouse of Chatillon battery, which stands on the sand hills a little to the southward of the S.W. jetty; the fort on Mont Lambert in line with the belfry tower in the upper town; and S.W. \\ S. from the small fort at Ambleteuse. Vessels of moderate draught waiting tide for several days to enter Boulogne may remain at this anchorage during moderate winds, and even if caught there by a strong westerly wind, if they ride with a long scope of cable out ; those of large draught would be in danger of striking the bottom at low water.

Prom the Westward. \u2014 Vessels approaching Boulogne from the west ward, with the wind between South and West, should take the channel between the Bassure de Baas and the Vergoyer banks, and if they arrive at the time of low water on the parallel of Mont St. Frieux, short tacks should be made in the channel between that parallel and the line on which the column of the Grande-Armee is in line with the light tower on the S.W. jetty. If the wind is between South and East, the channel between the Bassure de Baas and the shore should be taken, and short boards made to the southward of the line of the column and the light tower in line, until the tide has risen; or if the weather will permit they can anchor in Boulogne road. Vessels of the largest draught may at all times cross over that part of the Bassure de Baas fronting Boulogne. One of the deepest spots lies with the column of the Grande-Armee in line with the light tower on the S.W. jetty bearing E. i N. They can also cross the bank from one third flood to two-thirds ebb at springs, between the parallels of Cape Alprech and Creche fort, and also at low water neaps. From the Northward. \u2014 With the wind between North and West, vessels bound to Boulogne from the northward should pass to the westward of the Bassure de Baas, and if the wind is fresh they can wait outside this bank until the time is favourable for entering; but with a light wind the bank should be crossed on the parallel of Creche fort, and a position maintained at a short distance to the windward of the entrance. If the wind is between North and East, it will be better to take the channel between the Bassure de Baas and the land, and anchor, if the weather permit, in a position so as to have the wind a point or two free for running into the entrance. The high land in the vicinity of Boulogne modifies the direction of the wind in the harbour, and sometimes when it is S.S.W. outside it is S. or S.S.E. within. Strong winds from the N.E. come off in violent squalls from the land to the northward of the harbour. A vessel should endeavour to enter the harbour during the last hour of the flood, which will assist her being tracked in. With a fresh leading wind, she may be able to stem the first hour of the ebb, and even the freshes of the river Liane, and get up to the berths at the stockade if she has a sufficient number of haulers to track her in. But whatever may be the strength and direction of the wind, all possible sail should be carried on entering the channel, to stem the eddy which runs between"], [153, "cnAP. in.] 137 PORT DE BOULOGNE ; DIRECTIONS. TIDES. the jetty heads as soon as the flood stream outside has attained its greatest strength, which is near the time of high water in the harbour. This eddy, after doubling the N.E. jetty head, divides into two parts, one part entering the channel, and the other crossing it rapidly towards the S.W. jetty head ; it must be guarded against when the wind is light, and when it blows out of the harbour a boat should be sent for the tracking rope. Generally speaking, when the wind is between West, round southerly, and N.E., steer close to the S.W. jetty head ; with a fresh wind from the opposite quarter, keep in mid channel ; and in light winds steer for the S.W. jetty to take in the tracking rope. Should the vessel with a strong S.W. wind miss the entrance, and there is no hope of clawing off the land, endeavour to pass close round the north side of the N.E. jetty, so as to run her ashore close to the jetty. If this occurs at half or three quarters of an hour after high water, there will be some chance of getting her afloat again, but at all events the crew will be saved. anchorage. \u2014 Vessels arriving off Boulogne during the neaps, and unable from their draught to go in, may, if the weather is fine, anchor in about 10 fathoms over good holding ground, at the eastern edge of the Bassure de Baas, abreast Vimereux. Should they be surprised here by strong N.E. winds, they can make for Ambleteuse road, or if a S.W. gale should oblige them to seek for refuge, they can either run for the Downs, or take shelter to leeward of the coast in the neighbourhood of Calais. tides and tidal signals. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in Port Boulogne at llh. 25 m., and the tide rises above the berths at the foot of the steam vessel quay, (which are 4 feet above the bottom of the entrance channel between the jetty heads, or 6J- feet above the level of the lowest tides,) 21 feet at ordinary springs, 23 feet at great springs, and 12i feet at the lowest neaps ; at ordinary neaps vessels of about 13 feet draught can be brought to the berths. Strong westerly winds raise the tide a foot or two higher, and those from the eastward have a contrary effect, but no greater rise than that given above should be allowed, as sometimes it will be necessary to cross a bar at the entrance. An allowance must also be made for the 'scend of the sea, which runs high at the entrance when it blows fresh from the westward. The tide is slack at high water springs for about 20 minutes with westerly, and 15 minutes with easterly winds, and vessels can be moved in the harbour during one hour and a half ; at neaps the slack continues about 40 minutes."], [154, "138 CAPE D'ANTIFF.R TO CAPE GRIS-NEZ. [chap. hi. At 3 miies to the westward of Boulogne, outside the Bassure de Baas, the flood stream begins to acquire its greatest strength at the time of high water in the harbour, maintains it for about 2 hours, and ceases at 3f hours after high water. At a short distance outside the jetty heads its greatest strength is at the time of high water in the harbour, and it ceases at 2| hours after that period. The eddies occasioned on the flood by the great projection of the S.W. jetty from the shore, are very strong as soon as the beach to the southward of the entrance is covered. These eddies extend into the bay to the northward of the N.E. jetty, and about the time of high water in the harbour they form a counter stream along the face of that jetty ; this stream runs to the N.W. and after rounding the jetty head divides into two parts, one of which enters the channel, whilst the other crosses it rapidly towards the S.W. jetty head.

At a cable's length to the N.W. of the steep cliff is the small fort of Creche, built on the rocks at the foot of the point. The coast continues steep for nearly a mile from Creche point, but from thence to Vimereux, it is bordered by high sand hills. At three quarters of a mile to the N.E. of Creche fort, and a quarter of a mile from the shore, is a small semicircular fort named Croi tower, with two tiers of guns, built upon the rocks at 50 feet above the level of the beach. From Vimereux to Oies point, which bears N.E. by N. 2 miles from Creche point, the coast is steep, but from thence to Audrecelles village, 2 miles farther to the northward, it is bordered by sand hills of middling height covered with verdure. At 1^ miles to the northward of Oies point is the village of Ambleteuse, built in the form of an amphi theatre on the northern side of Ambleteuse harbour, and, with the wind mill on the high ground to the northward of the village, may be easily recognised from the sea. Ambleteuse fort, like Croi tower, has two tier of guns. From Ambleteuse to the village of Audrecelles, the shore is formed of sand hills covered with bent grass and intersected by small rivulets, through which the sea runs in upon the land at high water. The village is built upon the shore, and defended by a small semicircular fort ; the"], [155, "chap, in.] POUT DE VIMEREUX.

From Audrecelles to the Eiden point, about 2 miles to the northward, the land adjoining the shore gradually rises, and forms a succession of hills, separated from each other by vallies, some of which run down to the coast ; but between the Riden point and Cape Gris-Nez, the land is more level and the cliff perpendicular, and being nearly as elevated as Cape Alprech, may be seen from 12 to 15 miles off. Between Ambleteuse and the rocks at Oies point, the beach is of sand, and dries out 3|r cables' lengths at low water ; but from Ambleteuse to the Riden point, its breadth decreases, and it is composed of rocks covered with sand. The coast from the Eiden point to Cape Gris-Nez is bordered by a rocky shelf, the projecting points of which do not extend beyond 1^ cables from the foot of the cliff's.

The har bour was excavated at the commencement of the present century at the mouth ofthe river Wimille, but a sudden fresh of that river having broken down the sluice gates, the channel was destroyed, the surf dispersed the stones which composed the jetties, and the sand and shingle of the beach to the southward filled up the harbour ; nothing now remains but a stockade of piles to which the vessels of the flotilla were fastened. The waters of the river still run through their former bed, and continue to follow the channel between the ruins of the jetties, but the bottom of the channel has risen so much that there are only about 10^ feet in it at springs, and 5 or 6 feet in the other parts of the harbour.

Vessels of large draught bound to the northern ports in the Channel, or to those of Calais or Dunkerque, await the spring tides in this road, if they arrive during the neaps with northerly winds, and it affords shelter in gales between N.E. round easterly, and South ; the sea is, however, very heavy here when it blows strong on a weather tide. The best anchoring ground is from the parallel of Vimereux to the line on which the church towers of Ambleteuse and Bazinghen are in one, bearing E. N., and a little in-shore of the rocky ground limiting the anchorage off Boulogne to the westward, and continues to the northward as far as the parallel of Ambleteuse. Large vessels, by not anchoring to the eastward of the line of the small tower of Le Eenard, (which stands a mile to the south-east of Portel,) in one with the hght tower on the S.W. jetty at Boulogne, S. f W., will be in a good position to weigh should it blow strong from the westward. A good berth for a vessel of large draught is to the N.W. by W. of Vimereux, with Le Renard tower open about a quarter of a point to the westward of the light tower on the S.W. jetty, in about 8 fathoms over hard muddy clay ; or in 9 fathoms over good holding ground of muddy sand, with the light tower and Le Renard tower in line, and Bazinghen church tower open a little to the northward of the Ambleteuse fort, E. N. Large merchant vessels can anchor in 7 fathoms over hard sand and broken shells on the latter bearing, and the column of the Grande-Armee in line with Croi fort. The space between the eastern edge of the Bassure de Baas and the rocky bottom which bounds the anchorage in Ambleteuse road is named the Parfondingue by the Boulogne pilots, who state that should line-of battle ships or frigates require to remain several days in the road, they would place them in that part of the Parfondingue between the line on which the column of the Grande-Armee is in one with the southern slope of Creche point, and the line on which Bazinghen tower is in one with Ambleteuse fort, and that here they would have sufficient room to weigh and round Cape Gris-Nez if it came on to blow strong from the S.W. ; or, if it shifted to the West or N.W. the crest of the bank would shelter them from the heavy sea.

This Cape, 167 feet high, is one of the most remarkable headlands on tbe northern coast of France, and is visible in clear weather at 14 or 15 miles ; from it the coast changes its direction abruptly to the eastward, and the precipitous rocky cliff, in which it terminates, as well as the cliffs to the southward and to the eastward, are of a dark grey colour and take a purple tint when lighted up by the sun. A lighthouse is built on the south-west extreme of a small spot of level land crowning the Cape, and some works of defence may be seen rising above the same level land, and a guard house at its extremity near the crest of the cliff. Large masses of rock lie at the foot of the Cape, and a rocky shelf partly covered with sand, dries at low water a quarter of a mile out from the cliffs ; the Cape should therefore be given a berth of at least 3 cables when rounding it at that time of tide. light. \u2014 The lighthouse on Cape Gris-Nez is erected a quarter of a mile to the southward of the Cape, at about half a cable from the edge of the cliff, and exhibits, at an elevation of 1 94 feet above high water, a white revolving light, the eclipses of which succeed each other every half minute. The light is dioptric, and of the first order, and visible in clear weather at 22 miles ; the eclipses are not total in ordinary weather within the distance of 12 miles.

Within a circuit of 2 miles around the Cape the streams run stronger than at a greater distance from the shore ; the flood beginning 2 hours before, and ending 3s hours after the time of high water at Boulogne, and running, when at its greatest strength, 4 knots at ordinary springs. Between the Ridge and the shore the flood stream runs with much greater strength than the ebb. The tidal streams in the northern part of the English Channel are of the same duration as in the bay of the Seine, the flood running about oh. 40m., and the ebb 6h. 50m. Towards the middle of the Channel the streams run straight through its length, until they have attained their greatest strength, when they follow the bends of the coasts to a distance of 7 miles in the offing. Within these limits, as soon as the flood stream begins to be felt, it turns towards the shore, but as its strength increases, it tends more to its principal direction, which is that which it follows when at its greatest strength, and which it retains for the greatest length of time ; when its rate begins to decrease, it turns off-shore and takes different directions till the end of the tide. The ebb stream runs with less velocity and undergoes the same change, but with this difference, that it directs itself towards every point of the compass. The rate of both streams increases in proportion to the narrowing of the Channel, and in the channels between the banks this rate is increased from half ebb to half flood. caution The deep elbow formed on the coast of France, between Capes Antifer and Gris-Nez, constrains the flood stream in fine weather to"], [159, "143 Chap, iii.] PAS DE CALAIS.

Tbe COAST from Cape Gris-Nez trends E. by N. 6 miles to Cape Blanc-Nez, and the intermediate land is high and may be seen in clear weather from 15 to 20 miles off; but beyond the latter Cape the shore bends more to the eastward, the high land turns in a south-east direction towards the interior, and a level plain extends from its foot to the coast, where it terminates in a low sandy shore bordered by ranges of sand hills, the highest of which are visible only 7 to 10 miles off. Between the Capes the shore forms a slight elbow, at the bottom of which is the village of Wissant, inhabited by fishermen. From about a mile to the eastward of Cape Gris-Nez, where the cliffs of that Cape terminate, to 1^ miles to the north-east of Wissant, where the steep cliffs recom mence, the coast is low and bordered by sand hills.* Cape Blanc-Nez owes its name to the high chalk cliff in which it termi nates. It forms no marked projection, but its position may be recognized from a good distance at sea by the guard-house built on the summit of the steep mound which crowns it, and which is the northern extremity of a range of hills joining Mont Couple. The last slopes of the high land forming the Cape, as well as the steep coast in which they terminate, extend ll miles to the eastward, nearly as far as the village of Sangatte, and it is at this village that the low sandy shore commences, which forms the remaining part of the French coast. The sand hills are low to within 1^ miles of Sangatte, but they gradually rise as they approach Calais, spreading into several parallel ranges to within 2 or 3 cables' lengths of the shore. The principal objects on this part of the coast are the windmills of Coquelles, which stand about 2 miles inland upon the last slopes of the range of hills extending to the eastward of Cape Blanc-Nez ; the wind mill at Bas or Nieulay, to the northward of these ; the buildings of the arm at Trouie or the Salines, situated about half-way between Sangatte * See Admiralty Charts, Dover Strait, No. 1,895 ; scale m=i an inch : North Sea, Sheet 1, No. 1,406 ; scale m=0. 3 of an inch : and North Coast of France, Sheet xiv, Boulogne to Dunkerque, No. 2,610; scale m = half an inch.

The beach in front of Sangatte is only a quarter of a mile wide at low water, but near the west jetty at Calais it dries out half a mile. Within a quarter of a mile of the beach there are several shoal patches of 7 and 8 feet, and no vessel should get amongst them at low tide. bamc a la X.IGNE The great prominence of Cape Gris-Nez, and the sudden change there in the direction of the coast, occasions an extensive eddy to the north-east of it during the flood. This eddy has no doubt caused the formation of this bank of sand and broken shells, which extends E.N.E. 4 miles from the Cape, and nearly 2 miles from the shore abreast Wissant. Its shoalest part uncovers at low water springs, and towards its north-east extreme several heaps of sand, named La Barriere, have been formed, upon the highest of which are only from 4 to 9 feet water ; the sea runs high upon them when it blows fresh on a weather tide. In 1857 the south-west end of the bank was found to be gradually joining itself to the Cape, leaving no longer a passage for fishing boats at low water ; a new passage, called the N.W. channel, is forming near the middle of the bank. les gardes.\u2014 The shore between Capes Gris-Nez and Blanc-Nez is bordered by a sandy beach, uncovering in some places 4 cables out at low water. In front of all the steep parts of the coast there are rocks rising from the sand, and amongst them and farthest from the shore are those named the Gardes, which uncover 7 feet at the lowest tides ; from their outer extreme Wissant church tower bears S.W. by S. 2 miles, and the guard-house on Cape Blanc-Nez E. by N. nearly 1^ miles. l.es quettocs and le rouge RIDEN*. \u2014 A rocky bottom, joining the shore and partly covered with sand, extends from the Gardes to Sangatte village, and 2 miles into the offing between the bearings of N.N.W. and E.N.E. of Cape Blanc-Nez, and its shoalest part forms two distinct dangerous flats of irregular rocks. The western flat, named the Quenocs, is about half a mile in diameter, and from its shoalest head of 7 feet the guard-house on Cape Blanc-Nez bears S. by E. E. about 1-J miles, and Sangatte church tower E. by S. f S. 2\\ miles. The second flat, named Rouge .Riden, is nearer the shore, and nearly a mile in extent from W.S.W. to E.N.E.; from its shoalest head of 7 feet the above guard-house bears South one mile.

The general depth on it varies from 5 to 8 fathoms, but when this coast was surveyed in 1836 three heaps of sand were found towards its centre, upon the shoalest parts of which were only 20 feet water. The Riden is dangerous at low water for vessels of large draught ; it also occasions strong eddies, and during fresh winds from the northward there is a heavy sea on it, and breakers in N.E. gales. les ridens de la rade, also named the Tetes, lie N.N.W. one mile from Calais pier-heads, and when this coast was surveyed in 1836, they con sisted of several heaps of sand, upon the highest of which were 4 fathoms at low water. Since that period they have been sensibly on the increase, and in 1857 there were only 2 fathoms over the highest head. Another head, with only \\\\ fathoms on it, and on which the fishing-boats sometimes ground, lies about half a mile to the N.E. of the extremity of the east jetty. A heavy sea runs upon them when the wind blows upon the shore. rade de Calais, comprised between the Riden de Calais and the beach to the westward of Calais harbour, affords anchorage with off shore winds to vessels that may arrive off the harbour a few hours before the tide will permit them to enter. A convenient position, in about 9 fathoms water and a mile from the shore, is with Sangatte church tower in line with the guard-house on Cape Blanc-Nez, W. by S. \\ S., and Calais lighthouse S.E. \\ E. At night keep Cape Gris-Nez light opening and shutting with the cliffs at Cape Blanc Nez, and anchor when Calais light bears S.E. \\ E. The road carries a depth of from 10 to 14 fathoms towards the Riden de Calais, and 7 to 9 fathoms at half a mile from the steep edge of the beach, over a sandy bottom mixed with broken shells ; but the pilots say that the anchors penetrate into a good holding ground beneath the sand, and that ships of the line and frigates have rode out a N.W. gale without driving under the southern part of the Riden. The holding ground is not so good near the shore. The road is sheltered by the land from W.S.W. round southerly, to S.E., but it is quite open to all other points of the compass. The Riden cannot be considered as a shelter, although the waves break with great violence during a northerly gale on its whole extent ; the sea, however, is much quieter here than in the offing, and a vessel with good ground tackling might ride out a gale in the northern part of the road. I. 2"], [164, "148 CAPE GRIS-NEZ TO DUNKERQUE. [chap. iv. port de Calais This port, the entrance to which is between two wooden jetties, consists of a tidal harbour and a small basin named Paradis, which dries at low water ; a floating basin under the ramparts of the citadel, in which the largest vessels that can enter the harbour lie afloat ; and a reservoir containing the scouring water. The entrance lies 11^ miles to the eastward of Cape Gris-Nez, S.E. \\ S. 22 miles from Dover, and S.E. f S. 20i miles from the South Foreland. Vessels of about 20 feet draught can enter the harbour at high- water ordinary springs, in fine weather when the sea is smooth, and of 15 feet at ordinary neaps ; but those seeking to enter during northerly winds, when the sea is not too high at the entrance, should not attempt it if they are above 17 feet at springs or above 12^ feet at neaps. The average depth on the bar at the lowest tides is about 5 feet, and 7 to 8 feet at the neaps, but it varies with the wind. With W.S.W. gales, which render the navigation of the English Channel so dangerous, the tide will rise a foot or two higher ; and it should be remembered that during springs, when it blows strong between West and South, and Boulogne is impracticable, Calais can be entered; on the contrary, when it blows hard between North and E.N.E., and it is impossible to enter Calais, Boulogne can be entered. Calais has some foreign and a brisk coasting trade, and the vessels belonging to the port are chiefly employed in the cod, herring, and mackerel fisheries. In 1856 the population was 11,966, and the amount of tonnage entered inwards was 227,099 tons. The imports were salt, colza oil, fish, coal, cordage, rails, cast iron, wood, woollens, cottons, machinery, &c. &c. ; the exports, wines, silks, Parisian goods, perfumery, &c. &c. There were also at that date 14 pilots, 5 pilot vessels, and 85 fishing vessels amounting to 2,380 tons, and manned by 510 men. The English and French mails pass by the route of Calais.* Life Boats. \u2014 There is a life preserving apparatus at Calais, and two life boats ; one stationed on the east, the other on the west side of the harbour. Tbe Entrance Channel is about 263 feet wide, and runs 6 cables' lengths in a S. by E. f E. direction from the entrance, between jetties lengthened out 807 feet by open pilework, which is crossed, as well as that part of the channel it encloses, by the flood and ebb streams. This arrangement prevents the sand from accumulating in front ofthe entrance, but it is a serious inconvenience to vessels entering or leaving at high water, as the stream outside is then running at its greatest strength. The Harhour begins where the east jetty joins the wall of the quay at the eastern part of the town. This wall continues along the whole length of the harbour, except where it is interrupted by the entrance to the Paradis basin, and by the sluice of the citadel ditch. The quays * See Admiralty Plan of Calais, No. 2,556 ; scale, m = 15 inches."], [165, "149 CHAP. IV.] PORT DE CALAIS. are spacious, their surface being 27 feet above low water. That part between the Paradis basin and the east jetty, named the Courgain or Colonne quay, is where vessels that arrive after high water, or those pre paring to quit the harbour, are placed, and about one half of the quay between the entrance to this basin and the citadel sluice is reserved for the mail and passage steamers ; the other half is given up to merchant vessels. There is a careening slip in the harbour, and a large crane, which may be used for masting. The Floating* Basin has a surface of 20,000 square yards, with 590 yards extent of quays. The entrance between the gates is 54 feet wide, and their sill is 3 feet 2 inches above the lowest tides. Both the harbour and floating basin are well sheltered from wind and sea; a swell, however, runs into the entrance channel, the harbour, and the Paradis basin, from half flood to half ebb when it blows strong from the northward, and vessels that are then alongside the Colonne quay strike heavily upon a hard shingle bottom. LIGHTS. \u2014 Calais lighthouse, octagonal and 167 feet high, stands in one of the angles of the fortifications at the north-east side of the town, and exhibits, at 190 feet above high water, a, fixed white light varied every four minutes by a bright flash, preceded and followed by short eclipses, which are not total in ordinary weather within 12 miles. The light is dioptric and of the first order, and visible in clear weather at 20 miles. A fixed ivhite tidal light, dioptric and of the fourth order, is shown from fort Rouge (which is built of wood upon piles to the westward of the west jetty), at lj cables' lengths S. -| E. of that jetty head. It is lighted when there are 8 feet water in the entrance channel, and extinguished when the tide has fallen to that depth, but it is not exhibited when the entrance is impracticable. The light is 33 feet above high water, and may be seen at 9 miles. * A fixed red light, elevated 16 feet, is shown at the extremity of the west jetty, and visible 2 miles off ; but it is essential to observe that during severe weather all access to this jetty head is sometimes cut off, when the lisht only at fort Rouge is shown, unless the entrance is deemed impracticable. A green light is shown from the end of the east pier when the entrance is safe and practicable for the mail packets to enter. directions.\u2014 As a general rule, Cape Blanc-Nez is the landfall that should be made when bound either to Calais, Gravelines, or Dunkerque. The most favourable winds for entering Calais hi rbour are those from W.S.W., round northerly, to East. When those that blow upon the coast are moderate, they only cause a heavy swell on the beach, but when they are strong they send in a heavy sea, and it is then dangerous to enter. Under these circumstances, which are frequent in winter,"], [166, "150 CAPE GRIS-NEZ TO DUNKERQUE. [chap. iv. vessels bound for the northern ports of France should immediately run for Boulogne. Vessels running for Calais from the south-west should, when on the parallel of Cape Gris-Nez and about a mile from it, steer about N.E. by E. J E., taking care not to bring the extremity of the Cape to the westward of S.W. by W. in order to keep outside the Barriere and the Quenocs rocks ; when Sangatte church tower is in line with the Coquelles windmills, bearing S.E. \u00a3 S., steer E.S.E. for the centre of Calais, until Audinghen church tower is hid behind the cliff at Cape Blanc-Nez, when, if there is water sufficient to enter the harbour, a course should be shaped for the entrance ; if not, an anchorage should be sought for in the southern part of Calais road. Small vessels may pass at all times of tide between the Quenocs and the Barriere, as well as between the Rouge Riden and the shore, by keeping Sangatte church tower in line with either of the three towers of Calais ; the largest vessels that the harbour will admit may also pass there from half flood to half ebb. At Night Cape Gris-Nez light should not be brought to the westward of S.W. by W. to avoid the Barriere and the Quenocs, and when Calais light bears E.S.E., steer E. by S.; then, if the ebb is running, anchor as soon as Cape Gris-Nez light is about to be hid behind the cliff at Cape Blanc-Nez ; but if the flood, and there is sufficient water at the entrance, steer for the light on fort Rouge, until the light is seen on the west jetty head, which must be rounded close to. From the Northward. \u2014 Vessels coming from the northward with a fresh fair wind, may, between a third flood and two-thirds ebb in Calais harbour, run either by day or night directly for the entrance over the Riden de Calais, as there is sufficient depth on that shoal at that time of tide. If late on the ebb, run on the meridian of Cape Blanc-Nez until Sangatte church tower is in line with the Coquelles windmills, S. E. \u00a3 S., then steer, if the weather is favourable, for the anchorage in the southern part of Calais road. At Night steer for Calais light on an E.S.E. bearing, until Cape Gris- Nez light bears W.S.W., then steer E. by S. until Cape Gris-Nez light is just hid behind Cape Blanc-Nez, when anchor, if the ebb is running, or if the flood, steer for the harbour. Entering the Harbour. \u2014 The most favourable time for entering Calais harbour, when the wind blows upon the coast, is at the moment of high water ; but with the wind abeam or ahead, at half or three-quarters of an hour before that period, so as to have time to be tracked up to the quays, or into the floating basin. It should, however, be borne in mind that during calm weather, at half a mile outside the entrance,"], [167, "CHAP. IV.] PORT DE CALAIS. 151 the flood stream continues to be felt 2\\ or 3 hours, and with strong westerly winds 4-\u00a3 and 5 hours after high water in the harbour, and it is at its greatest strength at the time of high water there. For this reason, whatever the direction of the wind, the end of the west jetty should be steered for, to avoid being set to the eastward of the entrance, and this precaution is particularly necessary when standing for the harbour on the starboard tack ; the bower anchors and a stern anchor should then be ready for letting go, and hawsers to run out in the event of being drifted on the east jetty. All sail should be carried, especially with the wind right aft, to stem the flood and to pass quickly through the swell at the entrance. Should a vessel with a strong westerly wind and without a pilot miss the entrance, she must anchor immediately, as near as possible to the end of the east jetty, and take in a pilot, whose assistance will then be indispensable. Vessels may get out of the harbour and gain an offing with a head wind, by making sail from the end of the west jetty on a weather tide. tides and TIDAL SIGNALS. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in Calais harbour at llh. 49m., and in 1836 the tides rose above the water in the entrance channel, 22 feet at ordinary springs, 23| feet at great springs, and 16 feet at ordinary neaps. The tides rise higher with strong winds from N.W. toW.S.W. than they do with those from East to S.S.E. From observations taken from 26th March to 7th April 1848 (full moon, 3rd April at 1 1 p.m.), the depth of water at the entrance, between the piers, at ordinary springs and neaps, was found to be as follows : \u2014 At high-water springs, 26 feet 3 inches ; at low water, 5 feet 7 inches : at high-water neaps, 23 feet ; at low water, 8 feet 10 inches. At quai de Maree alongside east jetty, at high-water springs, 31 feet 2 inches ; at low water, 10 feet 5 inches. At quai Commerce, at high- water springs, 22 feet 5 inches ; at low water, 1 foot 7 inches. The mean duration of the flood stream at springs in front of the entrance is 5-^ hours, and of the ebb 1\\ hours. At half a mile outside the piers the flood runs 2\\ or 3 hours after high water in the harbour, and with strong westerly winds, 4^ or 5 hours ; with easterly winds it continues only \\\\ or 2 hours. The rate of the flood at great springs is \\\\ knots. The slack at high-water springs continues about 20 minutes, and large vessels can be moved in the harbour during the space of \\\\ hours ; at neaps the time of slack often amounts to three-quarters of an hour. The tidal signals are hoisted on a mast and yard erected on fort Rouge, and are the same as those noticed in page 3, with this exception, that the flags are hoisted when there are 8 feet water at the jetty heads, instead of 6^ feet, and lowered as soon as the water has fallen to that level."], [168, "152 [chap. iv. CAPE GRIS-NEZ TO DUNKERQUE. BANKS off the NORTH COAST of FRANCE. \u2014 The approach to this low, dangerous coast is obstructed by numerous banks, composed of grey and black sand, which extend as far as 15 miles from the shore on the meridian of Calais, and 42 miles in a N.E. direction from Dunkerque. Their shoalest spots may be touched upon by vessels of almost any draught, and the eddies they occasion cause a hollow sea, and the waves break upon them when it blows strong. Those farthest from the land lie on the eastern limit of tho 20 fathoms soundings at low water, which form in the southern part of the North Sea, the deep, known as the deep-soundings channel, which begins at Dover strait, and ends at about lat. 53\u00b0 20' N. The banks are all steep to on their inshore edge, and spread in a gentle slope towards the offing, and as they rise from the submarine bank, com posed of sand, gravel, and broken shells, joining the shore, and upon which there are less than 20 fathoms at low water, a simple method is afforded to avoid getting amongst them by not going into less than that depth at that time of tide. The lights at Cape Gris-Nez and Calais arc in a good position to point out at night their western limit ; and the revolving light at Dunkerque, seen in clear weather at 24 miles, will give notice of ap proach to a greater part of them. The dangers in the navigation along the shore can only be avoided by placing the vessel under charge of a good pilot ; but generally speaking, none of the banks should be ap proached except a vessel is bound for one of the harbours on the coast. These banks are divided into two groups; the first and nearest the shore are named the Dunkerque banks, and the others are those lying at some distance from the coast, the existence and position of which were not well known until the late Captain W. Hewett, R.N., surveyed them in H.M.S. Fairy between 1831-1840. dunxesque banks, eleven in number, extend 15 miles from the coast between the meridians of Calais and the frontier of Belgium. Their names are, the Sandettie ; the Out Ruytingen ; the In Ruytingen ; the Bergues ; the Dyck, the north-east part of whicli is called the Clif dTslande or East Clif ; the In Ratel ; the Out Ratel ; the Haut-fond de Gravelines ; the Breeds ; the Smal ; and the bank which bounds Dunkerque road to the northward, and which is composed of several parts united together, named, Snouw, Braeck, Hils, and Traepegeer. The other banks, six in number, lying to the northward of the Dunkerque banks, are, the Fairy ; the North Hinder ; the West Hinder ; the East Hinder ; the Bligh ; and the Thornton Ridge. saubetthb, (in Flemish the Zand-detie, called also the Ourting Tby the mariners on this coast), the most western of the Dunkerque banks, is about 12 miles long, in an E. by N. and W. by S. direction,"], [169, "chap, iv] DUNKERQUE BANKS; SANDETTIE.

Its south and south-east edges are steep to, having from 19 to 20 fathoms water at less than half a cable's length from the southern edge, but its slope is more gradual towards the north west, and this side may easily be avoided by the lead. Tliere are two shallow flats on this bank, over whicli it would be dan gerous to pass in bad weather. The northern flat, with only 21 feet water on it, lies N.N.W. | W. 18 miles from Dunkerque lighthouse, and N.E. | N. from that at Calais ; and the southern flat, on which there are only 20 feet, lies W. by S. 3^ miles from the northern flat, N.W. -\\ N. from Dunkerque lighthouse, and N.N.E. \\ E. from that at Calais, Besides these flats, there are other heaps of sand, with from 21 to 25 feet on them, spreading 1\\ miles in a W. by S. direction from the southern flat ; but the depths vary from 31 to 46 feet upon the other parts of the bank. The Sandettie, rising suddenly from the bottom, causes strong ripplings and when it blows fresh the sea is heavy around it, and breaks upon the shoal flats. From the south-west end of the bank, which is steep to, in 8 fathoms at low water, the following lights maybe seen in clear weather: \u2014 Cape Gris-Nez, S.W. A W. 21 miles ; Calais, S. by W. 1 W. 13 miles ; Gravelines, S.S.E. \u00a3 E. 15 miles ; Duukerque, S.E. J- E., just visible ; and South Foreland lights, W. by N. \\ N. 17 miles. In the daytime, if the weather is clear, the summit of Mont Couple may be recognized, S.W. by S. distant 19 miles ; also, the South Foreland, and the white cliffs near Dover, bearing W. by N. The north-east end of the Sandettie; upon which there are 8^ fathoms at low water, lies N. by W. \u00a7 W. 18 miles from Dunkerque light ; but Gravelines light is too far distant to be seen in ordinary weather. out ruytingen, lying midway between the coast of France and the Sandettie, is separated from the latter by a channel 6 miles wide, with soundings of from 14 to 21 fathoms in it. Its western end begins at about 7 miles from the shore on the meridian of Calais lighthouse, and from thence it extends 7 miles to the eastward, and then curves 9 miles to the E.N.E., terminating at 12 miles N.

The Out Ruytingen occasions strong eddies, and the sea which breaks upon its shoalest parts when it blows fresh is also heavy upon its edges. There are some irregularities of the bottom, with 6 to 9 fathoms on them, to the westward of this bank, as far as N. by W. from Calais, and small vessels should avoid crossing them in bad weather. in ruytingen lies 2\\ miles to the eastward of the Out Ruy tingen, and including all the shoal soundings of less than 8-^ fathoms, it is 8 miles long, W.S.W. to E.N.E., and 3 miles broad, S.S.E. to N.N.W. From its western extreme Dunkerque lighthouse bears S. by E. E. 9| miles, and S. by W. \u00a7 W. 12^ miles from its north-eastern extreme. The In Ruytingen is of a triangular form, and the irregularity of the depths on it cause an uneasy sea. Those parts on which there are less than 26 feet water form two flats, separated from each other by soundings of from 5 to 6 fathoms. The western flat, which occupies the centre .of the bank, is 2 miles long from north to south, and 11 miles wide, with as little as 9 feet on it, which depth lies with Dunkerque lighthouse seen midway between Cassel and the spires at Bergues bearing S. }_\u25a0 E. The eastern flat lies on the north-east part of the bank, and is 1^ miles long, and its shoalest spot has 14 feet on it.

WEST DYCK, middle dyck, and east dyck form one continued narrow shoal, the several banks on which are separated by soundings of less than 6 fathoms at low water. The south-west end of this shoal commences N.E. \u00a3 N. 6 miles from Calais lighthouse, and from thence runs to the eastward parallel to the coast for 18 miles, or as far as the meridian of Dunkerque, and then trends E.N.E. 13 miles. That part which lies between its western extreme and the meridian of Gravelines is named the West Dyck or Orteil ; the centre part, between Gravelines and Grande Synthe, the Middle or real Dyck ; and the eastern part is gene rally known as the East Dyck, or Clif-dTslande. \u2022west Dyck is 9 miles in length, and its greatest breadth is about half a mile. From the least depth, of 16 feet, on it, Gravelines lighthouse bears S- -^ W. 5^ miles. To the distance of 21 miles east and west of this shoal spot the depths are from 19 to 27 feet, and towards the western extremity of the bank, N.E. E. from Calais lighthouse, a small patch has been found with 27 feet on it. Small vessels should avoid passing near some patches of 7 and 8 fathoms, which lengthen out this bank to the westward nearly as far as the meridian of Calais, as there is a con fused sea on their edges when it blows fresh on a weather tide. Middle Dyck is one continued flat, 6 miles long in an E. by N. and W. by S. direction, and 6 cables broad, and carries from one to 6 fathoms on it at low water. It commences N.N.E. | E. 6 miles from Gravelines lighthouse, and ends N. \\ W. 7 miles from that at Dunkerque. The shoalest part of this flat is 3^- miles long, and covered with heaps of sand upon which the depths vary from 5 to 9 feet. The centre of the largest heap, lying 1^ miles from the eastern end of the flat and N. by W. | W. from Dunkerque lighthouse, is extremely dangerous, being steep- to on all sides, but especially towards the north-west, where at 2 cables distance there are from 18 to 19 fathoms water. East Dyck or Clif-dTslande is separated from the Middle Dyck by a channel about a mile wide, in which the depth is about 5 fathoms. The south-west end of this bank lies N. t, E. 7 miles from Dunkerque lighthouse, and from thence it trends N.E. by E. 14 miles. It is very dangerous throughout its whole extent, as it rises abruptly like a wall from soundings of from 11 to 17 fathoms. Its shoalest part, which is a flat 2 miles long, and upon which there are only from 6 to 9 feet water, commences on the south-west end of the bank, and extends to the north-east as far as the meridian of the lighthouse.

The north-east end of this bank, where the depths are only from 3 to 4 fathoms, and around which the sea is always disturbed, is a formidable danger, as it rises abruptly from soundings of 15 and 17 fathoms, and therefore difficult to be avoided by the lead, however quickly it may be hove. The shoal spot of 3 fathoms lies N.E. \\ N. 19 \"miles from Dun kerque lighthouse, but as this end of the bank is so far from the land, the most remarkable objects cannot be recognized, even from the mast-head, unless the weather is very clear; Dunkerque light may, however, be seen 5 or 6 miles farther off in clear weather. zn-ratel. \u2014 This bank is, properly speaking, only a branch of the Middle Dyck, to the south-west end of which it is joined by a narrow sandy ridge, which has gradually risen since 1802.

From this dangerous spot of one foot Dunkerque lighthouse bears S. f E. 6 miles. The channel separating the In-Ratel from the Breedt is barred between the western flats on these banks by a heap of sand, upon which there are only 18 feet water. There are 12 and 13 fathoms in this channel at a short distance east and west ofthe bar. out-ratel is an isolated bank, about a mile wide, lying to the south-east and parallel to the East Dyck, from which it is separated by a deep channel 2\\ miles wide. Its name, meaning rattle, is perhaps derived from the noise of the heavy sea which runs upon it in bad weather. Near its south-west end, lying about a mile to the north ward of the east end of the Breedt, is a dangerous flat, with only 8 feet water on it. This shoal spot lies N.E. \\ N., 10 miles from Dunkerque lighthouse, and from thence the bank extends N.E. by E. \\ E.

The Out-Ratel, having many dangerous flats on it, ought not to be crossed, even by small vessels, without using great prudence. It is separated from the East Dyck, as well as from the eastern end of the Breedt, by soundings of from 8 to 12 fathoms. A small bank, with only 25 feet on it, lies N.N.W. \u00a3 W. 1^ miles from its north east end, and is separated from it by soundings of 10 to 13 fathoms.

The southern part of this bank bounds Nieuport road to the north, and is extremely steep-to N.N.E. of Sables tower. A dangerous flat, about 8i miles long and carrying only from 4 to 9 feet water, rises from the Smal bank, commencing N.E. by N. 2\\ miles from Dunkerque lighthouse, and extending without interruption as far as N. \\ W. from Furnes. It is joined to the flat on Hils bank by shoal water, of from 3 to 16 feet, the centre of which lies with Dunkerque tower seen just open to the eastward of Leuguenaerd tower. Between the east end ofthe flat and the north-east extreme of the bank are several isolated patches, upon which there are only 10 to 16 feet water. The Smal bank is joined to Nieuport bank by a narrow bar, with from 17 to 22 feet on it at low water, lying 3^ miles from the shore in aN.-} W. direction from Furnes.

The Braeck is steep to, its sides rising from the bottom like a wall, and with winds from the northward the sea breaks upon it with great fury. Its south-west end has increased considerably since its highest parts have united with those of the Snouw, and this end is now connected with the shallow flats joining the shore, by a sandy shoal running to the W.S.W., and forming a sort of bar across the West Pass to Dunkerque road, upon which there are from 29 to 33 feet at low water."], [175, "3HAP.

The only objects that can be recognized on the level land adjoining the shore are, the two wind mills at Walde, the spire of Oye church, and two windmills standing near Oye village. At low water the sandy beach extends more than a mile from the shore between Calais and the meridian of the Walde windmills, as well as off the entrance to Gravelines; but along the intermediate coast its breadth varies from half to three-quarters of a mile.

The principal articles of trade are, wine, brandy, gin, salt, timber, salt fish, refined sugar, beer, &c. Vessels are fitted out for the herring, cod, and mackerel fisheries. This harbour is only accessible to vessels of 14 feet draught at the utmost at high water springs. At weak springs those of ll1: feet can enter it during 5 or 6 days, that is, 2 or 3 days before full and change, and 3 days after. It affords good shelter at the springs to vessels ofabout 12 feet draught during gales from the westward, and especially those between W.S.W. and W.N.W., when the sea is not heavy at the entrance; but the bar should be crossed at the time of high water. In a gale from E.N.E. to East they should run in with the flood, for after high water there will be some difficulty in stemming the ebb. The tide rises much higher with strong northerly winds, but as the sea is then very high at the entrance, no vessel drawing more than 12 feet should attempt to enter, unless she is embayed, and there is an impossibility of reaching the anchorage in Dunkerque road, which is the only place on this coast where, with those winds, a vessel could find a little shelter. pilots cannot get out to vessels when the sea is high on the bar, but they wave a flag in the direction they should steer. A red flag is hoisted on a staff erected on the shore at the commence ment of the west jetty during the time the entrance is practicable, and kept up as long as there is sufficient water for the fishing vessels. The channel, leading into this harbour, runs S. by E. \\ E. 2 miles in a direct line from the entrance, and consists of two distinct parts, one bounded by the beach, and the other by the land between the village of Fort Phillippe and Gravelines. The outer part of the channel, 8 cables long and 305 feet wide at the entrance, is enclosed between two low stone jetties, which, for half their length from the shore, are not covered during the neaps. The end of the west jetty is 18 feet above the lowest tides, and is marked by a large wooden beacon carrying a weathercock ; the extremity of the east jetty is 15 feet above the same level, and M 2"], [180, "164 [chap.

Both jetties bave beacons on their whole length secured by strong woodwork, by means of which vessels warp in. Abreast the extremity of the east jetty, the level of the fresh water which runs out of the harbour when the tide is out, is 3 feet above the level of low water great springs. The inner part of the channel between the village of Fort Phillippe and the harbour is a little better than a mile long, and half a cable broad, and is enclosed between two embankments, which serve for towing-paths. The mud deposited in the channel forms a steep slope on either side. The Harbour is situated on the north-west side of the town, at the mouth of the river Aa, the abundant freshes of which during rain and the melting of the snow, clear both it and the entrance channel of the mud and sand which accumulate there in dry weather. It is about lj cables long, and occupies about half the breadth of the channel by which the course of the Aa has been straightened between the ditches of the western part of the fortifications and the entrance channel. The berths of muddy sand, upon which vessels are placed alongside the stone quay bordering the whole length of the harbour on the town side, are 4^ feet above the level of low water great springs. The swell from outside never reaches the harbour. Bar. \u2014 The entrance to the channel leading to the harbour is frequently obstructed by a bar formed of the sand driven by westerly winds and the sea from the beach to the westward. The height and extent of this bar depend upon the duration of these winds, as well as upon the body of fresh water out of the harbour. At its medium state it is from 2 to 3 feet above the level of the fresh water running through the channel when the tide is out, or 5 or 6 feet above the level of the lowest tides. It sometimes disappears for several days during the great freshes of the river Aa, when there is a strong N.E. wind. lights. \u2014 Gravelines lighthouse, of a light red colour and resembling a Doric column, stands at the eastern side of the entrance, in the west part of the village of Little Fort Phillippe, at 175 yards from the shore, and 65 yards from that eastern bank of the entrance channel. It exhibits, at 95 feet above high water, a fixed white light, dioptric and of the third order, visible at 15 miles. Two fixed white tide lights, 196 feet apart and each 20 feet above high water, are shown on the shore at the village of Great Fort Phillippe, at the commencement of the west jetty, from 2 hours before till 2 hours after high water, and when in one they point out the direction of the entrance."], [181, "165 CHAP. IV.] PORT DE GRAVELINES ; DIRECTIONS. TIDES. Both lights are catoptric and of the sixth order, and may be seen at 6 miles. directons. \u2014 Vessels arriving off Gravelines harbour sometime before the tide serves to enter, may anchor north of Oye church spire, at 1^- or 2 miles from the shore, in from 5 to 8 fathoms, over excellent holding ground. This anchorage, however, is only safe for a few hours during fine weather, for the sea is heavy there when the wind blows upon the shore. The most favourable winds for entering the harbour are those from N.N.W., round northerly, to N.E., but when they blow fresh they cause a high sea at the entrance, and it will then be necessary to be quite certain there is sufficient water over the bar without danger of striking. With fresh winds from W.S.W. to W.N.W. the sea is smooth on the bar, but there is then a difficulty in getting through the entrance channel when the low jetties are covered, for the flood stream, and the sea crossing it, may drift a vessel upon the east jetty. The entrance is. easy with N.E. winds, when they are sufficiently strong to stem the flood, which is at its greatest strength when it is high water in the harbour. With a head wind, a vessel is tracked in and placed on the ground in the inner part of the channel. The best time for entering the harbour is about an hour before high water ; but as the stream at that time runs strong across the entrance, there will be some difficulty in keeping in the deepest parts of the channel ; if the vessel, however, takes the ground she may float again before the tide has done rising. The bowers and a stern anchor must be ready to let go, and hawsers to run out should she be drifted upon the east jetty. Sufficient sail should also be carried to ensure good steerage, especially during the autumn and winter months, when it may blow fresh in the offing whilst the breeze is light near the shore, which circumstance would place a vessel in considerable danger in the great swell on the bar. In entering the channel with westerly winds, whatever may be their strength, and also with light easterly winds, pass close to the northward of the outer West beacon ; with fresh easterly winds pass either close to the northward of the outer East beacon, or run directly for the middle of the entrance. tides and tidal szghax.s. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in Gravelines harbour at midnight, and the tide rises (above the level of the fresh water which runs out of the harbour when tha tide is out, and wliich is about 3 feet above the level of the lowest tides,) 18 feet at ordinary springs, 19J to 20-ij feet at great springs, and 11| to 13| feet at ordinary neaps. By deducting 2 feet from these heights, the rise of water"], [182, "166 [chap. iv. CAPE GRIS-NEZ TO DUNKERQUE. on the bar, supposing it to be in its medium state, will be found. Strong winds from N.W. to N.N.W. cause the tide to rise higher, and those from S.E. have a contrary effect. The tide rises slowly for the first three hours, but its rise is rapid from the third to the fourth hour ; it then slacks gradually till high water. At springs the highwater slack in the harbour continues about 15 minutes in calm weather, 20 to 25 minutes with westerly winds, and 10 minutes at the utmost with off-shore winds ; but as there is little rise or fall for the last half hour flood and the first half hour ebb, there is a period of nearly l-\u00a3 hours for moving vessels in and out without danger of grounding. The new system of tidal signals, noticed in page 3, is used at this port. aspect os coast. \u2014 The low plain behind the shore between Grave lines and Dunkerque presents no remarkable objects visible at sea ; the only high land that can be seen in clear weather are two isolated hills, named Great and Little Cassel, rising S. W. from Dunkerque. The town of Cassel stands on the summit of the largest, and the other hill is in the form of a cone. The buildings that may be recognized on the coast are, the tower and lighthouse at Dunkerque, and the church towers of Grande and Petite Synthe and Mardick. Gravelines point, bearing E. by N. 3| miles from Gravelines lighthouse, is of a rounded form and the sand hills composing it lie in several parallel ridges and are visible in clear weather at 9 or 10 miles. A chain of sand hills covered with verdure extends 2 miles in a W.S.W. direction from the point. The sand hills bordering tbe shore for about 2 miles to the eastward of Gravelines point are about the same height as those at the point, but beyond this, and to within a short distance of Dunkerque, they are covered with bent grass, and lie in parallel ridges at half a mile in the rear of an embankment, fronted by low land, which is covered at spring tides. Between the entrance of Gravelines and Gravelines point the beach dries out half a mile at the springs ; abreast the point it dries 3 cables, and between the point and Dunkerque 6 or 7 cables' lengths. The sand which is carried to the eastward by strong westerly winds is arrested by the jetties at Dunkerque, and accumulates on the beach between Mardick and Dunkerque, where it forms an immense heap, the highest parts of which are barely covered at the springs. Of all the obstacles which oppose themselves to the improvement of Dunkerque, this high beach is the most difficult to overcome, for the sand from it is forced over the west jetty, and forms a bank several feet high at the end of the jetty and across the entrance. The soundings off this part of the coast, within the depth of 5 fathoms, are very irregular, and the sea is heavy when the winds blow on the shore."], [183, "CHAP. IV.] RADE DE DUNKERQUE ; PASSE DE l'oUEST. 167 Between the entrance to Gravelines and Gravelines point these soundings extend 2 miles from the shore, and amongst them lies a deep, named Fosse de Mardick, which, although carrying from 26 to 29 feet water, should always be avoided. This deep is separated from the West Pass leading to Dunkerque road by the eastern end of a shoal, with 11 to 19 feet over it, which extends to the westward as far as the meridian of Gravelines lighthouse. Another shoal, the edge of which is steep to, joins the beach between Mardick and Dunkerque, and extending lj miles from the shore forms the southern boundary of the West Pass ; its western end lies N.W. by N. of Mardick church tower. passe de i'ouest, or West Pass into Dunkerque road, is about 4 miles long, and lies between the shoal flats joining the shore and the Snouw bank. The entrance to it, as well as the direction it follows, is marked by the following buoys : \u2014 A striped red and black buoy is moored at the western extremity of the Snouw at the entrance of the Pass, and must be left on the port hand in entering. The northern edge of the Pass, as well as the most dangerous parts of the steep edge of the Braeck bank, are marked by the three black following buoys with staffs, which must also be left on the port hand in entering : \u2014 Black buoy No. 1 is moored at the western extremity of the steep high flat of the Snouw, S.E. by E. about a mile from the striped red and black buoy. Black buoy No. 3 is moored in 15 feet water, 2\\ miles farther to the eastward on the western edge of the Braeck bank ; but a narrow part of this bank, with 17 to 19 feet on it at low water, extends three quarters of a mile to the westward of the buoy, and is dangerous to vessels of large draught running into Dunkerque road with a strong westerly wind at low water. Black buoy No. 5 is moored in 20 feet water upon the southern edge of the Braeck bank, about a mile to the eastward of Black buoy No. 3. The southern edge of the West Pass, as well as the southern limit of the western part of Dunkerque road, are marked by three red buoys moored upon the outer edge of the dangerous flats joining the shore as follows : \u2014 Red buoy No. 2 lies N.W. by N. from Mardick church tower and S.S.E. 6 cables' lengths from black buoy No. 1. It is necessary to see this buoy either when entering or leaving the Pass. A pilot vessel generally lies at anchor near it. Red buoy No. 4 lies on the edge of the 16 feet soundings joining the beach, E. by S. \u00a3 S. 2 miles from Red buoy No. 2, N.N.E. f E. from"], [184, "168 [chap. iv. CAPE GRIS-NEZ TO DUNKERQUE.

Red buoy No. 6 lies about 1 J miles to the eastward of red buoy No. 4, upon the edge of the same 16 feet soundings, N.E. by E. \u00a3 E. from Mar dick church tower, and S. f W. half a mile from black buoy No. 5. The northern limit of the eastern part of Dunkerque road is marked by two red buoys with staffs. The western red buoy, No. 8, is moored on the southern edge of the Braeck bank, N. by E. f E. from the entrance to Dunkerque. The eastern red buoy, No. 6, lies upon the southern edge of Hils bank, E. J S. 2J miles from Red buoy No. 8. passe de zuydcoote, or East Pass into Dunkerque road, runs in a N.E. J E. and S. W. J W. direction between Hils and Traepegeer banks, and carries 17 to 24 feet at low water ; its limits are marked by one black and two red buoys. The southern red buoy with staff, No. 4, marks the south-east edge of Hils bank ; the northern red buoy with staff, No. 2, the north-east edge ; and the black buoy, No. 1, the north west edge of the Traepegeer. It is necessary to observe that the red buoys upon the eastern slope of Hils bank, which is very steep, sometimes drift and cross the Zuydcoote Pass to the western slope of the Traepegeer ; this frequently happens to red buoy, No. 4. directions. \u2014 Vessels running for Dunkerque road, either by the West or by the Zuydcoote Pass, must leave all buoys and beacons painted red to starboard, and all painted black to port. When the flood stream begins to be felt in Dunkerque road, which is about the time of half flood in the harbour, the tide has risen 9 feet in the Zuydcoote Pass, and the largest vessels that can enter Dunkerque may at that time pass over the south-west end of the Traepegeer by keeping the spires of Bergues church open about a degree to the westward of Leffrinckoucke church tower bearing about S.W. by S. If a vessel's draught will permit her to turn through the Zuydcoote Pass between half flood and half ebb, the lead must be hove quickly to avoid coming suddenly upon Hils bank ; and in standing to the eastward she should not open the spires of Bergues more than two degrees to the east ward of Leffrinckoucke church tower. In thick weather, should the spires not be visible, she may run through this Pass, if Sables tower is seen, by steering for it on a S. by W. f W. bearing. Vessels leaving Dunkerque road by the Zuydcoote Pass will cross the western part of Nieuport road, where there is excellent holding ground, with from 5 to 9 fathoms water.

At Night vessels of less than 11 feet draught wishing to enter Dun kerque road by the Zuydcoote Pass, and unable to distinguish the colour of the first buoy they obtain sight of, cannot do wrong by steering close to the eastward of it, for there is sufficient water for them as far as 4 cables' lengths to the eastward of black buoy No. 1 on the north-west edge of the Traepegeer, and if it is red buoy No. 2, on the north-east edge of Hils bank, they will by steering to the eastward of it be in the middle of the Pass. Black buoy No. 1 is moored E.N.E. J E. 6J miles from Dunkerque lighthouse, and it very rarely drifts from its position. rade de dunkerque, being narrow, and only sheltered by banks always covered, must only be considered as a temporary anchorage for vessels whose draught will permit them to enter the harbour ; it might however, in a case of necessity, afford shelter to ships of the line. Sharp vessels deeply laden will be in some danger from the heavy sea, but with this exception the pilots consider that with good ground tackling a vessel might ride out a gale from the offing. The road is comprised between the outer edge of the 5 fathoms soundings joining the shore, and the Braeck, the Hils, and the Trae pegeer banks. It extends from the western end of the shallow flat on the Braeck, N. E. of Mardick tower, to the entrance of the Zuyd coote Pass, and is separated into two deeps by a sandy bottom 3 cables wide, the centre of which lies N.N.W. 1 W. from Dunkerque lighthouse. There are 5 to 8 fathoms on this sandy bottom; but the holding ground is bad in the deepest water. A pilot vessel generally lies at the entrance of the West Pass, not far from red buoy No. 2. The western of these deeps, in which the soundings are from 8 to 9 fathoms, good holding ground, commences N.E. of Mardick tower, and extends to the sandy bottom just mentioned, and is in some degree sheltered from the high sea during northerly gales by the high flat on the Braeck bank. It is in this part of the road that vessels of large draught anchor with westerly winds and a heavy sea, when they have to wait several hours for high water to enter Dunkerque. Small vessels under similar circumstances can anchor N.W. about a mile from the entrance of the harbour, in the southern part of the sandy bottom, as the holding ground there is good and the depths from 5 to 7 fathoms : this is also a good position for all vessels with off-shore winds. The eastern deep commences with Heuguenar tower in line with Dunkerque lighthouse, and extends to the Zuydcoote Pass ; the depths iu"], [186, "170 [chap. IV. CAPE GRIS-NEZ TO DUNKERQUE. it vary from 8 to 1 1 fathoms, and the holding ground is good, particularly N.N.E. of Dunkerque. Large vessels requiring to remain some time in Dunkerque road, should anchor in this deep between the lines on which Heuguenar tower is seen touching the eastern side of the lighthouse, and the same tower in one with Dunkerque tower, where they will be better sheltered than in the western deep, against the heavy sea during gales from N.N.W., round northerly, to E.N.E. by the high flats on Braeck and Hils bank, and in the event of their parting it will be much less dangerous for them to run ashore to the eastward than to the westward of Dunkerque. A vessel at anchor in any part of the road should have a spare anchor ready to let go as soon as the wind veers and threatens to blow from the northward. tides. \u2014 The first of the flood stream in Dunkerque road comes from the N.N.W. ; as it gains strength its direction is more to the eastward and at its greatest speed, which lasts about 2 hours, it runs straight through the road. It then decreases rapidly, and after a few minutes slack water the ebb stream commences, which runs first to the N.N.W., and as its rate increases it turns to the westward ; when at its greatest strength it runs parallel with the coast, and towards the end of the tide its direction is W. S.W. and S.S.W. port de dunkerque, situated 10 miles to the eastward of Grave lines, is both a naval and commercial port, and the principal French port in the North Sea. The town stands at the junction of the Bergues, Bourbourg, and Furnes canals, and the public buildings are spacious, handsome, and regular ; as this port serves as an outlet for the great manufacturing departement du Nord, the trade by sea is considerable, and the cod and herring fisheries are carried on with great activity. The population in 1856 amounted to about 30,000. The principal articles imported in 1856 were flour, cotton, wool, gin, flax, machinery, sugar, salt, oleaginous seeds, coal, pig iron, lead, iron, potash, sulphur, vegetable oils, and tallow ; and the total amount of customs revenue was 304,024/. In 1854 the number of vessels entered inwards was 2,019 ; and 1,980 cleared outwards. The number of merchant seamen belonging to the port at the beginning of 1856 was 1,419, and the number of sailing vessels 428, of which 30, from ] 00 to 600 tons, were engaged in the foreign trade; 176, from 10 to 300 tons, in the coastino* trade, of which 95 were engaged in the Iceland cod fisheries ; 112, under 100 tons, in minor fisheries ; and 110 were unemployed. The number of steam vessels at the same period was five, of which four, of from 50 to 200 horse-power, were in the coasting trade, and the other was unemployed"], [187, "CHAI'. IV.] PORT DE DUNKERQUE. 171 Between the years 1853 and 1856 the British trade had nearly doubled, and in the latter year 728 vessels, of 86,784 tons, entered inwards. The port consists of an entrance channel leading to an outer tidal har bour, at the end of which is an inner tidal harbour and a floating basin. The inner harbour, together with the floating basin and the buddings around it, belong to the Government, and form what is called the Naval Arsenal. At present there is no patent slip. Vessels drawing 19 feet can enter the port at high water during three or four days after full and change, and advance as far as the eastern jetty, where they can be lightened ; if drawing 18 feet, they can proceed as far as the first stone quays, where the cargo can be discharged ; and if of 17 feet draught, they can enter the floating basin. During three or four days after each quarter about 4 feet must be deducted from the above depths. When the extensive works now in progress are finished, there will be an augmentation of 3 feet to all the depths above mentioned. At low water there are only 3 feet at springs and 6 feet at neaps in the entrance channel. Considered as a place of shelter, the port will admit vessels of about 16 or 17 feet draught at high-water ordinary springs, during strong winds between N.W., round westerly, and W.S.W. ; 18 feet at great springs ; and 12 feet at neaps. Northerly gales cause such a high sea outside the jetties that those of above 14 feet draught should not attempt to run in at that time without the pilots judge the entrance practicable ; small vessels may enter at the top of high water by carrying all possible sail to get through the high sea, but the entrance is inaccessible during these gales at the neaps to all except coasters. The Entrance Channel, which is about a mile long in a N.N.W. and S.S.E. direction, and 230 feet wide, is enclosed partly by the citadel quay and the extension of the town quay as far as the Cunette sluice, and partly between wooden jetties. The sand forces itself into the channel by the openings between the pilework and through the entrance, particularly during dry weather and at the neaps. A portion of water from the canals in the interior, as well as that from the ditches of the town, is used to scour out the harbour and the entrance channel, but although the stream is rapid, it has such a distance to run that its effect does not extend far beyond the jetty heads. During the rainy season, and at the melting of the snow, when the water in the iuterior is abundant, the stream runs stronsr out of the channel all the time the flood is weak, and is checked only when the tide rises rapidly, but it recovers its course as soon as the tide slacks, which is about half an hour before high water, and as soon as the ebb makes it acquires great speed. This stream is but little incon-"], [188, "172 [chap. iv. CAPE GRIS-NEZ TO DUNKERQUE. venience to vessels of large draught entering before high water, but as soon as the tide begins to fall they must have a strong fair wind to get through. The entrance channel dries only within 2 cables' lengths of the outer harbour ; outside of this the depths in the channel vary from 1 to 8 feet in the furrows formed by the scouring water. From the Cunette sluice to the harbour, both sides of the channel are bordered by slopes of soft mud, upon which vessels are placed that cannot find room in the harbour, or those which come to refit and can bear to lie aground. Quai Neuf between the sluice and the Belveder rampart, is especially allotted to steam vessels, and the berths of mud upon which they lie are 2 or 3 feet above the level of low-water great springs. The berths along the stockade opposite the quay are about the same height, and are also of soft mud. Vessels lying in this channel should be securely moored, for a strong north erly wind sends a swell in. With westerly winds those of about 15 feet draught lie aground on these berths for 5 or 6 days, but with those from the eastward they only remain a day or two at the utmost. The Outer Harbour occupies the space between the town and the citadel, and is about 3 cables long, from 400 to 500 feet wide, and entirely surrounded with quays. It dries out at the springs, and the bottom for the most part is a mixture of sand, shingle, and mud ; towards the middle of the harbour it is covered with stinking black mud, broken tiles and bricks. Vessels lying alongside the quays ground upon a hard bottom, which at the foot of the citadel quay, on the north-west side of the harbour, is 3 to 4 feet above the level of the lowest tides ; at the foot of the Dutch and Holland quays it is obstructed by the ruins of old walls and piles covered with mud. When it blows strong from the northward the swell enters the harbour for about 2 or 3 hours each tide, but it does not inconvenience a vessel if she is well secured. There are careening and building slips at the upper end of the harbour, and strong cranes for masting. The Inner Harbour, which communicates directly with the outer har bour and dries out every tide, is nearly bordered throughout by an earth embankment. On its south side are three large building docks, and on its north side is the right wing of the storehouses surrounding the floating basin. The Floating Basin, called also the Naval basin, occupies a space of 32,820 square yards, and communicates with the outer harbour by a wide flood gate, the sleepers of which are on a level with low water great springs. AU vessels that can enter the harbour can enter the basin,"], [189, "CHAP. IV.] 173 PORT DE DUNKERQUE. but those of large draught are obliged to wait for nearly the top of high water to go over a ridge as hard clay in front of the gate, 4 or 5 feet higher than the sleepers. lights. \u2014 A handsome brick tower, 180 feet high, in the form of a tall column, is erected on the shore between the west jetty and the ruins of Risban fort. It stands S. by E. A E. 875 yards from the extremity of the west jetty, and exhibits, at 194 feet above high water, a revolving white light, dioptric and of the first order, the eclipses of which succeed each other every minute, and the bright intervals are visible in clear weather at the distance of 24 miles ; in ordinary weather the eclipses are not total within the distance of 12 miles, a faint light being seen between the bright intervals. A small fixed red light, catoptric and of the sixth order and elevated 23 feet above high water, is shown at the extremity ofthe west jetty, and may be seen at 3 miles. A fixed white light, dioptric and of the fifth order, and elevated 85 feet above high water, is exhibited from the Heuguenar tower S. by E.I E. 2,406 yards from the entrance between the jetty heads, and shows a bright ray N. by W. 1 W., in the direction of the entrance channel, visible 12 or 15 miles.

CAPE GRIS-NEZ TO DUNKERQUE. In entering the West Pass, run to the southward of the above striped red and black buoy, and then between the three black buoys which mark the northern, and the three red buoys which mark the southern limit of the Pass. Vessels of large draught may pass a cable's length to the southward of black buoy No. 1, even at low water, but if they are running in with a strong westerly wind at that time of tide, in order to avoid the narrow spit with 17 to 19 feet on it, which extends three quarters of a mile to the westward of black buoy No. 3, they should keep 2 or 3 cables to the southward of Black buoy No. 1, and sight the red buoys on the southern limit of the narrow. Large vessels, having to wait for high water to enter Dunkerque, anchor between the meridian of black buoy No. 5 and that of Petite Synthe church. The pilots always go out of the Pass to meet large vessels ; small vessels requiring one should make a signal as soon as they arrive in sight of the pilot vessel at anchor near red buoy No. 2. At Night, if the wind is in the same direction, after running the above course N.E. by E. | E. 12 miles from Cape Gris-Nez, or until Calais light bears S.S.E. \u00b1 E. and Cape Gris-Nez light S.W. by W., steer E.by S. until Gravelines light bears S.byE. \u00a3E. and Dunkerque revolv ing light E. by S. \\ S., when in ordinary weather a vessel should anchor to await daylight, or, if she has a pilot, she may run for Dunkerque road. If it is not advisable to anchor, short boards should be made in from 9 to 15 fathoms between the West Dyck and the land, within the limits where Calais light bears S.W f W. and Gravelines light S.S.E. \u00a3 E. With the wind between N.N.E. and E.N.E. long boards should be made in the Pas de Calais, until the town of Calais bears S.S.E. 1 E., when a vessel may stand in for the land, keeping the lead quickly going to avoid crossing the Riden de Calais. Boards of about 3 miles long can be made between the West Dyck and the edge of the 5 fathoms soundings, which borders the shore, but when on the meridian of Gravelines light house, short tacks should be made near the edge of these soundings, until the buoy is seen on the west end of the Snouw. From the Northward When bound from the North Sea to Dun kerque, or to the other French ports on this coast, endeavour to make the land about 4Cape Blanc-Nez, whatever may be the direction of the wind or the time of tide. The land to the south of west of this Cape, as far as Cape Gris-Nez, may be seen in ordinary weather at about 18 miles, and Mont Couple and the hills around it at 22 or 23 miles.

In clear weather there is no difficulty in turning to windward over this ground, but when the weather is foggy or thick the lead must be kept quickly going, so as not to stand into a less depth than 20 fathoms. At Night the lights at the South Foreland, Cape Gris-Nez, Calais, and even Dunkerque, may be seen in clear weather when a vessel is midway between the North Falls Tail and the south-west end of the Sandettie, and from this position, if the wind is from the east ward, Calais light may be steered for, or, if from the westward, the land between Calais and Cape Gris-Nez ; but to keep a safe dis tance from the coast, it will be necessary in the former case not to bring Cape Gris-Nez light to the westward of S.W. by W. \\ W. or Gravelines light to the eastward of S.E. by E. \u00a3 E., unless bound to Calais ; and in the latter case not to bring Cape Gris-Nez light to the westward of S.W.

With strong northerly winds, it would not be prudent to approach within 5 miles of the coast, not bringing Dunkerque light to the eastward of E. by S. \\ S. or Gravelines light to the eastward of S.E. f E. With strong westerly winds vessels sometimes keep to the westward of the Galloper and the Falls, to get smoother water. They pass either to the northward of the Galloper bank, or between that bank and the Four mile knolls. The course from a position 2 miles to the westward of the Galloper is S.W. by S., and after running about 35 miles in that direc tion the vessel will be 5 or 6 miles to the southward of the North Falls Tail, and Cape Gris-Nez light, if the weather is clear, will be in sight. Entering Dunkerque have good hawsers ready to moor head and stern, the anchors clear, and with a fair wind a heavy anchor to bring up by the stern. All possible sail should be carried to pass quickly through the breakers on the edge of the beach. Fresh northerly winds raise a heavy sea at the entrance, and the best time then for running in is at high water. When within the entrance channel there is no difficulty in reaching the harbour. Winds between N.W., round westerly, and S.S.W., when strong cause a heavy swell at the entrance. At this time keep close to the west jetty head and the western side of the channel until sheltered by that part of the jetty which is boarded up, as the flood stream crosses the open pilework, and runs with great rapidity upon the east jetty. This stream is at its greatest strength about half an hour before high water in the harbour."], [192, "176 [chap. iv. CAPE GRIS-NEZ TO DUNKERQUE. The most favourable time to enter, with moderate westerly winds, if a vessel's draught will permit, is when the stream slackens, or about half or three quarters of an hour after high water in the harbour. Strong easterly winds also raise a high sea at the entrance on a weather tide ; with these winds steer for the east jetty head, and then run along the eastern side ofthe channel. The entrance is not accessible to sailing vessels when it blows strong between S.S.W. and S.S.E., but the sea is then smooth in the road, and they can remain there without danger. During calms or light winds every effort should be made to close with the west jetty head to avoid being drifted to the eastward of the entrance by the flood stream, which runs at its greatest strength outside the jetties the whole time that large vessels can enter. The best time for those of light draught to run in is, directly the signal is made that there is sufficient water, before the flood has attained its greatest strength. Leaving Dunkerque. \u2014 Sailing vessels bound to the westward or the ports in the northern part of the North Sea generally wait for favour able winds and spring tides to quit the harbour. The gates of the floating basin are opened one hour before and closed about half an hour after high water. Winds with southing in them are the most favourable for leaving, but those that blow upon the coast, when they are strong, forbid any egress. If bound to the westward, the harbour should be left directly they float, if the wind is sufficiently- strong to stem the flood stream ; but with a light wind they should not start until near the top of high water, and then anchor in the road for the stream to slacken. On quitting the West Pass a W. by N. course will lead to the northward of the Riden de Calais, and when Calais lighthouse bears S.E. S., or Cape Gris-Nez lighthouse S.W. | W., a S.W. by W. f W. course will lead a safe dis tance to the westward of that Cape. If bound to the northward, and the vessel's draught will permit her to cross the banks northward of Dunkerque, the entrance channel should be left as early as possible before high water ; but this passage should never be attempted without a fresh fair, wind to enable her to run quickly over the banks. When clear of the jetties, steer N. \u00a3 W. to get the spire at Petite Synthe in line with the guard-house which stands about a mile to the westward of Dunkerque lighthouse, bearing S.W. f S ; then steer N.E. f- N., with the spire in one with the guard-house, crossing in succes sion the Braeck, the Smals, and the East Breedt banks, until the lead shows that the vessel is near the eastern edge of the East Dyck bank, when a N.E. by E. course for 35 miles will lead between Thornton rido*e and Bligh bank. The soundings on this latter course will be from 14 to 19"], [193, "chap, iv.] PORT DE DUNKERQUE ; DIRECTIONS ; TIDES. 177 fathoms. A cast of 9 or 10 fathoms may be had on tho two narrow shoals lying between Thornton ridge and Bligh bank. If the vessel's draught will not permit her to cross these banks, leave the harbour as soon as she floats, to benefit by the flood stream, which runs in the offing 3 hours after high water at Dunkerque, and when outside the jetties steer to enter Nieuport road by the Zuydcoote Pass. When clear of the Pass, steer E. by N. J N. through the road until Furnes is in one with a high sand hill, flattened at the summit and free from verdure, named Broers Duyn, (page 178,) bearing S. \u00a3 E. when the vessel will be on the narrow shoal joining the Smals bank to the Nieuport banks. From this position a N.E. N. course for 35 miles will lead through the North channel, and clear of all the banks. The only inconvenience in following this course is crossing the stream in an oblique direction, which must be allowed for. Frigates at anchor in Dunkerque road may gain the open sea by following the above route, but they must endeavour to run through the Zuydcoote Pass a short time before high water, and over the narrow shoal which unites the Smals bank to the Nieuport banks a short time after that period. Ostende light may be seen in ordinary weather until within 2 miles of the southern part of Thornton ridge. tides and tidal SIGNALS. \u2014 At Dunkerque it is high water, full and change, at 8 minutes after midnight, and the tide rises (above the level of the water which remains at low tide between the jetty heads, and above the sandy ridge at 160 yards outside the west jetty head) 20 feet at ordinary springs, 22 feet at great springs, and from 13 to 16 feet at the neaps. Strong northerly winds raise the tide 2 or 3 feet higher, but the sea is then heavy at the entrance. The springs, when easterly winds prevail, do not rise much higher than the neaps with fresh westerly winds. In calm weather the tide remains slack in the harbour at high water about 15 minutes ; 20 or 25 minutes, with westerly winds ; and 10 minutes with off-shore winds. A short distance outside the jetties the flood stream runs 2\\ in 3 hours after high water in the harbour. The tidal signals used at this port are the same as those noticed in page 3. They are made from the flagstaff erected upon the terrace of an elegant little building, standing S.S.E. 109 yards from the lighthouse, between the west jetty and Risban fort. aspect of coast. \u2014 The coast between Dunkerque and the frontier of Belgium and even beyond the frontier as far as Blankenberg, an extent of 33 miles, trends nearly in a straight line to the eastward. The shore being low and sandy, and bordered by sand hills, has a dull uniform appearance, and the only objects that can be recognized on the level plain in [E.C. \u2014 2.] N"], [194, "178 [chap. iv. CAPE GRIS-NEZ TO DUNKERQUE. the interior, are the clumps of trees surrounding the villages, the church towers, and the windmills. Between Dunkerque and the frontier, which is 7 miles to the eastward, some revenue guard-houses, and a large beacon named the Pilot's mast, may be seen on the sand hills near the shore, and an old ruined tower amongst the sand hills near Zuydcoote ; and beyond the frontier, the towers of Furnes, the ramparts and church tower at Nieuport, and a high sand hill N. \u00a3 W. from Furnes, named the Broers Duyn, which is flattened at the summit and may be easily recog nized at sea by its being totally free from verdure, whilst those near it are of a brown colour, being covered with bent grass. The sandy beach bordering the coast dries out a quarter of a mile at low water, and the depths outside it increase gradually to 4^ fathoms at a mile from the shore. To ground in bad weather upon this part of the coast on a falling tide, would be less fatal than upon the beach between Dunkerque and Mardick, for whatever may be the violence of the wind and surf, if a vessel runs stem on to the beach she will make a bed in the sand, and the tide will soon leave her, especially if she takes the ground about half an hour after high water at the springs. Assistance can then be afforded to the crew, and they may be saved if they remain on board until the tide has left her ; whereas a vessel to ground * upon the high beach westward of Dunkerque would become a total wreck, often with the loss of the crew, at whatever time of tide she runs ashore. tides Upon the north coast of France, as well as upon the English shore from Dover to the North Foreland, the tide takes 5\\ hours to rise at springs from the level of low water to that of high water, and 7^ hours to descend from that level to low water ; but these dura- tions vary according to the moon's age ; that of the flood increases pro- gressively from full and change to the following quarter, whilst that of the ebb decreases, so that two or three days after the quarter the duration of the ebb is as long as the flood ; it then increases gradually until the following full and change, and that of the flood decreases. In calm weather both streams in the offing have respectively about the same dura tion as the rising and falling tide on the shore, and their rate is in propor tion to the range of the tide. The flood stream is generally less rapid than the ebb, but the rate and duration of both are influenced by the winds. It has not yet been ascertained by any decisive experiments whether the range of the tides between the north coast of France and the estuary of the Thames is equal to that observed on the surrounding shores All that is positively known on the subject is, that as far as 15 or 16 miles"], [195, "179 chap, iv.] TIDAL STREAMS. from the French coast the vertical motions of the tides seem to follow very nearly the same law as upon the shore, they take place at the same times, and they appear to rise in an equal degree ; but if the rise of water at springs on this coast, at Calais, for example, is compared with that observed at the same tides on the coasts of Holland and Belgium, as well as at several positions in the estuary of the Thames, and especially at Orfordness, it would appear that beyond the distance of 15 or 16 miles from the French coast, in a N.N.E. and E.N.E. direction, the range of tide decreases in the same manner as upon the shores. It is even probable that this decrease is very rapid, for in the middle of the North Sea, between Holland and England, there are not more than 2 feet difference between high and low water ; the mariner, therefore, in deter mining his position by the depths marked on the chart, will have to diminish the allowance required for the rise of tide, according to his distance from the nearest shore. The tides upon the coasts of France, Belgium, and Holland, as well as upon the coast of England from Dover to the North Foreland, are pro duced by the tidal wave, which, having traversed in about 8 hours the whole extent of the English Channel, runs through Dover Strait and spreads into the North Sea. The flood stream, when at its greatest strength, takes an E.N.E. course, and its direction is only changed near the shore by the bends of the coast. The tides upon the English coast to the northward of the North Fore land are produced by a similar tidal wave, which, after having doubled the British Islands to the north, extends to the southward along the eastern coasts of Scotland and England, and runs directly towards the estuary of the Thames. The flood stream, when at its greatest strength, runs parallel with the English coast, but when it has reached the parallel of Orfordness, and the Thames opens out, it turns to the W.S.W., in an opposite direction to that which the flood stream follows near the coast of France. But as the changes in the tides in the offing occur later than tho times of high and low water on the shore, in proportion as the positions where they take place are distant from the land, the stream of flood on the French coast is evidently mixed in the neighbourhood of the Gabbard and Galloper banks with the ebb stream which runs out of the mouth of the Thames. CAUTION. \u2014 Mariners ought to bear in mind that the streams in the offing in the North Sea as well as in the Channel, are not signs to indi cate the rise and fall of the tide, as they are upon the shore ; for a vessel would be exposed to the greatest danger if she ran with the stream of flood towards a shoal lying far from the land, under the idea that in consequence N 2"], [196, "180 [chap. IV. CAPE GRIS-NEZ TO DUNKERQUE. of the direction of the stream the water was still rising upon the shoal and that she might venture to cross it. The flood stream only ceases to be felt in the vicinity of some of those banks which lie the farthest out from the coasts of France and Belgium, when it is nearly low water on the shore. When desirous of crossing a bank lying within 15 or 16 miles of the French coast, an approximate calculation should always be made of the number of feet the tide has risen above the soundings marked on the chart."], [197, "CHAP.

Seen from a westerly direction at a distance, both Guernsey and Jersey present a level of about 300 feet in height; the low land of Braye du Val in the former island, and that of St. Clement in the latter, being yet in the horizon. The outline of Guernsey, however, is somewhat more irregular than that of Jersey ; the western shore of the former is also clothed with a greater degree of verdure than that of the latter, and appears of a deeper shade. St. Ouen bay in Jersey has suffered very considerably from the encroach ments of the sea-sand, so much so that the whole of the western land between La Corbiere point and Le Tac point appears identified with it. ASPECT or guernsey. \u2014 The most remarkable objects which first pre sent themselves, when running for the south-west end of Guernsey, are the white castellated tower of Rocquaine, Pleinmont guard-house, Torteval church, and the tower of La Ree.* The former stands nearly in the centre of the sandy bay which bears that name, and the latter in the northern part of the said bay, near Lihou island ; on the heights to the southward of the bay stands Pleinmont guard-house, very little removed from the edge of the cliff. Torteval church, with its high steeple, stands at a little distance inland, being as conspicuous in this quarter of the island as Catel and Val churches are in the northern part. As the coast is approached, the declivity of the northern land begins gradually to rise from the horizon, presenting a surface diversified with houses, churches, windmills, and groups of trees, and which are still more conspicuous if seen from a north-westerly position. All the western shore of Guernsey * The light tower to be erected on the Hanois rocks, off the western side of the island, will soon become a conspicuous object by day, and ils light will be an invaluable guide by night."], [199, "CHAP.

The first objects seen are the churches of St. Pierre and St. Ouen ; St. Ouen windmill, with an extensive range of buildings on the sandy heights, called the bar racks of St. Ouen, and now and then the turret of Ste. Marie church, with that of Tour d'Auvergne, or La Hogue, will appear from among the trees in the interior of the island. St. Pierre and St. Ouen churches stand high ; the steeple of the former is lofty, that of the latter merely a turret. On a nearer view the six Mortella towers on the sandy beach in St. Ouen bay will present themselves, and also the Corbiere rock, with the declining land to the south-eastward, the surface of which latter is covered with wood, and its base with sand and rock. Such are the features which characterize Guernsey and Jersey, nor can they be mistaken even by a stranger. In fine weather these islands may be seen at the distance of 27 miles. refraction. \u2014 To show the strange effects of refraction, it may be noticed that from a station near Verclut guard-house in Jersey, the top ofthe south-eastern battlement of Seymour tower exactly coincides with the line of the visible horizon at low-water great spring tides ; some times, however, when viewed from the same position, it has appeared con siderably below that line, and in several instances above it. In this case the line of sight passes partially over the surface of the rocky ledge called Violet bank, and over the sandy strand in its vicinity, as well as over the sea, and is at a mean height of 6-f feet above it. Similar variations in the refraction have been observed on the French coast between the steeple of Coutances, and the summit of the trees in that neighbourhood, and also in the vicinity of Cancale. winds and weather. \u2014 The prevailing winds among the Channel Islands in the winter are those from between S.S.E., round southerly, and W.N.W. ; the latter, however, is most predominant : and it is fortunate that against the occasional furious effects of this wind Guernsey and Jersey should offer such good security for shipping. During the summer months, vernal and autumnal equinoxes, the winds appear variable and uncertain. There is an opinion that easterly winds last longer, when they set in, and set in with more uniformity in this neighbourhood than has been observed elsewhere during the winter season. Southerly and south westerly winds during that period are almost universally accompanied with"], [200, "184 [chap. v. CHANNEL ISLANDS. or followed by stormy weather, which seldom or ever clears up until the wind changes to the north-west, which it almost invariably does. The state of the weather, as well as the direction and force of the wind, in the vicinity of Alderney, does not always correspond with that at Guernsey and Jersey, being frequently local or peculiar to itself; owing, perhaps, to the island being in the immediate vortex of the tides, which are in a constant state of rotation, ancl this more particularly during the new and full moon. At that period a difference of four points has been experienced, viz., the wind from E. b. N. at Guernsey and Sercq, and from N.E. b. N. at Alderney ; both blowing at the same time upon a south- western tide, lightly or moderately in the neighbourhood of the former, while vessels near the latter were under double-reefed sails. Upon a north- eastern stream the wind has often been found S.W. b. W. at Alderney, while at Herm it blew West, with similar variety in strength, and this without any perceptible cause (the attraction of the tides excepted), or any difference in the barometer at the two places. The southerly, south-easter!}', northerly, and north-easterly winds also invariably blow from Alderney in strong irre gular gusts, more particularly the first and last. soundings. \u2014 The quality of the ground at the different anchorages, as stated in the following pages, is such as experience points out to be the case after a continuation of moderate weather; but a long series of gales of wind from the westward has been found to cause a sensible alter ation, sending in great quantities of loose shingle and pieces of shells ; while north-eastern gales have had a contrary effect, by washing away what had accumulated during the western gales. This is more particularly observable in the neighbourhood of Jersey. This is mentioned to provide against the uncertainty which would natu rally attend a vessel in being apparently deceived in the soundings between the islands during the night. In general, however, the blue, red, and yellow granitic sand is peculiar to the neighbourhood of all the islands, but to Guernsey and Alderney in particular, though often diversified in appear ance by a mixture of other substances. It is said that the Schole bank, which lies nearly in a direct line be tween the Great Russel channel and the Race of Alderney, has increased in size since the year 1S04, and that the soundings are more regular in their approach than formerly ; whether, however, this increase may have arisen from a uniform impulse, or from the temporary effect of gales of wind, is undetermined ; but from observations which were made expressly for the purpose, at the entrance of those bights and harbours unaffected by indraft, ti appears evident that the several banks and shoals of loose sand and shingle"], [201, "CHAr. V.] 185 WINDS AND WEATHER ; SOUNDINGS. in this neighbourhood are occasionally elevated and depressed; the Chateau banks in Grouville bay, Jersey, may be instanced, where this effect has been repeatedly witnessed.* On comparing the depths of water between Sercq and Jersey, as well as the nature of the ground, it may be safely inferred, after continued moderate weather, that if a vessel should get less than 29 fathoms, with rotten ground and pieces of shells, she will be tothe north-eastward of a line drawn from Cape Grosnez, the north-east point of Jersey, to Sercq, or upon it; and if more than 30 fathoms, with a bottom of sand, shells, or a coarse, free, ground, she will be to the south-westward of that line. Also, if\" when between Sercq and the French coast she should get a depth ofabout 26 fathoms, with rotten ground and pieces of shells, she will be to the southward of a line drawn from Sercq to Rosel point, or upon it : and if in that depth, or thereabouts, a coarse, clean, ground is found, she will be to the northward of that line. Again, when between the Ecrehou and the Anquette rocks, if the water deepens suddenl}', she will be drawing to the northward ; if the water shoals suddenl}', to the south ward ; and if it shoals gradually she will be nearing the French shore. caution. \u2014 The various marks for the rocks and passages in the neighbourhood of these islands are all given as for slack water ; the utmost attention must therefore be paid in shaping courses which lead across the stream, whether directly or obliquely, and due allowance must be made for its influence. guernsey. \u2014 This island is nearly in the form of a right-angled triangle, the north-west side forming the hypothenuse, the length of which is about 7 miles.

Some inconvenience is said to be experienced in the Great Road from the effects ofa strong north-eastern gale ; but a vessel has it always in her power to put to sea, by night or day, either at high or low water, if she should part from her anchors, which can hardly happen with common precaution. A vessel should moor in the Great road, with open hawse, to the S. b. E., and within the following limits, viz. : \u2014 southern limit, the beacon on the Tremies, half way between the right extreme of castle Cornet and St. Peter Port church ; northern limit, the beacon on the Sardrette and Victoria tower in line; western limit, the outer angle of castle Cornet in one with the white beacon on Fermain point ; and eastern limit, the beacon on the Anfre in line with left extreme of buildings on high land over St. Martin point. Here there are from 5 to 11 fathoms water, fine sand ; but farther to the southward the bottom is coarse, and the depth increases to 20 fathoms. The lilTTlE road of Guernsey lies to the northward of castie Cornet, between it and the rocks called the Blanche and Sardrette, on both of which are placed beacons. This road is invariably used by the traders and .small vessels, and affords excellent shelter in from 2 to 4 fathoms water, over fine muddy sand with sea-weed, from almost all winds that blow ; that from the N.E. b.

The usual and the best method of mooring in this road is to drop the starboard anchor near castle Cornet, and the other near the Blanche rock, so as to ensure an open hawse to the eastward. When moored, the town church should be a boat's length open to the southward of the white watch-house on the south pier-head, and Jerbourg signal tower shut in with castle Cornet, or Marais mill its own breadth open to the eastward of Hogue-a-la-Pere tower.

ST. pierre harbour. \u2014 The old tidal harbour of St. Pierre before the recent improvements commenced was 4^- acres in extent, with ],025 feet of quay room, the width of the latter being only 20 feet. By recent alterations an additional length of 300 feet of berthage is added, and the breadth of the quays increased to a minimum of 50 feet. The entrance is 80 feet wide, and the deplh at high water springs between the pier heads is 24f feet, and about 14J feet at neaps; the average depth along the quays on the same tides being respectively 20 and 10 feet. The new harbour works comprise two esplanades (one on each side of the old harbour) running parallel with the sea front ofthe town, and averaging together 2,500 feet in length, and 150 in breadth. From these esplanades spring two breakwaters, one on either side, and equidistant from the old harbour, being 2:500 feet apart at the base, and projecting to the east ward so as to inclose the natural sandy bay in front ofthe town. The south or Castle breakwater is carried across the rocky isthmus, by which at low water springs castle Cornet is connected with the main, and terminates at the north-west bastion of the castle, being 1,900 feet in length. The southern face of this breakwater consists of an upright wall and parapet constructed of rough masonry, and carried to a height of 15 feet above the highest tides. Along this is constructed a level road way and footpath 40 feet wide. On the north side and under the lee of this arm a floating dock is in course of construction, having an area of 10 acres, and a lengih of 2,675 feet of quays, which are 84 feet wide."], [206, "190 [chap. v. CHANNEL ISLANDS ; GUERNSEY. It is intended that the level of the water in this dock be retained to that ofthe lowest high water neaps, which on those tides will give 18 feet on the sill and along 1,425 feet of the quays, the remaining 1,250 feet having a depth of only 14 feet, but these berths can be deepened if necessary. The width of the entrance will be 50 feet, and the depth on the sill and along the deep berths 28 feet at high water springs, in which case and until the tide falls to the constant level the gates will be open and the dock simply treated as an open harbour. Between the dock and castle Cornet it is proposed to construct ship building yards, having two slips each 250 feet long and 100 feet wide, which will admit of four vessels being simultaneously constructed, ranging from 1,500 to 2,000 tons burthen. It is further intended to project a rough stone break water 600 feet to the eastward from the north-east salient angle of castle Cornet. The north or St. Juliens breakwater begins on the north side of the old harbour, at the extremity of the new esplanade, and will extend 1,300 feet in an easterly direction along the rocky margin of the natural bay, and from thence 750 feet towards the north-east angle of castle Cornet; the head and the last 350 feet of which will be in 12 feet water at the lowest springs, and under its lee a slipway 300 feet long and 30 feet wide will be constructed capable of admitting alongside the largest class vessel. The parapet of the breakwater will be 10 feet above high water, and the shore portion of the arm will have sloped sides strongly paved with large granite blocks. The surface will be finished with a roadway 30 feet wide, and a raised terrace 10 feet wide. To the eastward of the north esplanade a pier has been constructed from the angle of the old north pier, and it incloses a careening hard 300 feet long, and 150 feet wide for repairing vessels. At its entrance an excellent tidal berth 150 feet in length has been constructed, having 14 feet water at neap tides, and it is intended here to erect masting sheers. The works above described inclose a space (exclusive ofthe areas ofthe floating dock, building yards, old harbour, &c. -Src.) of about 57 acres, the entire of which is covered at low water neaps. Of this space 20 acres have from 10 to 22 feet at low water neaps, and from 20 to 32 at high water. At low water springs only 20 acres of the 57 remain covered, and of this 15 acres have a varying depth of from 0 to 9 feet, and the remaining 5 acres from 9 to 12 feet; at high water springs their areas have respec tively from 30 to 39 feet, and from 39 to 42 feet. From this it will be seen that there will be only 5 acres of available anchorage within the new harbour with an average depth of only 10 feet water; but it is recom mended that an area of 30 acres in extent be dredged to a uniform depth f 9 feet below the lowest tides."], [207, "CHAP.

Be careful when rounding castle Cornet for the Little road not to haul to the westward until the town church is within a sail's breadth distance of the watch-house on the south pier head, by which pre caution a vessel will pass to the north-eastward of the Bouees du Nord. At Night, when running for Guernsey roads from the northward and east ward through the Great Russel, steer to the south-westward till the lighton the south pier head of St. Pierre harbour bears N.W. b.

V.] 193 ST. SAMSON HARBOUR. The flood stream between Guernsey and the rocks projecting from the south-west end of Jethou island, takes two different directions ; one arm runs directly through the Great road and thence into the Little Russel ; another branches off at right angles nearly from the former, runs to the east ward towards Jethou, and through the before-mentioned rocks into the Great Russel. The ebb steam runs directly the reverse ; the stream from the Great Russel uniting with that in the road, after it has passed the rocks at Jethou, from whence they both set to the south-westward. By bringing the Grande Braye rock a boat's length open to the westward of the round battery on Brehon rock, a vessel will keep in the former draught (or road tide), and the said rock if brought in one with the battery will place her in the latter (or in-draught of the Great Russel). A vessel being obliged to work into Guernsey roads from the southward, with a westerly wind, will derive great advantage by paying attention to this division of the stream. The stream in the Little road from half-flood till half-ebb sets E. b. N., and from half-ebb to half-flood W. b. S. The strand, however, between the castle and the island, drying at low-water springs, prevents the appearance of any tides while so uncovered. ST. samson harbour is on the eastern side of Guernsey between Val castle and Mont Crevel, but vessels lie aground in it at low water.* The site now occupied by this harbour was originally the eastern entrance creek to an arm of the sea which severed the northern portion of Guernsey from the main island. About 60 years since this strait was embanked at each end, and since that period the intervening land has been reclaimed. The harbour may be termed rectangular in form, its extreme length being about 1,900 feet, by an average width of 500 feet, and containing a water area at high water springs of 22 acres. At low water springs this space is entirely dry, and the tide ebbs for some distance beyond the pier heads. Owing to the disturbed state of the harbour in gales from the East and S.E., it was proposed in 1855 to construct a breakwater to extend 650 feet in a southerly direction from the north shore and to terminate 120 feet to the north-east of the south pier head, leaving an entrance 120 feet wide. These alterations are now, in 1859, nearly completed, and have much improved the condition of the harbour. There is a depth of 15 feet between the piers at high water ordinary neaps, 12 feet along the south pier, and 11 feet for a length of 150 feet along the south quay, the re mainder of which gradually shoals to its western extremity. * See plan of St. Samson harbour on Admiralty Chart of Alderney, No. 60 ; scale, m = 14 inches.

The approach to St. Samson harbour is difficult, being athwart the tidal streams, and on account of the Crabier, Grunette, and Grand Demie rocks which lie off the entrance. The most dangerous of these is the Crabier, in the fairway of the entrance, and distant about 300 yards from the head of Mont Crevel breakwater ; it has, however, been lately reduced in height, having now 9 feet on it at half tide. The best entrance into the harbour is between the Crabier and the Grunette (which passage, however, is not above balsa cable wide,) and the leading mark is the white (or south-western) house on Jethou island wholly open to the northward of the battery on Brehon rock (but nearly touching it),* which will lead to the outer warping-buoy ; then steer right in, between the pier heads; the bottom is blue clay covered with a layer of sand. bordeaux harbour, to the northward of St. Samson, is used only by fishermen. Here vessels must lie aground the same as at St. Samson, and as the entrance to the harbour will not admit of larger vessels than those of 10 tons burthen, a farther description would be needless. ANCRESSE BAV, on the north side of the island to the westward of fort Le Marchant, affords good shelter for small craft against south easterly, southerly, and westerly winds, in from 2 to 3 fathoms water. The bottom is muddy sand, and excellent for holding. GRAND-havre is situated lo the westward of Ancresse bay and to the north-westward of Val church, and the entrance to it is between the mortella towers of Mont Guet and Rousse point. It affords excellent anchorage for small vessels in from 14 to 9 feet water, with good shelter against southerly and all easterly winds, over a bottom of sand and grass ; north-westerly winds, however, send in a very heavy swell and sea, between half flood and half-ebb, though there is little danger to be apprehended if the ground tackling be good. For vessels capable of taking the ground, there is a safe place for that purpose on the south-eastern side of Rousse point. A dangerous rock lies right in the fair-way ofthe entrance, called the Rousse de Mer, which appears at a quarter ebb, and on each side of it there are several other rocks.

Or, the mortella tower on Rousse point in line with the telegraph on fort George, will lead in between the Rousse de Mer and the Main rocks, until Delancy mill conies open to the south westward of Val church, as before stated. VAZON and pekelle BAVS, on the north-west side of Guernsey, are never used but by fishing boats, and scarcely afford any shelter even to them, unless when hauled ashore. rocquaine bav, on the western side of Guernsey, within the Hanois rocks, affords good shelter for small craft against southerly, easterly, and north-easterly winds, in from 2 to 3 fathoms water over fine gravel mixed with grass and sea-weed ; it is, however, only fre quented by the fishermen resident in its neighbourhood, or occasionally by vessels calculated to take the beach. Westerly winds send in such a heavy swell and sea, particularly between half-flood and half-ebb, that a sailing vessel caught in the bay, under the above circumstances of wind and tide, could not possibly succeed in getting out. The leading mark into the bay is St. Pierre church four times its own breadth open to the south ward of Coudray mill, bearing S.E. petit port, on the southern side of Guernsey between Icart and Jerbourg points, affords good shelter against easterly, northerly, and north-westerly winds, in from 5 to 9 fathoms water, over a bottom of fine clean sand.

There is one great con venience attending this anchorage, viz., that the tide runs 9 hours to the southward and only 3 hours to the northward ; the former stream com mencing when it is low water by the shore, and setting directly into the Great Russel during the whole ofthe flood, until half-ebb, when the latter stream begins, and runs faintly to the northward until low water.

The approach to the Brayes, as well as to the Anfroques, is exceedingly dan gerous, as well on account of the tides, as for the numerous hidden and other rocks by which they are encompassed ; the principal of which, and the most dangerous are, the Platte Bouee, the Boufresses, the Demie du Nord, in the neighbourhood of the Anfroques; and the Platfougeres, &c, in the vicinity of the Brayes.* Brayes rocks. \u2014 To clear the Brayes, and all danger to the eastward and south-eastward of them, keep the south-western end of Little Sercq a little open to the eastward of the low north-eastern sandy point of Herm island, bearing S. \u00a3 E. ; this mark will lead into the fair-way of the Little Russel channel.

At the north-eastern entrance, however, of the Little Russel, between the Brayes and the Anfroques, the stream takes the direction of that in the offing, viz., the first 2 hours of the flood sets directly for the north end of Herm island, gradually joining the south western stream in the Russel, and the last hour ofthe flood, as well as the first of the ebb. The stream in the narrow strait, called Doyle Pass, on the north coast of Guernsey runs to the south-eastward from 2 hours ebb to 5 hours flood, and from 5 hours flood until 2 hours ebb it runs to the north-westward. The stream in the vicinity of the Grand Braye rock is subject to still greater varieties and inequalities : N.N.W., at about 2 miles distance from the rock, from low water until one hour's flood, it runs S.S.W., from 1 to 3 hours S.S.E., from half-flood to 4 hours flood East, from 4 hours until 5 hours flood E.N.E., from 5 hours flood until half-ebb N.W., from half-ebb tiil 5 hours ebb West, and then S.W. till low water again.

The stream in Grand-Havre sets directly in and out, the flood running in S. b. E. for 6 hours, and the ebb N. b. W. In Rocqnaine bay it sets to the north-eastward from 2 hours flood until half an hour after high water, when it slacks and remains so for 3 hours, or until half ebb; it then runs down to the south-westward, and so continues until 2 hours flood, when it again sets to the north-eastward. To the southward ofthe Hanois rocks, and W. -| S. one mile from Plein mont watch-house, the stream begins to run S.S.W. \u00a3 W. at low water, and so continues until 2 hours flood, when it sets S.E. b.

[chap. v. sercq \u2014 This island lies 3\u00a3 miles S.S.E. from Herm, and divides the Great Russel from the Deroute channel. The island, which is lofty in all its extent, is about 2\u00a3 miles long, including Little Sercq, to which it communicates by an isthmus or very narrow causeway (called La Coupee), and rather more than 1\u00a3 miles broad. The small island of Brecqhou lies on its western side, from which it is separated by a narrow channel of only 40 yards across, named by the islanders the Gulion Pass, through which the tides run with great velocity. The approach to Sercq on the north eastern, eastern, south-eastern, and south-western sides is difficult and hazardous, by reason of the numerous rocks which encompass it, as well as by the rapidity and irregularities of the tide in its immediate vicinity. These difficulties, however, may be easily overcome, if common attention be paid to the leading marks and run of the stream, and the island will afford good security against almost all winds, as will be shown in the description ofthe different bays.* There are several small inlets in various parts of the rocky coast of this island, where the inhabitants haul up and secure their boats in stormy weather, the most noted and frequented of which is Le Creux, so called from a subterraneous passage in its neighbourhood. It lies on the eastern side of the island, and is the general rendezvous for landing and shipping, when the weather will permit, as well as the principal resort of the fishing and other island boats; the beach, which is very much exposed to the south-eastward, being furnished with crabs for the purpose of heaving them up. dangers on east coast.\u2014 The following are the principal dangers on the eastern coast of Sercq : \u2014 sardriere Rock lies about a quarter of a mile off the north point of Sercq, and is not dangerous, as there is never less than 7 fathoms water over it. The Burons are a cluster of cragged rocks, in the form of half a moon, rising nearly perpendicularly from the sea ; and close to their south-eastern and eastern sides there are 16 fathoms water. They lie about E.S.E., a quarter ofa mile from Le Creux, and between them and Sercq is the Goulet pass, which dries half-way across at low-water springs ; the deepest water being towards the island. Through this pass the tides run ver}' rapidly both ways, but especially about half flood, setting right for and over the two rocks called the Founder and the Grune de Nord on the north side, and the Pierre Carree on the south side, which in light winds it is hardly possible to avoid ; this pass therefore should not be attempted but on the greatest emergency. * View 45."], [221, "205 CHAP. V.] DANGERS ON EAST COAST. Many rocks lie to the eastward of the Burons, between which are several navigable channels, with 18 fathoms water; they are, however, seldom frequented but by the island boats, on account of the impetuous whirl of the tides. Blanchard Rock lies about 2 miles to the eastward of Sercq, and never appears but on spring tides ; the marks for it are, the Conchee rock, which lies half a mile to the southward ofthe Burons, in one with a remarkable cavity, or chasm, to the northward of La Coupee, (called the Convache,) bearing W. by N. \u00a3 N., and the Corbee du Nez (the high rock next to the north-east extreme of the island) in line with the Gorge (the south-west end of the Petit Moie), N.W. 1 N.

W. i W. leads half a mile to the eastward; and the northern bluff land on Herm island in sight to the north-eastward of the Bee du Nez, N.W. A N.,j leads to the northward. The only dangers lying off Baleine bay, on the south-eastern side of Sercq, (notwithstanding the numerous overfalls and various discolorations of the water which appear on all sides) are, the Tetes de la Conchee, the Gripe, the Vingt Clos, and the Balmie, the former of which have never less than 5 fathoms water over them. The Gripe is right in the fair-way of the entrance to Baleine bay, and has never less than 10 feet over it; the marks for it are, the Conchee in line with the Goulet rock, N.E. b. N., and the Balmie in one with the Pignon, W. \u00a3 N. The conchee, lying about half a mile to the southward of the Burons, is always above water, and steep-to on its south-eastern, eastern, and north-eastern sides ; it is therefore unnecessary to give it a berth of more than half a cable in passing it. This rock, in 1855, was whitewashed to render it a conspicuous mark. The Balmie is considerably within and to the westward of the Gripe, and, as it appears at a quarter ebb, is of course to be feared only until that period ; it lies with the Baleine, which is always above water, in line with La Coupee or isthmus, N. \u00a3 W., and the western side of the Burons touching Viquette point (the point to the northward of the Conchee), N.E. b.

It has also this inconvenience attending it, that, should the wind suddenly shift to the northward or north-eastward at low water, (the tide running 3 hours to the southward after that period,) a sailing vessel could not possibly weather the strong indraught of the Goulet pass (the effects of which are sensibly felt half a mile to the north-eastward of it), and must therefore ride until the offing-tide slacks, or (at least if hard pressed) until there is water through the Goulet. * See plans of Baleine bay, scale, m = 2j inches, and Grand Greve bay, scale, m *= 3-J inches, on Admiralty Chart of Alderney and the Casquets, No. 60."], [223, "207 CHAP.

A W., or La Chapelle half a point open to the eastward of Banquette low point, S. W.* Between these limits a vessel may also work in. The Noire rock is steep-to on all sides but the south ; nor is there any danger to be apprehended between it and the an chorage, or between it and the island. No particular marks can be given to lead into this anchorage from the southward, that is, between the Grande Moie and the island, but there are never less than 4 fathoms water between them, and the best method is to steer in as nearly through mid-channel as possible. The mark for anchoring is the east extreme of the Burons just open of Robert point, and midway between the Petite Moie and the island ; without, or to the east ward of this mark, the stream runs very strong ; within, or to the westward of it, it is scarcely perceptible. banquette BAV, on the north-western side of Sercq, affords good shelter against easterly, south-easterly, and southerly winds, in from 5 to 16 fathoms water, over coarse sand interspersed with small black stones and pieces of sea-weed. Should the wind chop round to the W.N.W. a vessel at anchor in this bay would even then be enabled to weather the Bee du Nez, and may from thence push to sea, or haul under the lee of the island. The marks for anchoring (so as to provide against every emergency) are, Little Sercq mill just in sight to the westward of the Moie de Gulion, (a high rock in the Gulion pass,) and the Givaude rock just open to the westward of the .western end of Brecqhou island. In heavy gales from the north-eastward, or westward, the bank (from which this anchorage takes its name) has been found to shift a cable's length or more in one tide, which here runs to the south-eastward from low water till half-flood, and from half-ebb till low water to the south westward. ia grande greve. \u2014 The name of Grande Greve or great beach is applied to another anchorage on the south-western side of Sercq, between Brecqhou and Little Sercq, but it is much contracted by rocks calbd the Dents, the Hautes Bouees, the Baveuse, &c.

A W.S.W. wind, from the long fetch it commands, brings in a very heavy swell, and the obstruction which the water experiences at the Gulion pass increases it to such a height as to preclude the possibility of a vessel's riding. Should the seaman, therefore, be unavoidably caught by a westerly wind while riding at this anchorage, he should immediately endeavour to get out, either to the westward, or through the Gulion pass, which latter may with confidence be attempted at half-flood.

A small rock not more than 3 feet in diameter, and called the Bouee de la Baie, lies right in the fair-way of the anchorage ; it appears awash at low water, and from it La Chapelle is in line with Le Jeu point, and the eastern side of the Pierre au Nor man is in one with the chasm between the Moie de Gulion and the island called the Four. The before-mentioned mark to clear the Hautes Bouees will also lead to the southward of the Bouee de la Baie ; and La Chapelle in line with Le Jeu point, the mark above given for the Bouee de la Baie, will lead considerably to the southward of the Dents. TIDES. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Sercq at 6h. 30m. ; ordinary springs rise 25^ feet; neaps 14 feet. The streams in the immediate vicinity of this island are subject to a great variety of courses during the 12 hours, their direction being governed by the peculiar configuration of the land. On its north-eastern side there is a tract of water, in which a perpetual eddy, or slack tide, exists during the 6 hours that the stream occupies in running to the north-eastward in the Great Russel and the Deroute channels, extend ing nearly 3 miles from the land, and gradually contracting in breadth as it increases its distance from the shore.

The streams in Baleine bay, in Terrible bay, and in the neighbour hood of the Conchee, Baleine, and Balmie rocks, run 8-Jjr hours to the N.E. b. E., and only 3^ hours to the south-westward. The former stream begins when it is low water by the shore, and runs until 2^ hours ebb, when the south-western stream commences and runs faintly for the remaining 3i hours, or until low water again. The streams on the north-eastern side of Sercq, in La Greve, and in the neighbourhood of the rocks called the Grande and Petite Moie, &c, run 81 hours to the S. b. E., and only 3-fc hours to the N. b. W. The southern stream commences at 4 hours flood, and runs until half an hour after low water, when the northern stream commences and runs faintly for the remaining 3^ hours, or until 4 hours flood again. The southern stream above mentioned, on the north-eastern side of Sercq and the northern one on the south-eastern side, branch off circuitously to the eastward of the Burons, where they meet and unite with the Deroute stream, which sets directly both ways, and runs for equal spaces of time. A curved line drawn from the Grune-noire towards the Etat de Sercq to the southward, and to the point of intersection* before mentioned, on the north-eastern side of the island, will divide the irregular streams (in-shore) from that of the Deroute; and this line continued from the above point of intersection, close round the Bee du Nez towards the Givaude rock, and thence to within 4 cables of the Etat again, will divide the regular Russel stream from the irregular one within it. The stream on the north-western side of Sercq begins to run to the southward at the Bee du Nez, and thence along the land towards Brecqhou island at three-quarters flood, near which it meets with the stream from the Gulion pass ; which latter, prevailing over the former, carries it circuitously into the Great Russel to the north-westward, where it unites with that regular stream. The stream begins to run to the north-eastward along the shore from the Moie de Gulion, towards the Bee du Nez, at three-quarters ebb, and so continues until three-quarters flood again.

On the contrary, the force and shape which the flood acquires by the contraction between Sercq and Brecqhou is continued until it falls into the Russel, irresistibly carrying the other streams with it. The same is the case with the ebb until it unites with the stream to the south-westward of the Hautes Bouees. casquets. \u2014 The islands and rocks occupying a large portion of the space between Brehat island and Cape de la Hague, extend to the northward as far as the parallel of that Cape, where they form a sort of chain 10 miles long, from west to east, and 4 miles wide from north to south. This chain forms three distinct groups, namely, the Casquets islets and rocks lying at its western extremity, the island of Alderney at the eastern, and Burhou island occupying the centre position. They are separated from the coast of France by a wide channel called the Rare of Alderney, and in a similar manner from the island of Guernsey and its islets.* The Casquets islets and rocks lie N.W. b. W.-J-W., nearly 6 miles from Alderney telegraph, and form an isolated group about 1^ miles in length from west to east, and from 2 to 3 cables in breadth. The northern islet, which is of a conical form and bears the light-towers, rises about 100 feet above high water springs, and may be seen in clear weather at the distance of 11 or 12 miles. The southern islet is much lower, flat on the top, and can only be seen at half that distance. These islets stand on the basis of a mass of rock 4 cables long and 2 cables wide, which uncovers at low water; seven or eight large rocks rise from it, the tops of which are always uncovered during the highest tides. This mass of rock extends to the eastward beyond the islets, and terminates abruptly in a large rock named Cottette point. The islets are bold-to, but the impetuosity of the streams renders any attempt at anchoring in their vicinity rather hazardous, and the water is deep.

Neither should the channel be at tempted from the northward on an ebb or south-western stream, which sets right upon the Quest and Frouquies, except in case of emergency, nor without a steady wind, nor by any person not completely master of the tides. There is, however, no danger to be apprehended on a north eastern stream with a leading wind, as this stream assumes a more northerly direction after it passes the Ortach, and will consequently act as an offset.

The stream in the Casquet channel, that is, in its immediate draft, begins to set to the south-westward at half-ebb exactly on the shore, and runs in that direction for 6 hours, or until half-flood, and the contrary with respect to the north-eastern stream, for there is neither high nor low water slack here. The stream which begins to run to the north-eastward at half flood, after passing the Ortach, gradually veers to the northward and sets N.N.E. until it again unites with the stream flowing round the northern side of the Casquets. The south-western stream of this channel, which commences at half-ebb, sets right upon the Quest and the Frouquies, to avoid which the utmost care must be taken. On the south-western side of the Ortach rock, there is an eddy of nearly 1-lf miles in extent, between half-ebb and one hour's flood, after which period the stream gradually inclines to the westward, on the south side of the Ortach, setting at 2 hours flood directly for the Casquets, until its progress is arrested by the last of the south-western stream in the Casquet channel. Tliere is no eddy of consequence on the north-eastern side of the Ortach. PASSE du singe. Between Burhou island and Alderney is the chan nel called the Passe du Singe, or Monkey channel, the narrowest part of which, between Burhou and the Corbet rock, is scarcely three-quar ters of a mile from side to side, but it gradually widens to the eastward or westward. This like the Casquet channel, abounds with broken water even in the calmest weather, produced by the rapidity ofthe stream. There are also two overfalls in it which are very dangerous for open boats; between half-ebb and half-flood they are on the south-western side ofthe Narrows, and the other 6 hours they shift to the north-eastern side. These overfalls are caused solely by the tide, for the water being greatly contracted between Burhou and Alderney, there is not a sufficient passage for its escape ; which causes a higher level on one side of the Narrows than on the other, and hence the overfalls occasioned by the declivity. This difference of level is apparent even to the eye. During easterly winds, on the north-east stream, the overfalls extend nearly across the passage, from the east end of Burhou island to off the outer end of the breakwater, from half flood to half ebb on the shore. With westerly winds, on the south-west stream, they extend from the Ortach to the Elats, from half ebb to half flood on the shore. Both over falls should be avoided when blowing hard, which may be done by keeping near the Corbet, the Etats, and the Alderney shore.

One branch, however, of the flood, to the westward of the Narrows, sets through between Burhou island and the Ortach ; and, to the eastward of the Narrows, it veers and sets circuitously round the Pierres de But to the north westward, and both uniting with the Casquets channel tides, and ultimately with that of the English Channel, again sets to the eastward. The last 2 hours ofthe south-western stream in the Singe gradually veers towards the Casquets, as it recedes from the draft of the former passage. The velocity of the north-eastern stream, during the springs, is 1\\ miles; that of the south-western stream 6\\ miles per hour. alderney, or aurignit island, is only 3} miles long, east and west, and 1 J- miles wide where broadest, which is near the west end.

W. | W. 8\u00a3 miles from Cape de la Hague, and about the same distance from the Casquets. Until of late years, Alderney possessed but two small harbours ; one, called Port Longy, on the south-eastern side of the island, and the other, the old harbour of Braye, on the northern side, both of which dry at low water neaps. The Harbour of Refuge, now in course of construction in Braye bay on the northern part of the island, already shelters from N.W. and westerly gales, and encloses Braye road, the old harbour of Braye, and the new harbour of Craby, which latter is chiefly used by vessels employed in bringing material for the new works. The appearance of Alderney from a distance is wild and gloomy, but with the exception of the heights on the south-west end, which are covered with heath, the land is generally cultivated and fertile. The western and southern sides of the island consist of high precipitous cliffs, intersected by narrow vallies. The northern and eastern sides are, in general, much less elevated, and the coast is formed by a series of bays of sand and gravel, separated from each other by steep projecting points ; but, with the exception of the small bays of Braye, Saline, and Corbelets, the intervals of beach are inaccessible, on account of the outlying rocks which forbid all approach. The population of the island in 1 846 amounted to 950, but in consequence of the Government works it had increased to upwards of 5,000 in 1858. The inhabitants chiefly reside in the town of St. Anne, which occupies the * View 49."], [233, "217 CHAP.

The island abounds with springs, and excellent water can be obtained in any quantity ; but wood and refreshments, &c, are scarce. harbour of refuge in brave bav. \u2014 The works projected at Alderney, in 1847, consisted of two breakwaters, for the purpose of enclosing Braye bay, viz., a west breakwater, extending 900 yards to the eastward from Cape Grosnez, and an east breakwater, running out N.W. 400 yards from Roselle point, leaving between their extremities an entrance 133 yards wide, and open to the N.E. This design has since been enlarged, and the west breakwater now extends 1,000 yards in an E.N.E. easterly direction from the Cape, while the base, which has been brought up near the level of low water, has been carried 300 yards farther. The outer extremity of the base is marked by a black buoy, which may be approached on the north-east side without danger, but the passage between the buoy aud the end of the wall must not be attempted. The west breakwater is built over the Bouillonnaise and Malassise rocks, and the centre of it passes a cable's length to the southward of the Grande Braye rocks. The inner side of this breakwater may be apnroached within 40 yards of the wall. The effect of the work already executed shelters from westerly and N.W. gales the space within a line drawn S.E. by S. from the outer end of the west breakwater to Roselle point, including Braye road, the old harbour of Braye, and the new harbour of Craby, which last has been lately constructed, and, as before stated, is chiefly used by vessels employed bringing material for the new works. The whole of the anchorage thus enclosed is sheltered from the N.W. ; the inner part as far as North ; and the portion between the Braye rock and the breakwater is only open from E. by S., round northerly, to N.E. by E. The present leading mark into the anchorage is, the tower of St. Anne church in line with the outer end ofthe pier of old Braye harbour, S.W. A W. This is also the mark for the beacon on the Braye rock, and may be run with by vessels drawing 20 feet until within half a cable of the rock ; vessels of the above draught should not drop farther in.* The only dangers within the breakwater are the Braye rock and the Tetes Champignons. * Two fixed red lights will shortly be placed as a guide into the harbour by night. When in one, \"bearing S.W. by W. W., they will lead directly over the Braye rock, so that kejping them a little open either way will lead clear of the rock until it be blasted away."], [234, "218 CHANNEL ISLANDS ; ALDERNEY. [chap. V. The Braye Rock uncovers 3 feet at the lowest tides, and lies nearly in the centre of the space enclosed by the breakwater, N.E. E. a quarter of a mile from a white conical beacon on the outer end of the parapet of the pier of old Braye harbour. A beacon, consisting of an upright iron bar, fixed on a small tower, and surmounted by a red skeleton ball or globe four feet in diameter, divided by meridional lines, has been erected on this rock, and the top of the ball is 6 feet above the highest tides.* The Tetes Champignons are rocky patches, with only 4 feet water on their highest heads, lying W. by N. three-quarters ofa cable from Roselle point. brave harbour \u2014 The old harbour of Braye, which is situated in the western part of Braye bay and dries out at low-water neaps, has been much less frequented since the construction of the basin or new harbour of Craby, owing to its exposed position, and is becoming fast filled up with sand. It has a stone pier 26 feet high and 408 feet long;f but it affords but poor shelter in boisterous weather during spring tides, particularly with the wind between S.S.W. and N.W., which, although off-shore, causes a greater swell or run on the north shore of the island, and consequently in the har bour, than any other, even though right in ; and which, between high water and half-ebb, increases the surf so as to render a safe passage into the harbour doubtful. At these times the sea used to break all across the entrance, as well as quite over the pier-head, and fell with great force on the decks of the vessels within, causing at the same time so great a flux and reflux as often to snap the cables by which they were secured to the shore. This event, however, only used to happen in a gale of wind between S.S.W. and N.W., and during the spring tides ; but since the con struction ofthe breakwater, the sea is said to cease to break in the harbour. directions. \u2014 The best time to enter Braye old harbour is on a rising tide, between half-flood and high water, there being then less run than at an}' other period whatever, and 8 feet water will be carried between the beacons, which are placed on the two ridges of rocks on each side of the entrance, and just without the pier-head. Each of the beacons has a circular eye on its top. No leading mark is required, but the pier-head should be rounded as close as possible. CRABV harbour was constructed by Government in 1850 in the creek called Little Craby bay, between the old harbour of Braye and Cape Grosnez. In addition to the shelter of the breakwater, this harbour is itself protected by two small piers, one extending S.E. by E. 240 feet from the Grosnez side, and the other N.W. by N. 90 feet from the Braye side of * This rock and the Champignons are shortly to be lowered to 4 fathoms at low tide. t View 50."], [235, "CHAP. V.] 219 BRAYE AND CRABY HARBOURS. the creek, leaving between the pier-heads an entrance 40 feet wide, open to the N.E. Thus enclosed, the harbour is 100 yards long from west to east, and 90 yards wide, and affords 230 yards of quay room on its northern, western, and southern sides, sufficient to berth 4 colliers ofabout 150 tons burthen. The harbour dries out to the pier-heads at low-water ordinary springs, but it has been excavated smooth at the bottom, and has 13 feet alongside the quays at high-water ordinary springs, and 8 feet at ordinary neaps ; at half-tide there are 9 feet between the pier-heads. There is a considerable run into the harbour during S.W. gales, and less during those from the eastward and E.N.E., which last blow into the entrance ; but both are diminishing as the breakwater advances. The approach to Alderney on all sides, except the north, is rendered extremely difficult and dangerous, from the numerous rocks with which these quarters are infested, some of which are always above and others under water ; and these dangers are greatly augmented by the peculiar set and velocity of the tides. Among the rocks to the north-westward are the Burhou and Ortach group, already noticed in page 212. To the south westward and southward are the Pierre au Vrach, Etats. Noires-Putes, Coquelihou, Boni, and the Etart. To the north-eastward are the Aiguillons, the Grois, the Ledge, the Plate, the Sauquet, the Homeaux Florains, and the Hommet-Herbier, from which projects that very dangerous reef called the Brinchetais, and outside of which is the Blanchard. The tide runs over all these rocks with great rapidity. DANGERS on NORTH and N.W. SIDES of ALDERNEV. \u2014 The Clanques, the Cariole, the Barsier, the Corbet, the Grosse, the Jumelles, and the Grande Braye rocks border the south-eastern side of the Passe du Singe or Monkey channel, which separates the Burhou group from Alderney. The cianqnes are three high rocks attached to the western shore of Alderney by a rocky ridge which uncovers at low water ; the two nearest the land have been levelled and a small fort built upon their summits. A wooden beacon stands in rear of the fort on the south-eastern head of the Clanques, and when in one with the white conical beacon on Torgee hill is one ofthe marks for the Pierre au Vrach rock. Dangerous patches extend to the distance of a quarter of a mile north and west of the Clanques. Corbet Rock lies half a mile to the northward of the Clanques, and N.W. by W. \\ W. half a mile from Torgee point, and is never wholly covered, though at very high springs it is sometimes awash. It is attached at low water to Alderney by a dangerous ledge of rocks, and the ebb as well as the flood stream runs over this ledge with great rapidity. A large fort has lately been erected on Torgee point."], [236, "220 [chap. V. CHANNEL ISLANDS ; ALDERNEY. The long western mark for the Corbet is the north-eastern light-house on the Casquets just seen open to the southward of the Ortach, W.N.W. westerly ;* and the southern extremity of the Casquets just shut in with the south end of the Ortach, will lead to the northward of the Corbet and through the narrows of the Singe. Between the Corbet and the east end of Burhou the streams rush with great velocity, and during a weather tide the sea breaks nearly across the Passe du Singe ; the smooth water then is mostly found near the Corbet. The Grosse, a large prominent rock 8 feet above high-water springs, is steep-to and may be approached to half a cable's length. It lies E. by S. distant 4 cables from the Corbet, with the north-east corner of Torgee sort in line with Mouriaux house, S.S.E. The Jumelles are two small ridges of rock, which uncover at half-tide, lying about E. i S. 8 cables from the Corbet, and 4 cables to the northward of Saline bay.f They are dangerous to vessels coming from the westward with a flood tide, but the tower of'L'Etoc fort kept open to the northward ofthe outer end ofthe breakwater (the part completed in 1858), or in one with Braye rock, E. by S. S., will lead to the northward. The summit of the Braye (seldom covered) in one with beacon staff at end of breakwater, also leads to the northward, and clears two patches of 8 and 2-\\ feet, lying between the Jumelles and Braye rocks; the latter patch of 2.V feet is named the Galle. Grande Braye Rocks are a group of four heads, the outermost of which seldom covers, though awash at high-water springs ; the three others, called the Follets, show at half-tide. The outer Braye lies N.E. by E. 3 cables from the tower of the new fort on Cape Grosnez, and a cable from the middle of the breakwater.

Grois Ledge is an extensive dangerous reef, lying off L'Etoc point; it extends 3 cables between the bearings of N.N.W. and N.E. from the tower of the new fort on that point, which should not be approached on these bearings within half a mile. The rock called the outer Grois, the highest of the reef, is awash at high-water ordinary springs, and bears N. by E., distant 1 \u00a7 cables from the tower of the fort. Several of the heads show at half-tide, and many more at low water. The stream rushes over this reef with great velocity. The depth is 13^ feet at a cable's length to the W.N.W. of the outer Grois, but the mark that leads to the northward of the Aiguillons will clear it. Plate Rock lies S.S.E. 2 cables from the outer Grois, and uncovers 4 feet at low- water springs. From the rock, the tower of L'Etoc fort is in one with the Ortach, W. byN. -J N., and the high rock, named Bon Ami, on the east side of Corbelets harbour, in line with old Corbelets barracks, S.W. The ground between the Plate and the outer extremity of the Grois reef is foul, and should not be approached by any vessel. The Ledge, or Fosse de la Band, is a reef of considerable extent, with 15 feet over it at low water.

Since the commencement of the breakwater in Braye bay it has been nearly discontinued as a harbour, in consequence of the greater safety of the bay, and as this will be more so as the breakwater advances, it will never be resorted to except in a case of great emergency. It is now well fortified, but there are the remains of a strong fortifica tion on the heights above Longy, formerly called the Fort, which, together with the block-house, were built by the Earl of Essex during the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and display the masonry of those times ; there are also new barracks. Fronting Port Longy there is an islet, named Hommet de Longy, connected to Alderney by a causeway of large irregular-shaped stones, which dry at 2 hours ebb. The entrance to the port is not more than 2 cables wide, with a rock right in the fair-way which dries at low-water great springs, and, as both ebb and flood set violently across the harbour's mouth, it is very difficult as well as hazardous to attempt. The following directions only refer to small coasting vessels well adapted for taking the ground, and although they appear simple, the entrance should never be attempted by a stranger. directions. \u2014 The best time to enter Port Longy is with the wind between N.W. and S.W., and between 2 and 5 hours ebb ; a vessel can then run aground, and on the succeeding tide she may be hauled up under Essex Block-house, on the sandy beach at the western side of the bay.

The greatest attention, however, must be paid to the inclination of the wind as well as the tide in every instance. The latter anchorages are to be preferred to Longy road, on account of the ground, as well as from the known duration of an easterly gale when it sets in during the winter season. But, as the sea will seldom hurt a good ship when properly managed, gaining sea-room is on all occasions to be pre- ferred in bad weather to anchoring on the coast of Alderney, unless under peculiar circumstances ; and the tides, if skilfully managed, will generally enable a vessel, as long as she can carry close-reefed top-sails, to hold her own. It may also be remarked that the wind, against which the former anchorage holds out shelter, will, on a south-western stream of tide, prove a fair wind for Grouville or St. Catherine bays, in Jersey; and that the wind against which the two latter are recommended will always prove fair for Guernsey roads, if the anchorage in Braye road within the breakwater cannot be reached. directions.\u2014 When bound to Alderney from the north-east, in hazy weather it will be prudent to obtain a bearing of Cape de la Hague, when a vessel may stand boldly for the north-east end of the island; but should the weather be so thick that it cannot be discerned at the distance of 3 miles, neither the Cape or the island should he approached within that distance to avoid the outlying rocks. When nearing the Cape or the island, the tides must be carefully considered. In clear weather, a vessel may stand direct for the island.

Having passed the Etats, the next danger is the Corbet rock, between which and the Etats lie the Barsier and Cariole rocks ; to avoid which, do not shut in the Orbouee rock with the Etats, until the south extremity of the Casquets is just shut in with the south end of the Ortach bearing W. byN. f N., or until the summit of the high land at the Mount is just open to the northward of Cape Grosnez E. by S. f S. When abreast the Corbet, which should not be approached within a good cable's length, nor Burhou island within 2 cables, steer for the outer most high rock of the Grois ledge, or keep the tower of L'Etoc fort open to the northward of the outer end of the breakwater, E. by S. -| S. ; this will lead clear of all danger on the north side of Alderney, until the tower of St. Anne church comes in line with the white patch on the outer end of old Braye pier, S.W. i W., the leading mark into Braye road within the breakwater. At Night, the Casquet lights open to the northward of the Ortach will lead to the northward of the Corbet and through the narrows ; and those locally acquainted can safely use this mark in the darkest night, provided the weather be clear and the high land not obscured at the west end of Alderney, for although the' Ortach may not be visible, yet the moment of its eclipsing the lights will be easily seen. When bound to Alderney from the south-eastward, be careful, when approaching the east end of the island, to keep the Coquelihou rocks their apparent breadth open to the southward of the Etart rock, W. \\ N.,* to avoid the Blanchard bank ; and as no mark can be given for rounding this bank, do not go nearer the island than ll miles.

Along the southern side of the island, between the Orbouee rock ancl the Hommet de Longy, there are 9 hours of eastern and but 3 of western stream. The former stream commences one hour before low water, and runs along the land towards Longy during the whole flood, and until 2 hours ebb again; in the neighbourhood of which, meeting with the south western stream from the Race, it suddenly veers and unites with it. The latter stream commences at 2 hours ebb, and sets towards the Orbouee for 3 hours, or until 5 hours ebb, at which time it joins the south-western stream from the Passe du Singe. There is also an in-shore stream on the northern side of the island, between the Corbet and Sauquet rocks, and within or to the southward of the vortex of the Singe, running 9 hours to the westward and only 3 to the eastward ; the former stream commences one hour before high water, and the latter at 2 hours flood. These two streams are exactly the reverse of each other. The following description of the set of the streams around Alderney is from Mr. Maj-, Resident Engineer for the Breakwater works : \u2014 \"The general ebb stream of the English Channel, running westerly on clearing Cape de la Hague, finds an opening to the southward, and sets through Alderney Race in a S.W. direction with great velocity. On reaching the east end of Alderney, it is diverted into its original direction of West, parallel to the northern shore of the island, until it again meets with the opening of the Passe du Singe, through which it rushes S.W. westerly. The same process is repealed on clearing the rocks at Burhou, and the SAV. stream runs through the Casquet channel. This stream begins to run at 3 hours ebb, and continues until 3 hours flood on the shore, and its direction is nearly uniform. Tliere is but little time of slack water; and on the cessation of the S.W. stream, the N.E. stream of the flood tide takes place, with still greater velocity, from 3 hours flood to 3 hours ebb on the shore. The velocity of the N.E. stream through the Race and Singe is 7 to 8 knots per hour at great springs ; and of the S.W. stream, 6 to 7 knots. The general Channel stream above described as running parallel to the north coast of Alderney, does not approach within half a mile of the land, and between it and the shore there exists a separate stream, caused by the obstruction of the island, known as the in-shore or shore tide, the periods of which are different. This stream, commencing at the Homeaux Florains, the inner passage ofthe Grois, the Aiguillons, the end of the breakwater, the Jumelles, &c, sets westerly from 44 hours flood, during the whole ebb, until one hour"], [245, "229 CHAP. V.] TIDES. RACE OF ALDERNEY. flood again on the shore, being 9 hours, and after a few minutes of slac water runs easterly the 3 remaining hours of each tide. The westerly stream on the shore, thus commencing 4i hours before the westerly stream in the offing, is distinct from the offing stream, although gradually drawing off and blending with it when the latter begins to run; The shore stream is that which will affect the entrance of the new harbour in Braye bay, wherever it may be placed, because, although the end of the pier is already nearly as far from the shore as this stream formerly extended, the effect of the work has been to throw it off; and the end of the break water now occupies the same relative position to it as Cape Grosnez did ten years ago. The shore stream runs 3 to 4 knots at springs, and produces an over fall off the Aiguillons on a weather tide. A counter stream exists on the southern side of the island, setting easterly nine hours out of the twelve ; commencing at 5 hours ebb, drawing off to and uniting at half-flood with the N.E. stream through the Race. On a shore so indented with creeks as that of Alderney, it is difficult to describe the innumerable streams and eddies that run, but the general rule appears to be, the nearer the shore the earlier they commence to take their different directions ; a knowledge of this will be of great service to coasters, for by attention to it they will nearly always command a stream favourable to their destination.\" race of alderney.\u2014 Between Alderney and Cape de la Hague is the strait called the Race of Alderney, or Raz Blanchard ; the stream in which, when running to the south-westward during spring tides, has been found to exceed the rate of 6^ knots, and during the neaps nearly 5 knots. The north-eastern stream runs with even greater rapidity, and it is said that a large cutter, when in the Race, did not alter her position, although running 8 knots with an easterly wind against the stream at high-water springs. The greatest strength of the north-eastern stream continues about 2 hours, that is, from one hour before the time of high-water at Alderney, until one hour after; and the greatest strength ofthe south-western stream about 21 hours, beginning 5 hours after high water at Alderney and ending 4^ before the following high water. In boisterous weather, if the wind and stream are ever so obliquely opposed, the sea breaks in all parts of the Race, as if it were over small knolls or patches, which makes it difficult and often dangerous, especially for small vessels to pass through, but nowhere, however, will less than 26 fathoms water be obtained. The stream in the Race is in some degree connected with those of the Great Russel and the Deroute channels, that is, between the"], [246, "230 [chap. v. CHANNEL ISLANDS ; ALDERNEY. period of half-ebb and low water, and of half-flood and high water, the south-western stream from the Race running directly into and through the Great Russel and the Deroute, and the north-eastern stream from the latter channels running into the Race. A similar union exists between the streams in the Singe, Ortach, and Little Russel channels ; between the periods only, however, of three-quarters ebb and one-quarter flood, and between three-quarters flood and one-quarter ebb. The stream in the Race, Singe, and Casquet channels, that is, in their immediate drafts, begins to set to the south-westward at half-ebb exactly by the shore, and runs in that direction for 6 hours, or until half-flood, and the contrary with respect to the north-eastern stream, for there is neither high nor low water slack there. The first 2| hours of the south-western stream in the Race, that is, from half-ebb till low water, sets W.S.W., and the last 2 hours, that is, from low water till half-flood, sets S.W.; and the contrary for the first and last 3\u00a3 hours of the north-eastern stream, which between half-flood and high water sets very strongly round Cape de la Hague.* The velocity of the north-eastern stream in the Race, during the springs, exceeds 7\u00a3 knots; and that of the south-western stream is 6^ knots per hour. The neaps do not exceed 5\\ knots. directions. \u2014 When running through the Race of Alderney with a leading wind, either way, it is best to steer in mid-channel, bearing in mind that the north-eastern stream, between half-flood and high water on the shore, sets very strongly round Cape de la Hague, off which there projects several sunken rocks. The direct course from the Race to the Little Russel channel is W. b. S. \u00a3 S., and from the Casquets to that channel nearly S.W. 1 S. If bound therefore from the Race or Casquets to the Little Russel, between the periods of low water and half-flood, and of high water and half-ebb, allowance must be made for the stream, which obliquely crosses the courses during these periods, and great care must be taken to avoid the Milieu rock and the Schole bank. banc de la schole lies nearly in the direct line between the Great Russel channel and the Race of\" Alderney, and great care must be taken to avoid it when running or beating down the Race to the south-west ward for the Great Russel.

There is also a knoil of very small extent lying about 9 miles to the eastward of Sercq, the long western mark for which is St. Martin point (Guernsey) in liue with the Bee du Nez (Sercq). When the streams run strong it is easily perceived; but otherwise it is difficult to be traced. As there are not less than 20 fathoms water upon this knoll, it is consequently not dangerous; no marks have therefore been given for avoiding it. OVSTER ground About 11 miles in a north-easterly direction from La Coupe point, the north-eastern extreme of Jersey, and nearly 14 miles in a south-eastern direction from the telegraph on Sercq, lies an extensive oyster ground, the marks for which are as follows, viz., the island of Jethou in one with Bee du Nez (Sercq), Roselle mill in line with the Burons de Dirouilles, and the two high Heads of the Pierres de Lecq in one with Cape Grosnez. There is, however, little or no difference to be observed with respect to the various depths of water in its neighbourhood. JERSEY. \u2014 The form of this island is that of a parallelogram, its greatest length from east to west being about 8 miles, and its greatest breadth from north to south about 5 miles.* By a singular contrast with the island of Guernsey, the declivity of which is towards the north-west, Jersey declines towards the south-east, and to this circumstance may pro bably be attributed the pre-eminence which the latter enjoys in the richness of its productions and the luxuriant appearance of its surface. This island, like Guernsey, is in the diocese of Winchester, and is divided into twelve parishes, each parish having its own church, the spires of which serve as the principal land marks. The natives speak both French and English, and the population according to the census of 1851 amounted to 57,155, showing an increase of 9,599 in ten years. Ship-building is carried on with great success, ancl some of the finest and fastest vessels have been built, averaging from 1,000 to 2,000 tons burden. The total amount of shipping belonging to the island in 1857 was 381 sailing and 2 steam vessels, measuring 36,398 tons, and employing 4,000 seamen. The commerce of the island is large, its staple trade being to New foundland for the cod fishery, and a large direct trade with Brazil. Nearly all the necessaries of life are imported, chiefly from France and England. * See Admiralty Charts, Jersey, No. 62 ; scale, m =2 inches : and Cape Carteret to Cape Freliel, No. 59 ; scale, m=0*6 of an inch."], [249, "233 CHAP.

The chief imports are, beer, cattle, coals, eggs, flour, poultry, potatoes, pigs, sheep, spirits, tea, wheat, wines, and timber; of the latter there was imported during the year 1857 (exclusive of timber from North America, Sweden, Norway, and the northern ports) 2,522 loads of oak, 3,302 pieces of oak, 767 pieces of fir, and 22,754 deals, the greater proportion of which was used in ship-building. The exports are, apples, bricks, butter, cider, cows and heifers, grapes, oysters, pears, ancl potatoes. Jersey possesses several good bays or roadsteads ; St. Aubyn bay, however, on the southern side of the island, is the best both for capacity and convenience, and affords excellent anchorage in from 3 to 5 fathoms water, muddy sand , with long grass and sea-weed.

AUBYN BAY. CHAP. V.] 237 ST. aubyn bav. \u2014 The whole of the anchorage in this bay, though surrounded on every side by rocks, is free from any ground capable of damaging a vessel's cable, and is sheltered from all winds but those from S.S.E., round southerly, to W.N.W., and partially even from them. South-westerly gales from half-flood to high water send in a heavy rolling sea; but in proportion as the water falls the sea subsides, the rocks in the offing greatly contributing to break its force and effect. St. Heiier, the principal town on the island, is situated in the north eastern side of this bay. The little town of St. Aubyn, with its castle, which gives its name to the bay, stands on the western side, opposite to St. Heiier, their distance from each other being about 21 miles. Both these towns have stone-pier harbours, wherein vessels lie aground at low water upon a soft muddy sand, the tide receding nearly 2 cables farther out. There is also a strong mole-head projecting from the northern side of St. Aubyn castle, forming a sort of basin in addition to that of the pier, where vessels frequently refit and unload, grounding, however, at low water. Elizabeth castle is built on a cragged rock on the eastern side of the bay, about a mile to the south-westward of St. Heiier, and is 98 feet above the level of the sea. On the spot where it now stands was once an Augustine monastery, built in honour of St. Heiier, a recluse, whose hermitage is still extant. Elizabeth and St. Aubyn castle are insulated every tide, and from their prominent positions afford shelter respectively to the two harbours, by breaking the swell which is forced into the road during south-westerly gales. ST. helier harbour. \u2014 The old pier or Inner harbour of St. Heiier is substantial, well constructed, and capable of affording protection to large vessels that can take the ground, having a depth in it of 21 feet at high water springs, and 12 feet at neaps. It has an area of 6-5 acres, with an opening 270 feet wide facing the N.W. The Inner harbour has lately been enclosed by additional piers extending out to low-water springs, constructed from the designs of Mr. James Walker, C.E., between the years 1841 and 1850, at a cost of .\u00a3170,000. The area of this Outer harbour is 14 acres; ancl the entrance, which also faces the N.W., is 160 feet wide. It carries a depth in the lower part, of 36 feet at high-water springs, and 21 feet at neaps. At half flood tliere is about 16 feel depth between the pier-heads ofthe Outer harbour, and 5 feet between the pier-heads of the Inner harbour.

E. of Albert Pier light ; and a red light from the lantern-post on the Upper Pier road, 680 yards to the E.N.E. of Victoria pier light, at an elevation of 46 feet above high water; the three latter lights are visible from the distance ofabout 3 miles. WATER.\u2014 The winds which occasion the greatest swell and surf in St. Aubyn bay are those between S.S.E. and W.N.W., but particu larly the latter, when there is no safe landing between Rocomont and St. Aubyn castle. With the wind in any other direction, water may be procured by the vessel's boats ; but owing to the rapidity with which the tides rise and fall, added to the shallowness of the beach, the boats employed upon this service can seldom make more than one trip during the same tide ; and the experiment of rafting casks is here attended with great risk, unless during the summer. In bad weather from the south westward and westward, it will always be prudent to land on the western side ofthe bay, as there will then be a certainty of again reaching the ship. OUTER and INNER DANGERS in ST. AUBYN BAV The principal dangers to be avoided in going into St. Aubyn bay are, the Hubaut, with a long ledge to the southward of it; the Grunes; the Sellette; the Fours ; the Grande Vaudin ; and the Grunot rocks on the western side : the Rouaudiere ; Grune St. Michel; Hinguette ; and the Demie de Pas, on the eastern side. The Pignonet, the Grune du Port, the Diamond, and the Huitriers or Oyster rocks are well within the bay. The passages among these rocks are extremely narrow, and hazardous from the rapidity of the tides ; to which may be attributed the loss and partial damage that many vessels have sustained. Hubaut, Grande, and Petite Grune. \u2014 The Hubaut, which is awash at low-water springs, lies with the western tower in St. Brelade bay in one with a large rock to the westward of La Frette point, called the Rousse, bearing N.N.E. 1 E. ; and St. Sauveur church in line with Noir mont point tower E. by N. \\ N.

The Huitriers uncover 13 feet at low water, and have a swinging beacon on them, marked in 23 divisions ofa soot each ; when the rocks are awash there are 10 feet water between Victoria and Albert piers, and by deducting the number of divisions seen above water from 33, it will give the depth between the piers.

If drawing 14 feet water, when moored, she should have St. Heiier church its own breadth open to the northward ofthe northern angle of Eliza beth castle, E. 1 S. ;* La Houle well open to the eastward of the turret on St. Aubyn castle ; and the tower on Noirmont point bearing W. by S. | S. : this is an excellent spot for holding, and affords a constant depth of 17 feet. If of 19 feet draught or upwards she should never drop farther into the bay, or to the northward, than to have St. Heiier church in sight to the southward of Elizabeth castle, nor farther to the eastward than to have the Pigeon-house of La Houle, or La Houle itself, in one with the turret of St. Aubyn castle. These precautions are necessary to prevent the heel ofthe vessel from striking at low water springs, in the event of a south-west gale of wind; and even this position would be unsafe, but that at low water there is seldom any scend or pitch of the sea. A vessel drawing 24 feet will be compelled to moor in the strength of the tide, if she intends to ride out the spring ebbs: when moored the Upper Blanc Pignon should be in line with the turret of St. Aubyn castle, and the Town-hill Signal-post between the Real and False Hermitages. Ordinary springs are here meant ; for during the equinoxes the greatest depth is 23 feet only, in this position.

Mont Plaisir house in line with the western turret or keep on St. Aubyn castle, N. 1 E., will lead directly through it, to the eastward of the Grunot and the Grune du Port, and to the westward ofthe Rouaudiere, to the anchorage in St. Aubyn bay. The Rouaudiere lies nearly in the fair-way of this passage, though consider ably within the outermost rocks, but the shallow part being small it may be avoided with common precaution. The Eastern Passage, between the Demie* de Pas (on which there is a beacon, and which uncovers 20^ feet at low water) and the Hinguette rocks, which uncover 10^ feet, is rather more contracted, from the obliquity of the leading mark, than the Middle passage, though the water is equally deep.

There are channels on both sides of Elizabeth castle leading into the Little road ancl St. Heiier harbour, but they so abound with rocks, scat tered on all sides, that the utmost caution is requisite with a large vessel to avoid them. When bound from the bay into the Little road or Inner harbour, with moderate weather, it is best to weigh about half-flood, at which period there will be 16 feet water in the Little road, and 6 feet between the p-ier-lieads at three-quarters flood ; the depth increases to 31 feet in the Little road, and to 21 feet between the pier-heads, at the highest springs.

The best method of mooring in the Little road, for a vessel of not more than 12 feet draught, is to shackle one bower cable to a mooring buoy that has been placed there, so that in case of ne cessity she can be moored with the other bower, and ensure a safe position in the event ofa sudden shift of wind. The buoy lies in 4^ fathoms in the middle ofthe road, with the pier-head in line with Gouray church, and fort Henry midway between Gouray church and mill, W. N.

DANGERS in grouville BAV. \u2014 The most prominent dangers in Grouville bay are the Naxico, the Ecureuil, the Guillemots, and the Equerriere, with its outlying rocks in the northern part; the Burons, with many others, to the westward near the shore ; the Noire, Grande Haisse, Giffard, and the Frouquies de Greve, in the southern part ; and the Chateau banks to the eastward ; the latter lie exactly in the fair-way when running for the anchorage from the southward or eastward, and the whole, with many others which dry at low water, form as it were a complete shelf of rocks, which extends a great distance into the sea. The Naxico uncovers 8 feet at the lowest tides, and is marked by a floating beacon. The Ecureuil uncovers 15 feet, and has a fixed beacon. The Guillemots, lying S.W. a third of a mile from the Ecureuil, uncover 9 feet. The Equerriere or black rock, is the highest rock in the bay and uncovers 34 feet ; it is marked by a fixed beacon, and though often awash, seldom wholly covers, and is therefore used as a leading mark to clear the Fara and the rocks in its vicinity. The Burons uncover 13 feet, and have a floating beacon. The Noire uncovers 16 feet. The Grande Haisse, 25\\ feet.

The Pillon is a small head with only 4 feet over it at low water, lying a quarter of a mile to the eastward of Verclut pier-head. The Fara is a large flat rock lying, with many others, directly athwart the mouth of St. Catherine bay, and appears at half-ebb. The same marks which lead to the eastward of the Pillon will also lead to the eastward of the Fara, as well as over the shoalest part of St. Catherine bank, which has only 2 fathoms water on it at the lowest tides ; and to avoid the rocks lying to the northward and south eastward of the Equerriere, do not approach it nearer than 3 cables' lengths when rounding it on the eastern side, in order to enter Grouville bay ; or keen La Coupe point just in sight to the eastward of Verclut point, until the beacon on Little Seymour rock (lying to the westward of Seymour tower) is just visible to the westward of Seymour tower, S.S.W. W., which will clear the Fara ledges, and lead direct to the anchorage. The Equerriere rock in one with the northernmost of the Five towers,* S.W. by W. 1 W.., will also lead in the fair-way between the Chateau banks and the Fara ledges, till within 3 cables of the Equerriere, the distance prescribed for rounding that rock when entering the anchorage. Entering Gouray Harbour, run between the Equerriere and the Ecu reuil, on which there are beacons, for the entrance, rounding the pier head at a sufficient distance to prevent collision, and placing the vessel according to her draught. But as the passage between the Equerriere and Ecureuil is seldom used, being too contracted and leaving no room for a vessel to cross the tideway to gain the pier, bring Gouray church its breadth open to the south-west of the pier-head, N.N.W. ; this will lead to the northward of the Burons, to the southward of the Ecureuil, and direct into the harbour. If alter the period of half-flood at springs, be careful, as the stream sets with great force round the pier-head to the northward. Sharp vessels not provided with legs should always get a pier berth, and list in, assisted by their mast-head tackles on shore, to prevent their falling over at low water. The bottom consists of a hard sandy mud, with the exception of one patch of soft mud in the harbour. During the severe gales in winter a vessel will strain less in taking the ground, be much better sheltered, and will experience far less scend in this harbour than in any other in the Channel islands. Tliere are 6 feet at the pier-head at half-flood at springs, and when the Frouquies de Greve are covered, which will be soon after, a vessel can enter the harbour and take a berth as convenient. directions for southern entrance. \u2014 When proceeding from St. Aubyn bay to Grouville bay, it will be necessary to pass through the * View 62."], [270, "254 [chat. v.

The northern breakwater has been carried out 826 yards in a south-easterly direction from Verclut point, the northern extremity of the bay, and over the rocky bed named the Pierre Mouillee, and has 5 fathoms at the outer end at low water. It was completed in 1855, and forms an admirable pier with a lofty parapet, alongside of which a steamer might coal, water, land or embark troops, with ease in any wind from N.N.E., round westerly, to S.W. The southern breakwater was designed to extend in an E. \u00a3 N. direction from the point near Archirondel tower, and to be carried out over the Basses de Fara. Of this about 200 yards, as far as the tower, is built; the remaining 1,400 yards are not yet begun. From the end of the south breakwater a kant of 400 yards was to be carried towards the outer end of the north pier, leaving an entrance between, 700 feet wide, facing the East. In addition, the rocky heads within the piers were to be blasted away. When completed (which sooner or later there can be little doubt but that it will be), the sheltered area to the low-water mark will be about 300 acres, of which 50 acres will have upwards of 3 fathoms over it at low-water springs ; an invaluable refuge on these coasts, where all are tidal harbours. light. \u2014 A light tower (an octagonal structure of iron, painted white, and 30 feet high from base to vane) stands on the outer extremity of the parapet wall of Verclut pier or breakwater. It exhibits a. fixed white light, dioptric and of the fifth order, at 60 feet above the mean level of the sea, and visible from 10 to 12 miles off. Dangers in Bay. \u2014 The principal dangers in St. Catherine bay at present are, a range of rocks to the southward and south-eastward, under the general name of the Basses de Fara ; a sunken rock on the northern side of the entrance, called the Pillon, with 4 feet on it at low water, and lying about a quarter of a mile to the eastward of the pier-head; and also a rock nearly in the middle of the bay, with 6 feet on it at low springs. The Fara and the Basses de Fara appear at half-ebb. St. Catherine bank lies about a quarter of a mile to the eastward of the outer edge of the Fara, ancl its length, in an E.N.E. and W.S.W. direction, does not exceed three quarters of a mile. It is composed of coarse sand and yellow gravel, is steep-to on both sides except the western, which is united to the foul ground to the eastward of the Fara. The shoalest part of the bank is near the north side, and has only 12 feet water on it at the lowest tides.

As Gouray road affords no shelter with southerly winds, trading vessels bound to Gouray harbour, during strong winds from that quarter, and not able to save their tide in, may anchor under the break water until two hours flood, when they would still carry sufficient southerly tide to enable them to reach the road by the time they would have water into the harbour. No vessel, however, should remain at anchor in this bay longer than a tide for fear of a sudden shift of wind to the S.E. or N.E., which would place her in a precarious position. The bottom is composed of hard sand, and quite free from any foul ground, with the exception of the Brayes, a small group of rocks extending a cable's length from La Coupe point, and the Coupe bank, with 4 fathoms on it, which lies exactly in the entrance ofthe bay. Anchorage. \u2014 Coming from the northward, Mont Orgueil castle, well open to the eastward of Verclut point S.S.W. 5 W., will lead between the Brayes and the Coupe bank; and coming from the eastward, Roselle wind mill in line with Fliquet tower, N.W. by W. \\ W. will lead between the Pillon rock and the bank. The best anchorage in Fliquet bay, with southerly or south-westerly winds, is in 7 fathoms water at 3 cables from Verclut point, ancl midway between the breakwater and the Coupe bank, with Nez du Guet ancl La Coupe points in one, N.W. by W., and the mortella tower on the hill to the northward of Mount Orgueil castle in line with the centre of the breakwater, S.W. by S. With westerly' winds, anchor nearer La Coupe point, about the centre of the bay. roselle bav lies between La Coupe and Nez du Guet points, and being exposed to all winds between S. by W., round easterly, and N.W. byN., vessels never remain at anchor in it longer than to await water into the harbour. With the exception of the foul ground off the points of the bay, there is only one danger to avoid, the Hiaux, which uncovers 4 feet at the lowest tides, and lies exactly in the fair-way of the anchorage, and also of tbe harbour, with Roselle hotel in line with the white patch on the pier head, W.S.W. havre du roselle. \u2014 This small but useful harbour, situated at the bottom of Roselle bay, has a stone pier capable of affording shelter to 20 small cutters, such as are employed in the oyster fisheiy.

Gouray harbour is far preferable in every respect. The navigation of this harbour is much obstructed by a large flat half-tide rock, lying on the south side of the entrance, not leaving a greater space between it and the pier-head than to allow two small cutters to enter abreast. If this rock were removed, or three or four buoys. similar to those at Gouray, were laid down, it would save much time, and greatly facilitate entering this harbour, as vessels arriving or leaving with a foul wind are obliged to kedge in or out. directions. \u2014 Approaching Roselle bay from the northward, and intending to enter the harbour, keep the battery on the west side of Boulez bay open to the northward of the Tour de Roselle, N.W. by W. 1 W., until the Royal hotel at Roselle comes in sight to the southward of the white patch on the pier-head, W. by S.-|S., which mark will lead to the southward of the Hiaux, and to the entrance of the harbour. Give the pier-head a close shave, to avoid the half-tide rock. If the tide should not serve to enter the harbour, the best anchorage will be found in the north-west side of the bay, with the Royal hotel in line with the white patch on the pier head, W.S.W., and the lower and the upper part of the wall of Nez du Guet fort in one, or the two chimneys of the guard-house in the fort in one. boulev bav, on the northern side of Jersey between Belle Hogue point and Tour de Roselle, affords good shelter against any wind between W. by N., round southerly, and S.S.E. The only dangers in this bay are three patches of rocks called the Troupeurs, the Sambues, and the Grune du Vicart. The Troupeurs lie near the middle of the bay, and the most northern head has 3 fathoms water on it, and the inner head only 13 feet ; the marks for the former are, the two high heads of the Pierres de Lecq just touching the land at Belle Hogue point, N.W.

This bank, lying about E.S.E. 4 cables from the little white watch house on La Coupe, and N. by E. nearly half a mile from the eastern end of the north arm of the breakwater, has 4 fathoms on it at low water and 7 fathoms around it. Give the Tour de Roselle a berth of at least a quarter of a mile, and then round into the bay for the position recommended for anchoring. giffard and bonne nuit bavs.\u2014 On the north side of Jersey, between Belle Hogue point and Cape Grosnez, are situated the bays of Giffard, Bonne Nuit, St. Jean, Greve de Lecq, and Greve au l'Anchon, but as they are all open to the northward, no sailing vessel should attempt to remain in them, even with off-shore winds, longer than a tide; for should the wind veer and blow strong from any point between jjS.E., round northerly, to W.S.W., she would be in a perilous position. The Pierres de Lecq and the Dirouilles assist in a measure to break the force of the heavy sea caused by northerly winds. If from any cause a vessel is obliged 'to remain at anchor in either of these bays for a night, the sails should be double-reefed, and everything ready to weigh or slip. Giffard and Bonne Nuit bays lie between Belle Hogue and Fremont points, La Crete point dividing the one from the other. Giffard bay is nothing more than a cove ; the bottom, however, is clean, and the only danger in it are the rocks, extending a cable's length to the westward from Belle Hogue point. Bonne Nuit bay, to the westward of Giffard bay, is a great resort for smugglers, and may be easily recognized on nearing it by St. Jean barracks, a long range of buildings facing the north, also by Montmado windmill, which stands directly over them.

Anchorage The best anchorage is under the high land of Belle Hogue, at about a quarter of a mile from La Crete point, in from 8 to 10 fathoms at low water, over a sandy bottom. A vessel will be here well sheltered from south-easterly, southerly, and south-westerly winds, but she must be prepared to weigh and slip in case of a sudden shift of wind to the northward. ST. jean bay, situated between Fremont and Rond-nez points, is but a slight indentation of the coast, and can be scarcely called a bay; it has, however, a moderate depth of from 6 to 8 fathoms water in it. The exten sive quarries on this part of the island, give the coast a barren appearance ; no vessel, unless well acquainted, should approach it nearer than half a mile in order to avoid the rocks lying midway between Fremont and Rond-nez points at 2 cables' lengths from the shore ; these rocks uncover 16 feet at low-water springs, ancl with those that lie the same distance off Fremont point, are the only dangers in the bay. greve de LECdJ bay, the most spacious bay on the north coast of Jersey, lies between Rond-nez ancl Pleinmont points, and its position may be recognized from a distance by a whitewashed mortella tower standing in the centre of a large sand}- beach on its west side. Between Sorel point and the centre of the bay are several rocks, some of which lie more than 2 cables off shore, and near the head of the bay is a small rocky group, named the Demies, which lie N. f W. 3 cables from the mortella tower, and uncover 19 feet at the lowest tides. There is a small sandy cove, called Sorel bay, between Rond-nez and Sorel points, affording shelter to boats from easterly winds.

Strong westerly winds send in a heavy sea. ST. ouen bay, on the western side of Jersey between Cape Grosnez and La Corbiere point, affords excellent shelter against easterly and south easterly winds in from 8 to 15 fathoms water; but in consequence of its exposed situation, it is only resorted to for the purpose of stopping tide. The only hidden danger in entering this bay from the northward is a dangerous shoal called the Rigdon (described in page 235), lying W. N. 2 miles from Cape Grosnez. There is a Swatch-way between the Rigdon and the extensive ledge of rocks projecting from Le .Tac point, but it is scarcely safe for the passage ofa large ship at low water. After rounding Cape Grosnez, and bound to the southward, or, if bound to the northward, a vessel may at half-flood pass between the Rigdon and the land by keeping the high heads of the Pierres de Lecq half a point open to the westward of Cape Grosnez, bearing E.N.E. ; this mark will lead through at a suitable distance to the westward of the rocks off Le Tac point, and when the Corbiere rock bears S.lE. haul in for the anchorage. Anchorage. \u2014 The marks for the best anchorage in St. Ouen bay are, St. Pierre steeple in line with the fourth mortella tower on the beach, counting from the northward, bearing E. by S. f S., and far enough to the eastward to have the Pierres de Lecq shut in to the eastward of Cape Grosnez, the latter bearing about N.E. \u00a7 E. A vessel in this position will be in 15 fathoms water, over a bottom of coarse sand, with small shells. ST. brelade bay, on the south -western side of the island between La Frette point and the Corbiere rock, is small and much contracted by the dangers in its vicinity, and is not capable of receiving vessels of a greater draught than 16 feet, and even these are not safe with southerly winds, to which the bay is quite exposed ; the ground is, however, remark able for holding. A fort, named Beau Port battery, mounting six guns,"], [282, "266 [chap. V.

There are two rocks almost immediately in the fair-way of the entrance, namely, the Fournier du Port on the western side, and the Fruquiers on the eastern ; their distance asunder not much exceeding 3 cables' lengths. The Fournier du Havre rock lies within, or to the northward of the anchorage, and uncovers 18 feet at the lowest tides. The Fruquiers uncover 10 feet, and appear about 4 hours ebb ; and the Fournier du Port soon after, and uncovers 11 feet. There is also a ledge of rocks one-third of a mile in length, called the Aiguillons, lying to the south-eastward of La Moye point, with 4 fathoms between it and the shore, and 7 fathoms close to its south eastern side above a quarter ofa mile off-shore. If circumstances prevent a vessel from reaching St. Aubyn bay, it would be advisable to anchor out side the Fournier du Port in 7 or 8 fathoms with the Aiguillons in one with the Corbiere, N.W. W., and Picton's hotel just open to the eastward of the westernmost land, N.N.E. 1 E., where the shelter will be found equally good.* western Pass. \u2014 There are two passages into St. Brelade bay : one between the Fournier du Port and the Fruquiers, called the Middle pass ; and one to the westward of the Fournier du Port, called the Western pass. Prospect lodge, nearly its length open to the eastward of a large rock named the Goulet, lying on the west side of the bay, N.E. by E. \u00a3 E., will lead through the Western pass between the Grosse Tete and the Fournier du Port, until the high land of La Moye comes in one with the Grosse Tete, N.W. by W. \\ W., then haul to the eastward, and when Picton's hotel opens ofthe Goulet, N.N.E. 1 E. let go the anchor and the vessel will be. as near as possible in the middle of the anchorage in 3 fathoms water.

No vessel should drop farther into the bay than this to avoid the Fournier du Havre, should the wind veer to the southward. Castle house is a square white building, the front facing the bay, and stands a little higher than Pic-nic hotel. The hotel is a long white house with two windows on either side ofthe door, and with a black roof. Both these houses, with Picton's hotel, may be easily distinguished one from the other by the colour of their roofs, and they are the only white buildings in this part of the bay ; Pic-nic hotel is the westernmost of the three. portelet bay is between La Frette point and the rocks which lie to the westward of Noirmont point, and which contract the bay so much that they render the approach within it inaccessible to vessels even of the smallest size.

Burney, Master of H.M.S. Dasher, who has had much experience amongst the Channel islands, may be found useful when approaching Jersey at night, or in thick weather :\u2014 \" It cannot be too deeply impressed on the mind of the mariner when approaching the Channel islands at night, or in thick hazy weather, the necessity of taking regular and careful soundings, the neglect of which has led many vessels into great danger, with the loss of valuable lives. Since 1847, or within the last 10 years, at least thirty vessels, some of large ton nage, have been saved in an almost miraculous manner from being wrecked on some ofthe dangerous reefs lying between Jersey and the French coast (and many have been totally wrecked, frequently with the loss of all hands), having passed between Jersey and the coast of France, also between Sercq and Jersey, and through some of the most intricate passages, without knowing their position, many thinking they were at the entrance of the English Channel, and others, that they were abreast the Isle of Wight ;"], [284, "268 [chap. v*. CHANNEL ISLANDS ; JERSEY. whereas, if they had made proper use of the lead, the depth of water is so correctly laid down in the Admiralty charts of these islands that with common attention no vessel could possibly get into difficulty. The lead, however, will be found of little or no use when navigating the different narrow passages leading into St. Aubyn and Grouville bays, and it is only those who are well acquainted with the locality, and the numerous sunken dangers, that could with safety conduct vessels through them. From the Northward Having made Cape de la Hague light, enter the Race of Alderney as near mid-channel as possible, and from thence steer S.S.W. 1 W., or S.W. by S. (making proper allowance for the set ofthe stream, which if between the period of half-ebb and half-flood on the shore will be running to the south-west), so as to get a bearing of Sercq. This island should always be sighted when approaching Jersey at night or in hazy weather, to ensure giving a good berth to those dangerous rocks, the Dirouilles and Pierres de Lecq, which have proved fatal to so many vessels. If bound to an anchorage on the eastern side of Jersey, when the east end of Sercq bears N.N.W. 3 or 4 miles, steer S.S.E., to pass midway between the Pierres de Lecq and Dirouilles. When Cape Grosnez bears W. J S., or Cape Carteret light E. 1 S-, the vessel will be to the south-east of the Pierres de Lecq, and a South course will lead into Bouley bay. Should neither the land nor Cape Carteret light be seen, but having previously sighted Sercq, ancl brought the east end to bear N.N.W. distant 3 or 4 miles, steer S.S.E. 8 miles, ancl then South, keeping a good lookout, and the lead quickly hove, and the vessel will be running in a direct line for Bouley bay, but on no account approach the land to a less depth than 10 fathoms, to avoid the Sambues off Belle Hogue point. No vessel should run as close as this without being ready to anchor at the shortest notice, and if from the state of the weather she is prevented doing so, never approach the land nearer than 4 or 5 miles, or come within the depth of 18 fathoms at low water to avoid the Pierres de Lecq and Dirouilles. When proceeding to the eastward of Jersey at night in clear weather, on no account bring Cape de la Hague light to the northward of N.E. 1 N. until Cape Carteret light is to the northward of East to avoid the Dirouilles, but if from the state of the weather it should be more prudent to heave to, by keeping Cape de la Hague light between the bearings of N.E. and E.N.E., Cape Carteret light between S.S.E. and S.E. b. E., and the Casquets between N.W. and N. b. E., a suitable distance will be pre served from the French coast, Alderney, Sercq, and the Schole bank, and the vessel will be in a fair way to proceed at daylight, either to the eastward or westward of Jersey."], [285, "269 CHAP, v.] DIRECTIONS. Great attention, however, must be paid to the soundings when lying to, as the streams run with great velocity, and the French coast should not be approached within the depth of 15 fathoms, Alderney or Sercq 18 or 20 fathoms, and the Schole bank 10 fathoms. Should the wind be between N.E., round easterly, and S.E., shelter will be found in Vauville bay in 10 to 7 fathoms, with Cape Carteret light just open to the westward of Cape Fiamanville S. W., and Cape de la Hague light just open to the westward of the Nez-de-Jobourg N. by E. |- E., or closer in with the lights shut in, but do not approach the Nez nearer than 3 miles, or within the depth of 15 fathoms, to avoid the Huquets de Jobourg. If bound round the west side of Jersey to St. Aubyn bay, steer the above course S.S.W. 1 W. on S.W. by S. from Alderney Race, and pass at least 3 or 4 miles to the eastward of Sercq to avoid the Blanchard rock. When the west end of Sercq bears N. b. W. the vessel will be to the westward of the Pierres de Lecq, and should haul in about S. by W. to make Cape Grosnez^ If unprovided with a pilot, stand off and on between the Cape and the Corbiere rock, taking care not to approach the land between the Cape and Le Tac point nearer than 3 miles or within the depth of 16 fathoms to avoid the Rigdon shoal. When Le Tac point bears E. b. S. the vessel will be well to the southward of the Rigdon, and if the weather will admit, or if the wind is from the eastward, she may stand into and anchor in St. Ouen bay in from 16 to 7 fathoms. In rounding the Corbiere at night or in thick weather, the speed of the vessel should be sufficiently reduced to enable the leadsman to get quick and regular soundings. If when standing towards the Corbiere the depth of 12 fathoms is obtained without seeing the land, and the weather will not allow of anchoring, run off 4 or 5 miles to the westward and lie to until daylight, or if the weather is thick, until it clears sufficiently to see the land, but on no account allow the vessel to be driven to the southward, for the streams at the springs run with great velocity and the whole of the flood sets to the south-east. Many vessels that have hove to oft\" the Corbiere during a long night, without paying proper attention to the set of the streams, have drifted upon the Minquiers ledge, and become total wrecks. From the North-west. \u2014 When bound to the eastward or to the westward of Jersey from Guernsey, or from the northward or westward, it will be advisable to make Cape Grosnez as it is bold-to, and by keeping the land aboard, a vessel will ensure clearing the Pierres tie Lecq and Dirouilles, and may reach any of the bays on the east side of the island ; but should the weather be thick on nearing the Cape, or the night too dark to make the land out, do not approach within the depth of 15 fathoms, in which position"], [286, "270 [chap. v. CHANNEL ISLANDS ; JERSEY. she can anchor until daylight or until it clears, if it is not blowing too hard or the sea is not too high. From the Westward Running for Jersey from the westward always endeavour to sight Guernsey, so as to give the Douvres ledge a good berth (page 372), and in dark or thick weather do not come within the depth of 38 or 40 fathoms, as the soundings to the westward of Guernsey and this ledge are very similar, and a vessel during a strong spring-tide may be drawn into difficulties. From the S.W. \u2014 Approaching Jersey from the southward and west ward, when in the vicinity of the rocks between the Hubaut and the Hin guette, lying off St. Aubyn bay, great attention must be paid to the lead, never going within the depth of 10 fathoms until the position of the land is correctly ascertained. A vessel may anchor here and ride in safety except during westerly gales, when she would be exposed to a heavy sea. From the S.E. \u2014 If bound to Jersey from the southward or eastward and passing through the Anquette channel, keep the lead quickly hove, which at night or in thick weather will be the only guide. When in the neighbourhood of the Anquettes and the B\u0153uf, if the water shoals suddenly the vessel is nearing the Anquettes; if it deepens suddenly, she is to the northward of the B\u0153uf; if 14 or 15 fathoms be obtained, the anchorage in Grouville bay will bear about W.N.W., and between the periods of half-ebb and half-flood, she can run in and anchor in 7 or 8 fathoms. At night in clear weather, the light on Gouray pier may be seen 5 or 6 miles off, and when it bears N.W. the vessel will be to the northward of the Anquettes. From the Eastward. \u2014 When running from the eastward towards Jersey, having passed between Cape Carteret and the ficrehou rocks, with the light at that Cape bearing N. b. E. distant 10 miles, Mont Orgueil castle will bear W.N.W. 10 miles, and the vessel will be in the fair-way to pass between the rocks and the B\u0153uf patch, and by steering W.N.W. it will lead to the northward of the Chateau banks either for St. Catherine or Grouville bays. After running 7 or 8 miles on the above course, if the land is not seen on no account go within the depth of 8 fathoms, or the vessel may with safety anchor till daylight, as the ground between the Anquettes, the Fcrehou, and the B\u0153uf, is good for anchoring on. If the light on Gouray pier is seen, bring it on a N.W. bearing, and it will lead clear of all danger to the anchorage in Grouville bay.\" tides around Jersey.\u2014 It is high water, full and change, all around Jersey, at 6h. 10m.; great springs rise 42 feet, ordinary springs 36 feet, and neaps 19-J- feet.

In Grouville and St. Catherine bays the stream between half-ebb and half flood runs to the southward, and to the northward between half-flood and half-ebb, and the same in St. Ouen bay, with a velocity in each at the springs of 4|r knots, and at the neaps of 2\\ knots: the streams will consequently meet at the four principal extremities of the island, viz., La Coupe point, Cape Grosnez, La Corbiere point, and the Conchiere rock. About 2 miles W. by S. from La Corbiere point it runs as follows : from low water till one-quarter flood, S. by W. ; from one-quarter till half-flood, S.S.E.; from half-flood till high water, S.E. and N.E. (one branch going to the southward of the island, and another to the westward through St. Ouen bay) ; from high water till quarter-ebb, N. by E. ; from one quarter till half-ebb, N.N.W.; from half-ebb till low water, N.W. : the velocity here is about 4 knots during the springs and 2 during the neaps. The stream 2 miles northward from Cape Grosnez runs as foilows : from half to three-quarters ebb, W.S.W. ; from three-quarters ebb to low water, S.S.W.; from low water to half-flood, S. and S.E. by E. (one branch, as at the Corbiere rock, going through St. Ouen bay, and another to the north ward of the island) ; from 3 till 4 hours flood, East; and from 4 till 5 hours flood, E.N.E. ; from 5 hours flood till high water, N.E. ; from high water till 2 hours ebb, N.N.E. ; from 2 till 3 hours ebb, W. by S. ; and from half-ebb as before : velocity, about 4 knots at the springs, and 2^ at the neaps. The streams in Le Ruau channel, between La Coupe point and the Ecrehou rocks, run fair both ways, viz., from 5 hours flood till 5 hours ebb the stream is N. by W., and the contrary from 5 hours ebb till 5 hours flood ; the velocity during the springs being about 5 knots, and that of the neaps at least 3. The streams in the neighbourhood of the Conchiere rock run with great rapidity, and produce great spoutings and overfalls. Their velocity during the springs, in a north-eastern and south-western direction, is about 6 knots, and at the neaps about 4 knots. The flood stream generally sets about N.E. into St. Aubyn bay ; more to the northward as the head of the bay is approached, and more to the eastward as it is receded from, so as to be about East in the neighbourhood of the Sellette rocks. The ebb runs in a contrary direction, and between Elizabeth castle and Mont aux Pendus (Gallows hill) the last quarter-flood sets to the N.W., and thence round the head ofthe bay towards St. Aubyn"], [288, "272 [chap.

The position where the meeting of the streams takes place previous to their separating, one part towards the north-eastward and the other towards the south- eastward, seems to be between the above two stations. The former position is in the southern indraft, between Jersey and the Douvres ledge, while the latter station is in that between Jersey and Guernsey. By keeping Sorel point ever so little open to the northward of Pleinmont point the latter influence will be ensured; and by opening the land at La Frette point to the southward of the Corbiere rock the former will be obtained, provided that on both these occasions St. Martin point (Guernsey) bears nearly N.E. |N.; a knowledge of this division ofthe stream may on many occasions have its use. It must not, however, be supposed that the positions given above for the meeting of the streams remain always the same, for in proportion as the south-western stream between Sercq and Cape Grosnez slackens, so this HOURS OF THE TIDES.

By the above principle also will the confluence of the streams at the four principal points of Jersey be governed, and vary from one to three points ofthe compass as the mass of water on either side preponderates. tides south of jersey. \u2014 It has been already stated that along the southern shore of Jersey the stream runs, according to the trend of the land, 6 hours and 6 hours each way ; but between the Minquiers ledge, and the island it assumes a more north-westerly and south-easterly direction, as will be seen in the following Table. Nor is there any north-eastern inclination of the flood-stream in the offing between the Minquiers and the island, to the westward of a supposed straight line drawn from the eastern extreme of the former to Ikhot tower ; but the stream continues to the south-eastward until high water, and on the first of the ebb sets directly North. In nearly a similar manner does the stream run between the Deree and the Corbiere rocks, save that the flood runs rather more to the eastward, and the ebb more to the westward. The mark for the above division of the stream appears to be the Tour d'Auvergne in one with St. Clement church. The following tables will give the set of the streams to the southward of Jersey : \u2014 At Maitre isle (Minquiers) the spring tides, on some occasions, rise and fall 46 feet, and run with a velocity of 7 knots ; but the ordinary rate of the springs is 6 knots, and of the neaps 4. The set of the streams about 10 miles W. by N. of the Deree rock, (St. Ouen just appearing to the eastward of the Corbiere,) and to the eastward of a supposed straight line drawn from Cape Frehel to the Roches Douvres, inclines principally to the north-westward and south-eastward.

GENERAL REMARKS on the TIDES in the VICINITY of the channel islands From what has been said in the preceding pages, it is evident that the streams in the neighbourhood of the Channel islands are never quiet, but have a constant rotary inclination, the ebb and flood in some parts blending with each other and running together, and in other places the reverse. In the offing, between the Casquets and Guernsey, and between Guernsey and Jersey, the first half of the flood-stream, that is, the rising water, runs to the southward and south-eastward, and continues so to run until the water has risen 3 hours by the shore, or half-flood ; although in the Race of Alderney, the Singe and Casquet channels, the Great and Little Russels, the Deroute channel, and in St. Catherine, St. Ouen, and Grouville bays, it continues more or less to run to the south-westward until that period, making what is termed tide and half-tide with the shore. At half-flood the stream in the former case runs more to the south- eastward, and in the above-mentioned channels it sets to the north- eastward and northward ; thus having progressively veered from south to north-east during a space of three hours only. At half-ebb the whole body of water between Cape de la Hague and Brehat isle sets to the westward and south-westward, as well in the several channels above- mentioned as in the offing; thus having occupied 6 hours in rounding the compass between the periods of half-flood and half-ebb. After half-ebb the stream gradually inclines more to the southward, setting South at low water as before, thus completing its circuit from one low water to another in the space of 12 hours. The time of low water is, on an average, 6 hours after that of high, but during a series of moderate weather, the water occupies 5% hours in rising and 7\\ in falling. The stream in the Race of Alderney, when running to the south westward, is found between the periods of three-quarters ebb and one quarter flood to exceed the rate of 6\\ knots ; and in the Passe du Singe, when running to the north-eastward, to attain the rate of \"i\\ knots.

The peculiar set of the stream in the offing between the Casquets and Brehat isle, running to the southward in the neighbourhood of the former, and to the south-eastward in the vicinity of the latter, powerfully operates in accelerating the course of the water towards the coasts of Bretagne an Normandy, particularly in and about Cancale, whither at low water the tide naturally endeavours to concentrate from all points of the compass between the north and west, subject, however, to be influenced in its progress by the conformation and position ofthe islands and shoals. The water thus accumulated in the vicinity of Cancale, and hemmed in by the obstructions which Jersey ancl the rocks present to its attempt at egress, raises the level there to a very considerable altitude above that at Alderney ; which, from a comparison of the difference in the vertical rise on springs, appears to be 8\u00a3 feet, supposing the surface of the water level in both places at the period of half tide. The first discharge from this great accumulation of water (the ebb) being regulated by the conformation of the coasts of Normandy and Bretagne, forms a very strong line of current towards the Race of Alderney, particularly as the stream continues to press to the eastward in the offing some time after high water ; and as the limits for its passage become more and more contracted in proportion as it advances northward, its north-eastern velocity must be in a like proportion increased ; and this impulse will continue until the level of the channel to the eastward of Alderney preponderates and reverses the stream, which appears to take place at the periods of half-ebb at Alderney, and of 5 hours flood in the Strait of Dover. The trend of the land between Cherbourg ancl Cape de la Hague, and the oblique situation of Alderney, produce upon the south-western stream quite a contrary effect, for the ebb stream from Cherbourg preserves a great proportion of the north-western course, communicated to it by the concave trend of the coast between Cherbourg and the Cape, and conse quently part of it will of necessity be carried round by the northern side of Alderney. Again, the ebb stream has free egress down the English Channel, which, while it affords a greater scope forthe distribution of water, will evi dently decrease the pressure for admittance on the northern side of the Race. The rapidity with which the tides rise and fall, and their velocity, are greatly influenced by strong north-eastern and south-western gales of wind ; the former retarding and the latter accelerating their progress in a very remarkable degree : the latter will also cause the Race stream to run three-quarters of an hour longer to the north-eastward than it other wise would do, though the former has not that effect upon the stream when running to the south-westward. t 2"], [292, "276 [chap. v*. CHANNEL ISLANDS. In the application of these and other remarks to the regular tides, it is therefore of great importance, in so contracted a space, that the force, direction, and duration of the wind should be taken into the account ; these being found to vary the tides considerably in the duration of their periodical courses. Even the soundings, however correctly they may have been ascertained, are found to undergo great alteration. Generally speaking, a gale of wind between N.W. and W.S.W. sends in a heavier sea among the islands than the wind from any other quarter, to the formation and increase of which the tides greatly contribute. The greatest sea is generally about high water, and it gradually subsides after half-ebb. The tides put in and take off in all this neighbourhood very suddenly, and the general run of the springs takes place about half an hour sooner than that of the neaps. If a vessel should happen to be near the islands during a long winter's night, but to the westward withal, the following observations may be worth consideration. With northerly, north-westerly, and westerly winds, it would not be prudent to lay her head to the north-eastward, between the periods of low water and half-flood, unless the depth of water exceeds 34 fathoms, because during that interval the wind and tide unite in driving the ship to the south-eastward ; it is equally imprudent with southerly, south-westerly, and westerly winds, to lay a vessel's head to the south-eastward between half-flood and high water, for the same reason, the wind and tide contribut ing to drive her to the north-eastward; with all easterly winds, the islands become a weather shore, and may consequently be made free with as dis cretion may point out. Further : a position or departure taken before dark may, by attention to the set of the streams, be preserved within 3 or 4 miles, provided a vessel can car^r close-reefed top-sails and sore-sail, as what may be lost on one tide will be nearly regained on the next, if the wind will enable her to lie across either. This calculation may be made with a degree of certainty off St. Malo, Granville, and Cape Flamanville. The space between the island of Guernsey and the Casquets, is a track which has been recommended for expedition ; but this can only apply to the following periods, viz., between half-ebb and low water, and between half flood and high water, when to the eastward of the Schole bank; and between three-quarters ebb and one-quarter flood, and three-quarters flood and one-quarter ebb, when to the westward of that bank ; and in both cases leading winds will be ner*-ssary, for on a comparison of the tides it will appear that in every other case the stream obliquely crosses the course be fore the beam, unless in the actual draught of the Race or channels west ward of Alderney, and in consequence it is rather an obstacle than other-"], [293, "CHAP. V.] 277 TIDES wise, unless during the periods above quoted ; at all events it cannot be deemed an auxiliary except on those specific occasions. It has been already stated, page 273, that the streams 10 miles W. b. N. from the Deree rock, with St. Ouen church just open eastward of the Corbiere, and to the eastward of a line drawn from the Douvres ledge to Cape Frehel, set principally to the north-west and south-east, viz., from low water until half-flood, South ; and between high water, and half-ebb, North ; and from half-flood till high water, S.S.E., and N.N.W. from half-ebb till low water. Many pilots, however, French as well as English, believe that the first of the flood runs to the south-westward into St. Brieuc bay. The injurious effects of this opinion, so .contrary to fact, will be parti cularly felt by a vessel obliged to lie to with a westerly gale during a long winter's night, from want of daylight to enter St. Malo or St. Aubyn, between the periods of low water and 5 hours flood, when not certain of the particular position ofthe vessel as to the parallel she may be on, or, in other words, as to her relative distance between Jersey and Cape Frehel. For after making all fair allowances for the heave of the sea, drift, loss of ground in wearing, &c, a vessel guided by the above opinion may be deceived as to her real position during the above interval from 9 to 12 miles of easting or westing, an error which is inadmissible when within the narrow limits of such a navigation.

The dangerous rocks off the Cape, as well to the westward as to the northward, and the breakers, which may be discerned almost a mile from the shore, render it prudent for a stranger never to shut in Rosel point -with Cape Flamanville,* unless the Ortach rock, or the Casquets, are open to the northward of Alderney, particularly during the north eastern stream and a westerly wind. The best plan is to endeavour to keep as near as possible in the middle of the Race of Alderney. With easterly winds Cape Carteret guard-house may be substituted for Rosel point, if clear of the Trepieds or Huquets de Jobourg.-f- From Nez-de-Jobourg a precipitous coast, formed by cliffs of equal height, extends S.E. 4 miles as far as the sandy beach bordering Vau ville bay. These cliffs are intersected by narrow and deep valleys, and their foot is bordered by rocks, which in some places extend 3 cables' lengths into the offing. The tops of the hills adjoining the coast are at about the same elevation as the Nez, and they unite by a gentle rise with the highest land, upon which, at 1| miles E. by S. of the Nez, stands Jobourg church. The Nez-de-Jobourg is surrounded by a sort of rocky barrier, which extends out a mile in a N.W. direction from the Nez, and terminates in the westernmost of two rocky flats, named Basses de la Dossiere, upon whicli tliere are only 9 feet at low water. The Dossiere rock lies 4 cables' lengths to the northward of the Nez, and uncovers 16 feet. It is the highest rock of the barrier, and the local pilots make use of it as a half-tide rock, as it covers about the time of half-flood on the shore, at which time the flood stream begins to be felt in Alderney Race and around the Nez. The Greniquet rock, (page 5,) in one with the low point of Cape de la Hague leads close to the westward of the foul ground offthe Nez. * Views 82, 124. j See Admiralty Charts, Cherbourg to Cape Carteret, No. 58, scale, m = 0 \u2022 6 of an inch ; and North Coast of France, Sheet X, St. Germain to Barfleur, No. 2,669, scale, m = half an inch."], [295, "279 CHAP.

'HUQUETS DE JOBOUKG. huquets de jobovbg is the name given to a rocky range lying parallel, and about 1^ miles from the shore, between the bearings of S.W. and S.S.E. from the Nez-de-Jobourg. It extends rather more than 2 miles in a S.E. and N.W. direction, and the highest heads on it are named Basses St. Gilles, Huquets de Jobourg, and Huquets de Vauville. Basses St. Gilles are three rocky heads, and on the highest, at the north-east point of the above range, there are only 7 feet at low water. The western head, with 19 feet on it, lies at the western extreme of the range; and the third head, a small isolated rock with 5 fathoms on it, lies a quarter of a mile to the southward of the 7 feet. Rosel point seen opening of Cape Flamanville, S. i E.,* leads 6 cables' lengths to the west ward of the western head ; and the lighthouse at Cape de la Hague in one with the summit of the Greniquet rock N.N.E. \u00a3 E., leads a quarter of a mile to the eastward of the 7 feet head, and midway between it and the Huquets de Jobourg.

Two small rocks, named the Calenfriers, lie upon the north-west part of the reef, and uncover 2 feet. Huquets de Vauville lies a third of a mile to the eastward of the Huquets de Jobourg, and forms the eastern extremity of me range. This reef is of small extent, and the highest head on it, whicli uncovers 15 feet at the lowest tides, is considered a half-tide rock by the pilots, who, when they are waiting in Vauville bay for the most favourable moment to cross Alder ney Race, weigh when its summit is about 2 feet above water, and gain an offing in order to pass to the westward of the St. Gilles. caution*. \u2014 The flood stream begins to gain strength when the Huquets de Vauville and the Dossiere rocks are covered, and runs with great rapidity' towards the dangers just described, as well as over the rocky barrier sur rounding the Nez-de-Jobourg ; a sailing vessel, therefore, entering the channel which separates the Huquets de Jobourg from the coast is liable to be drifted upon this barrier, unless the wind is favourable, and sufficienfly strong to ensure her stemming the stream. * View 124."], [296, "280 [chap. ti.

The anchorages most free from the irregularities with which the ground along this coast abounds are, Vauville bay, Sciotot bay, Port Bail, St. Germain road, and Regneville road; but the three latter can be used by small vessels only, as there are not more than 2\\ or 3 fathoms in either at low water. The harbours along the coast all dry out at 2\\ hours ebb, and vessels begin to sue at about one hour ebb. anse de vauviue, formed between the Nez-de-Jobourg and Cape Flamanville, affords good shelter against all winds from South, round easterly, to N.E., in from 4 to 12 fathoms over a bottom of fine hard sand. This bay is much resorted to by merchant vessels and coasters overtaken by a calm, or unable to save their tide through the Race of Alderney, or for want of water to proceed to the southward over the flats lying to the southward of Cape Carteret ; but they should be pre pared to weigh and gain an offing if the wind veers to the westward. When the wind blows off shore, and particularly from the S.E., there is a heavy surf on the beach, which renders landing impossible ; but at the distance of a mile from the shore the sea is smooth, and there is but little swell. At the head ot '.he bay, between Vauville and Siouville, which are distant from each othei 4^ miles, the shore at the foot of the high land is low, and covered with sand hills. The coast for 2\"*, miles to the south-east of the Nez-de-Jobourg is bordered by rocks as far as 3 cables' lengths from the shore ; the most dangerous are the Huitriere, the Sidnian, the Foraine, the Brequets, and the Ronde.

With the wind between East and South the best shelter will be found under the high land of Cape Flamanville on the south side of the bay ; in rounding that Cape, however, from the southward, care must be taken at night to avoid the foul ground off it, which may be done by keeping Cape de la Hague light in sight to the westward of the Nez, or not to stand into less than 10 fathoms. When leaving this anchorage to enter the Race, weigh when the summit ofthe highest rock of the Huquets de Jobourg is about 2 feet above water, that is, at half or three-quarters of an hour before the commencement of the flood stream, to profit by the last of the ebb and the slack water to pass outside that reef and the St. Gilles ; neglecting this precaution, there is danger of being drifted between the Huquets and the shore, where the rapidity of the stream and the badness of the bottom render anchoring impossible, and of being carried upon the rocks off the Nez, where the stream runs with great violence. PORT de bielette. \u2014 This little tidal harbour lies in the southern part of Vauville bay at 2 miles to the north-east of Cape Flamanville, and is sheltered from N.E., round easterly, to S.W. by the high land, and from S.W., round westerly, to North by a stone pier, 174 yards long and 6J feet above the level of high-water springs, which also protects it against the furious effects of N.W. gales. It will admit vessels of about 10 or 12 feet draught at the springs ; but the entrance is so surrounded by rocks that access to it is hazardous to strangers, except at high water and with a leading wind. The entrance to the harbour, which is 72 yards wide and open to the N.N.E., is comprised between the head of the pier and the extreme of a little pile of loose stones on the steep shore of the eastern part of the harbour. The sand at the entrance dries 16 feet above the level of the lowest tides, and from thence the bottom of the harbour, which is composed of sand and gravel, takes a gentle ascent up to the level of high-water neaps. The best position to ground is about two-thirds the length ofthe pier from the pier-head, but as the bottom is hard, every precaution must be taken to prevent the vessel from falling over. In gales between West and North the hatchways should be battened down, for the surf breaks over the pier and falls into the harbour. The channel leading to the harbour is 3 cables long in a north-westerly direction, and only about a cable broad, being narrowed by low rocky ledges, which uncover at low water a cable's length outside the two beacons mark ing it on either side, and between which a vessel must pass. These ledges are low, and cause in rough weather a heavy sea, which will be avoided by keeping in the direction of the channel. The southern beacon stands on"], [298, "282 [chap. vi.

The northern beacon is placed on a rock which uncovers 17 feet, and bears N. -J W. 3-^4 yards from the pier-head, and E. by N. i N. 197 yards from the south beacon. This rock forms the southern edge of a rocky bed joining the shore to the northward of the harbour, and which in rough weather greatly breaks the force of the sea.

The outer is a white light, 23 feet above high water, shown from the jetty head, and visible at 5 miles. The other is a red light 75 feet above high water; it stands 169 yards to the south-east ofthe former, and may be seen at 9 miles. directions. \u2014 The direction of the channel leading to Port Dielette is pointed out by the tops of two remarkable little conical hills, forming the northern boundary of the valley of Dielette. When within a mile of the port, open the summit of the hill which has the ruins of an old semaphore on it, a little to the northward of the summit of the other hill, ancl keep a sharp look out for the beacons. As soon as the beacon on the Rognouse is made out, steer to pass about half a cable to the north ward of it, and then direct for the pier-head, which round as close as possible in order to avoid the Pierre de la Riviere. With moderate winds between West, round northerly, and N.E. , the above directions can be followed by vessels drawing not more than 10 feet water, from half an hour before to half an hour after high water; but when the wind is fresh from that quarter they can only enter it at high-water springs.

Le Ruau channel between them and Jersey is 2\\ miles wide, very deep, and free from danger at all times of tide, though the confused sea is so violent as frequently to resemble breakers. The channel between this group and the Pierres de Lecq has been noticed in page 234. Les Burons are two high remarkable conical rocks lying nearly in the middle of the Dirouilles group, with St. Martin church spire open to the eastward of Roselle windmill, S.S.W. A W., and Montmado mill a little open west of La Crete point (Bonne Nuit bay), W.S.W. They should not be approached to the westward nearer than to have Roselle windmill well open to the westward of Tour de Roselle, S. by W., or Verclut point shut in by that of La Coupe,* S. | E. La Plate Rock is the south-easternmost head of the Dirouilles, and, with the protrusions to the south-east of it, forms the western side of the south entrance to the Passe de l'Etoc. It covers a little before high-water springs, but always betrays itself by breaking. The marks for it are, Roselle windmill in one with the fort on Nez du Guet point, S.W. A S., and the Burons N.W. by W. A W., distant 9 cables' lengths. La Frougaise Rock uncovers 30 feet above the lowest tides, and with several higher heads close to the north-west of it and a long ridge to the northward, many heads on which never uncover, forms the western side of the north entrance to the Passe de l'Etoc, but it is considerably to the westward of the fairway. It bears East, southerly, 7 cables from the Burons, and from it the southern head of the Burons is in one with Rond-nez point, W. \u00a3 S., the fort on Nez du Guet point is midway between Roselle windmill and the spire of St. Martin church, S.W. by S., southerly, and the Groslete rock appears midway between Maitresse and Marmotier isles, E. by N. easterly. There are several small channels and passages between the Dirouilles and the Ecrehou, and, although there is sufficient depth in them even at low water, the serpentine courses necessary to be followed render them unnavigable at that period of tide except to small craft. The principal channel is the Passe de l'Etoc. passe de L'ETOC carries from 5 to 6 fathoms water throughout, and is formed between the south-eastern end of the Dirouilles, called the Plate rock, on the western, and by the Grande Rousse, the Etoc, and the Fierco rocks on the eastern side ; there are, however, several very dangerous rocks in the fairway with as little as 2 feet over them at low water, and it should never be attempted by a vessel of large draught, except * View 78."], [305, "CHAP. VI.] LES DIROUILLES ROCKS. PASSE DE L'ETOC. 289 circumstances render it absolutely necessary. The southern entrance between the Plate and the shoal ground to the westward of the Grune du S.W., is only about 2 cables wide. Grune du s.w. lies on the eastern side of the south entrance of the Passe de l'Etoc, N.N.E. A E. 3f miles from the lighthouse on St. Catherine breakwater, S.S.E. three-quarters of a mile from the Plate, and is nearly awash at low water. When on it the highest head of the Colombier is in one with the centre of Maitresse isle, E.S.E., and the mortella tower, standing on the hill to the northward of Mont Orgueil castle, is in line with the middle of the north arm of St. Catherine break water, S.W. by S. L'Etoc. \u2014 This rock is in the form ofa saddle, appears at about half ebb, and uncovers 16 feet at low water. It lies on the eastern side of Passe du l'Etoc, E. A S. three-quarters of a mile from the Plate, and N.N.E. 5 E. 8 cables' lengths from the Grune du S.W. The marks for it are, the two highest heads of the Pierres de Lecq seen between the heads of the Burons, W. by N. A, N., and the mortella tower, standing to the northward of Mont Orgueil castle, in line with the middle of the north arm of St. Catherine breakwater, S.W. by S. Le nerco lies E. by N.

Then haul more to the northward, so as to bring the wind mill exactly in line with the new fort on Nez du Guet point, S.W. A S., which will lead clear of all danger into the northern offing. The greatest attention must, however, be paid to the above leading marks, as the proximity of the two mark objects to each other prevents them from shifting so quickly as they should do for so narrow and dangerous a passage. Another mark for this channel is, Seymour house (a large yellow building with green shutters, and a flag-staff in front of it, standing on Gouray hill, and in this direction is the only house with a flag-staff visible in that locality) touching Verclut point, S.S.W. A W. There is no channel whatever between the Etoc and the Fierco, as is generally supposed. In many instances it may be advantageous, with a leading wind, to take the narrow passage lying between the Grande and Petite Rousse ; it is, however, full of small heads, making it absolutely impassable at low water, and it should only be attempted between the periods of half flood and half ebb. The tower standing on the hill to the northward of Mont Orgueil castle in line with the lighthouse on St. Catherine breakwater, S.W. A S., will lead through between the two Rousses, ancl clear of all the low heads connected with them, until the Grande Rousse rock is in line with Boulez guard-house, W. f S., or until the rock bears W. f S., when steer N. by W. to clear the foul ground to the northward of Petite Rousse. When Seymour tower is in line with Grande Rousse, S.S.W. J W., keep it so, and it will lead midway between the Fierco and the Ruquet, over the 12 feet shoal, and to the westward of the Trois-Grunes. To enter this passage from the northward, bring Mont Orgueil castle touching the east side of the Grande Rousse, S.W. A S., and run with this mark on until tbe Burons (Dirouilles) are about their own breadth open to the northward of the Plate rock, N.W. by W. f W., then steer direct for the Petite Rousse until the mortella tower, standing on the hill to the north ward of Mont Orgueil castle, is in line with the lighthouse on St. Catherine breakwater, S.W.

Les basses de taillepied. \u2014 These shoals lie nearly midway be tween the Ecrehou rocks and Cape Carteret, and with the Feles banks form one bank, occupying a space 4 miles long in a N.W. and S.E. direc tion, and about 2 miles broad. The Taillepied lie on the west side of the Feles, anu extend 2f miles N.N.W. and S.S.E., and are 3 cables broad. They are composed of from 20 to 25 rocky heads, the highest of which"], [307, "LES BANCS FELfiS. CHAP. VI.] 291 lies on the northern part of the chain, and uncovers 2 feet at the lowest tides; the other heads have from 1 to 14 feet on them at the same period. The marks for the rocky head of 8 feet lying on the north extreme of the chain, S.W. A W. 4^ miles from Cape Carteret, are, Roselle windmill (Jersey) just showing to the southward of the south point of Maitresse isle (Ecrehou), W. by S., and Mabire windmill in one with the eastern slope of the hill of Cape Carteret N.E. by E. A E. ; Mont Or gueil castle (Jersey) in line with Maitresse isle S.W. by W. westerly leads to the northward of it in 3 fathoms at low water. The marks for the rocky head of 9 feet on the southern end of the chiin are, Pleinmont point (Jersey) open to the northward of Rond-nez point, W. by N. A N., and St. Pierre steeple well open to the eastward of Cape Carteret, N.E |- N. ; Roselle windmill in line with La Coupe point, W. by N., leads three-quarters of a mile to the southward of the south end of the shoals. Les bancs feles, lying to the eastward of the Taillepied shoals, are composed of coarse sand and shingle, and form about 20 small narrow parallel ridges, averaging about 3 cables in length. Tlie ridges lie close together, nearly at right angles to the flood and ebb streams, and occupy a spice 2 miles long in a N.W. and S.E. direction, ancl half a mile broad. Three of the ridges dry at the lowest tides, and tliere are from 2 to 4 feet over the remainder at the same period. The north-west extreme of the Feles, which has a patch of 13 feet on it, lies S.W. by S. 4-j^y miles from Cape Carteret lighthouse, and S. by E. the same distance from the Trois-Grunes ; the south-east extreme, which has an 8 feet patch on it, lies S. f W. 5-/$ miles fro.n the lighthouse. Cape Flamanville just open and shut with Cape Carteret, N. E., leads very close to their south-east extreme, and the steeple of Port Bail between the mills of Catelet, N.E. by E. \u00a7 E., leads 3 caoies to the S.E. of it; these mills stand 3 cables to the eastward ofthe mill of Bien Aime. St. Martin church spire (Jersey) in line with the lighthouse on St. Catherine breakwater, W. by N., leads to the south-east of the Ecreviere, Taillepied. and Feles banks. The Taillepied and Feles form two passages, one 2\\ miles wide at low water, between the Feles and the French coast, with patches of from 6 to 12 feet in it, and the other IA miles wide, between the Taillepied and the Ecrehou rocks, with a patch of 13 feet at low water in its southern en trance ; but from the great rapidity of the streams there is generally a turbulent sea in the latter passage, even in the finest weather, and in i* '2"], [308, "292 [chap. CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO GRANVILLE. rough weather it would be exceedingly dangerous for small vessels to attempt it. The former passage is invariably used, for although the depth in it is not so great as in the latter, the leading mark is good, which the latter is entirely destitute of. aspect of coast. \u2014 Between Cape Flamanville and Cape Carteret the land near the shore is high and appears double, and from thence to Regne ville it is altogether as low, rising again towards Granville. The coast is woody, and skirted all along with a white sandy beach, and prettily diver sified villages, churches, and windmills, for the most part within a mile of each other, and which, being built of stone, assume generally a whitish appearance. The land in the interior is lofty, though somewhat irregular, alternately ascending and descending until the neighbourhood of Coutances is approached, where it assumes more regularity. These inequalities are very conspicuous between, and in the rear of, Barneville and St. Germain. The low sandy shore to the southward of Cape Carteret, and which the entrance to Carteret harbour and the Cape interrupts for about the space of a mile, recommences at the foot ofthe Cape, and extends almost in a direct line as far as Rosel point. Between the Cape and the point the coast is studded with sand hills, and those named Dunes de Hatainville are, on account of their height, very remarkable, some of them exceeding the height of the summit of Cape Carteret. Between the Dunes and Rosel point there is a small low plain, bounded to the eastward by the last line of hills from the interior. The most conspicuous objects on the land between Cape Carteret and St. Germain are, Mont Gardon, Mont Doville, and the hills of Benneville; on the first stands the village of Mont Gardon and two mills, at 3J-- miles from the sea, and N.E. 3 miles from St. Germain ; the second at 2\\ miles to the northward of Mont Gardon, and 6\\ miles to the eastward of Port Bail, has a windmill on its summit; and Benneville hill, the third, rises E.N.E. 4 miles from Port Bail, and has three windmills on it. The coast between St. Germain and Regneville trends nearly in a straight line N.N.E. and S.S.W. for 13 miles, and the shore is low and sandy, and bordered with downs. Among the most remarkable objects is Mont Huchon, situated 6 miles in the interior, to the eastward ofthe entrance to Regneville harbour aud of the western part of the line of hills which is immediately to the northward of the harbour and on which stands the village and church of Agon. This part ends abruptly with steep slopes towards the sea, and presents, when seen from a distance to the south-east, the appearance of a high Cape faeing westward."], [309, "chap, vi.] HAVRE DE CARTERET. HAVRE DE PORT BAIL. 293 Coutances cathedral, about 6 miles inland, is lofty, and may be known by its two spires or turrets, which occasionally appear like the Reculvers in Kent. The church steeple of Agon is a large square tower covered with tiles, and the little church steeple of Pirou very much resembles it. From Coutances towards Granville the interior of the country presents nearly a regular surface, which terminates at Champeaux point, a bluff and nearly perpendicular headland about 6 miles to the southward of Granville. The sandy beach bordering the coast uncovers in some places IA and 2A miles to seaward, with reefs of dangerous rocks scattered on it in all directions, which render the approach dangerous. There are several small havres or harbours, named Carteret, Port Bail, Surville, St. Germain-sur- Ay, Geffosse, and Regneville, between Cape Carteret and Granville, capable of affording shelter to small vessels of from 40 to 50 tons. Havre de carteret, situated a mile to the eastward of Cape Carteret and N.N.W. 4 miles from Port Bail, will admit vessels of from 10.V to 1 IA feet at the springs, from half an hour before till half an hour after high water. The entrance, about a cable wide, is at the foot of the steep eastern part of the Cape, and open from S.S.W., round westerly, to N.W. The ebb stream runs with great velocity out of the harbour. directions. \u2014 The channel into Carteret harbour is between two sand banks, and the mark for leading in is, Carteret steeple in line with the eastern steeple of St. Pierre-les-Moutiers, N.E. by N., which mark would suffice for following the channel if the latter steeple was not lost sight of when closing in with the land. When the mark, therefore, is hidden, steer for tbe beacons, which must be left on the port hand on entering. The north-west beacon marks the extreme of a little rocky point near the foot of the hill of the Cape ; and the second, which stands on rocky ground and marks the side of the channel, must be left about from 10 to 16 yards to the westward. havre de poet bail, the entrance to which bears S.S.E. 4| miles from Cape Carteret lighthouse, is the best harbour between Cape de la Hague and Granville, but it is only accessible at spring tides between one hour before and one hour after high water. The bottom of 'the harbour, like that of Carteret, is composed of sand, and dries between the periods of half ebb and half flood at springs. The entrance, which is not more than a cable wide, is open to the S.W., and lies between the south point of the harbour and a sandy islet, on which there is a custom-house station. This islet is from 25 to 30 feet above the level of the bottom of the harbour, and bears W.S.W. 51 cables from the village of Port Bail. To the south-east of the islet there is a bed, com-"], [310, "294 [chap. vi.

'she little river Grise discharges itself at the bottom of the harbour. directions. \u2014 The leading mark into this harbour is the steeple of Port Bail, between the two mills of Catelet, N.E. by E. f E. The berth where the tide rises the highest is on the bed of the fresh-water stream, to the E.N.E. and East of the south point of the harbour, but it is an uneasy position when it blows strong from N.N.W. ; the tide rises here from 16| to 19| feet at springs, but in running in, the lead must be kept going to avoid the bank of the stream. The best berth is about 2 cables to the S.W. of the guard-house, which stands near the shore at 3 cables to the S.S.E. of the steeple of Port Bail, where a vessel will be sheltered from all sides except from the W.N.W. ; but the tide rises about 3\u00a3 feet le\u00abs in this berth than in the preceding one. Coasters take up a position in the bed of the stream in front of the village. basses de port bail are three small rocky ledges and a small sand bank, lying in front of the entrance of Port Bail. The first, which has two rocky heads of equal height with 6 feet over them at low water, lies about a mile from the shore with Gouey church steeple seen between Port Bail church steeple and the sandy islet at the entrance of the harbour, E.|N., and Cape Carteret lighthouse N. | W. The second is a very small head, with 8 feet over it, lying W.S.W. 4 cables' lengths from the first, and S. A E. 4 mi\" es from Cape Carteret. The third ledge, with 9 feet over it, lies North 6 cables from the second, IA miles from the shore, and S. -J E. 3j miles frcm the Cape, with Omonville church steeple in line with the extreme of the south point of the harbour, E.S.E. The bank has 8 feet on it, and lies about lj miles from the shore, with Gouey steeple in one with the summit of the islet at the entrance of the harbour, E. by N. Two rocks, named the Jument and the Grande Roeher, lie to the S.W ofthe entrance of Port Bail. The first is distant l-,**^ miles from the south point of the entrance, and uncovers 11A feet at the lowest tides; and the other is li miles Irom the same point, and uncovers 14| feet. havre de surville, situated S. by E. A E. 7-J miles from Cape Car teret, is small, with a sandy bottom, and will not admit a vessel drawing more than 7 feet at high-water springs.

A W. lj miles from the semaphore on the sand hills at the south point of the entrance ; no marks can be found for this dangerous reef. havre de ST. germain-sur-ay, lying S. by E. 12 miles from Cape Carteret and N.E. by N. 4 miles from the Sac-de-Pirou rocks, will admit a vessel drawing 7 or 8 feet at high -water springs ; but a vessel of that draught will be neaped in it for 5 or 6 days. The sand banks, both inside the harbour and at the entrance, are so shifting that it would not be prudent to enter w ithout the aid of a pilot. It is well sheltered on all sides by the land except from S.W. to South, and strong winds from these quarters send in a heavy sea. The beach uncovers 1^ miles outside the entrance, and several rocks rise from it, exactly in the fairway. The highest and nearest the entrance uncovers 25 feet at the lowest tides, and is named the Cabot ; it lies S. E. 8 cables from the guard-house on the west point of the entrance, with the guard-house just open to the eastward of the old semaphore. The channel leading to the harbour is very narrow, and is formed between the Cabot and a rock, about the same height, lying 3 cables to the N.N.W. of it. The leading mark in is, St. Germain church steeple in line with a remarkable gap in the sand hills on the long and narrow eastern point of the entrance bearing, N.E. A E. When the Cabot is covered, there are 4 or 5 feet at the entrance. The Cabot forms the south-east extreme of a rocky ridge extending 1 k miles to the westward from the west point of the entrance. The southern part of this ridge is composed of rocks which do not cover during the neaps, and they are the highest between St. Germain and Cape Carteret. A sand bank, with only 7 feet on it at the lowest tides and 18 to 22 feet around it, lies 1| miles outside the ridge, and W. A N. 2A miles from the old semaphore. This little bank is extremely dangerous to coasters working along the shore, and as no marks can be given for it, they should keep from 2 to 3 miles from the land. roches du SAC-de-piRoir lie IA miles from the coast, just outside the beach which dries at low water, S.W. by S. 4 miles from the entrance of St. Germain, and H miles to the N.W. of the little harbour of Geffosse. They form the western part of a long ridge, 6 cables wide, which extends to the north-east as far as the shore ; the highest head uncovers 5 feet, and the westernmost head 4J feet at the lowest tides. The marks for the western head are, Mont Survent church steeple, which stands upon the high land 4 miles in the interior, just open to the northward of"], [312, "296 CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO GRANVILLE. [chap. VI. Geffosse church steeple, S.E. easterly ; and Bretteville church steeple open to the westward of the hill, which rises a little to the westward of the old semaphore on the west point of the entrance of St. Germain, N.N.E. A sand bank, one mile long from north to south, and half a mile wide, lies two-thirds ofa mile to the westward of the above rocks, and 2 miles from the coast, and has only from 4 to 8 feet water on it at the lowest tides. It is dangerous to vessels working close in-shore, and may be avoided by keeping to the westward of the line on which Mont Gardon church steeple is in one with the guard-house of the battery on the west point of the entrance of St. Germain, bearing N.E. i E. There are also two small sand banks, with 7 and 8 feet, water over them at the same time of tide, between the Sac-de-Pirou and the Senequet rock; in fact, at 2\\ miles from the shore, between the Senequet and St. Germain, the depth does not average more than 15 feet. havre de geffosse, situated S.S.W. 4i miles from St. Germain, and E.N.E. 3J miles from the Senequet rock, is very small and confined, and only capable of affording shelter to small fishing boats of about 10 tons burthen. The harbour is quite open to the W.N.W., and when it blows strong from that quarter, there is a nasty tumble of a sea at the entrance. CHAVSSEE-des-B\u0152UFS are ledges of dangerous rocks extending in an east and west direction, and occupying in length a space of at least 4 miles. They lie upwards of 2 miles to the south-eastward of the Anquettes, nearly 6 miles from the French shore at high water, and appear at 4 hours ebb, but some of the heads show only at low water, besides many which are always covered.

La Bergerie in line with Seymour tower,* N.W. by W.

Should a vessel find it necessary to navigate in the northern vicinity of the Chaussee-des-B\u0153ufs after half-ebb, or before half-flood (very dangerous periods), La Bergerie must be kept open to the northward of Seymour tower, and Boulez Signal-station must be kept open to the northward of Roselle mill a quarter of a point; it will then also be just open of Roselle manor-house. The Chaussee-des-B\u0153ufs and the Anquettes being on all sides beset by a great number of detached clangers, the utmost caution is necessary, when in a large vessel, to navigate with any degree of safety between them, more especially as there exists but one continuous leading mark for the passage, viz., the church of St. Pierre-les-Moutiers, on the high land tothe eastward of Cape Carteret (apparently in the middle of the village, and the only church so situated), with a very short turret, kept open a quarter of a point to the eastward of the south-eastern pitch of that Cape,| N.E. by N. ; and even this is not quite conspicuous enough, neither do the objects shift with sufficient quickness for so narrow and intricate a passage at low water. It will, however, serve when coming from the northward, between half-flood and high water, but is too far distant to be of anj' service to a stranger when entering this passage from the southward, unless the weather be unusually clear.

The proper channels will be found to lie eastward and westward of this accumulation of dangers, and are pretty clear.

They lie between Jersey and the coast of Bretagne, much nearer to the former than to the latter, and render the approach to the French coast, west of the Chausey islets, most intricate and hazardous, requiring the greatest attention and caution to avoid the numerous dangers which present themselves between Jersey and Les Caux-des-Minquiers, also between the Litter and the Chausey islets.

It is much frequented during the fishing and vraching season by small cutters from Jersey for the purpose of loading.* There are also many temporary anchorages for small vessels within and among the Minquiers, as well as passages through them at high water, and even at half-flood, though very intricate ; but it has not been found possible to give any leading marks for either capable of being understood by a stranger; and as the rocks are so completely interwoven with each other, and most of them covered at half-flood, it would require a pilot thoroughly acquainted with the tides to attempt such contracted and dangerous navigation. The most remarkable rocks that never cover among the Minquiers, also the rocks that appear soon after high water, and are useful as marks for those that are only uncovered at half-tide and low water, are, Maitresse-ile, Maisons, Haute Grune, Faucheurs, Pipette, Grand and Petit Vascelin, Figuier, Calfateurs, Blanc Roque, Deree, and Rocher du Sud. ncaitresse-Ile, the largest of the group, is about a cable long, half a cable wide, and its summit is 23 feet above the level of the highest tides. It is situated at the eastern part of the group, and has several huts on it, in which the fishermen of Jersey reside during the summer months and vraching season. There are some traces of vegetatien on this islet, but like the Ecrehou, it is quite destitute of fuel or sustenance of any kind, neither is there any fresh water to be found, except what the rain casually deposits in the interstices of the rocks. Les Maisons are three remarkable steep rocks, with yellowish heads, lying N.VV. by W. A \\y. 41 miles from Maitresse isle, at the western part of the Minquiers group. They are not quite so high as Maitresse isle, being only 15 feet above the level of the highest tides. Haute Grune lies South nearly a mile from the Maisons, and rises from the centre of a large mass of rock, connected to the Faucheurs by a rocky reef, many of the heads of which are awash at low-water springs. Its summit is 46 feet above the level ofthe lowest tides, and as it barely covers during those tides, it serves as a good mark for the other dangers. A reef, named Grunes de Norman, lies W. by S.

Various banks and shoals project also in a S.E. and South direction from Maitresse isle. There are several small channels between all these and the Minquiers, but they are hardly navigable at low water, except for boats. The safest and most frequented passage is to the north eastward ofthe whole. The northern and eastern boundary of Les Caux is steep-to, having at least 9 and 10 fathoms water within half a mile of them. Most of the rocks show themselves at low water.

St. Pierre church kept in line with the white signal-house on La Moye, N.E. by E., or St. Ouen church in one with or open to the westward of La Corbiere point (Jersey), N.E. A E., will lead a good 3 miles to the westward of their north-west extreme, in not less than 18 fathoms at low water ; the white sand under Le Tac point will also from this position be open to the westward of La Corbiere point. Or take the horizontal angle round the horizon to the eastward, between Cape Frehel lighthouse and the Maisons rocks, and between these latter again and Le Pule (the north-west extreme of Jersey) ; and so long as the sum of these two angles does not exceed 148\u00b0, the vessel will be to the westward of their north-west extreme ; but if the two angles exceed that quantity, she will be too close. The above directions must be more particularly attended to between low and high water, with light winds, because of the south-eastern direction of the stream, which sometimes attains the rate of 7 knots. Between high water and half-ebb St. Ouen church may be brought within a quarter of a point of the signal-house on La Moye, N.E. A N.; or the above angle may be increased to 162\u00b0, but no more; the vessel will then be within a mile of the rocks. On losing sight of these marks, bring the mill of Tertre Morgan (which stands inland to the southward of Cape Frehel, and is considerably elevated) open to the westward of the Amas-du-Cap Frehel rock the same distance as that large rock is westward of Cape Frehel lighthouse, S. by W. f W., and this mark will lead a mile to the westward of the west extreme of the Minquiers; and Le Grand Larron semaphore (which stands among the trees on the heights over St. Servan, and is very conspi cuous) touching the eastern end of Cezembre island,* S. by E- A E., will lead to the south-westward of the south-west extreme.

A E. This latter mark will lead between the Western Ardentes and the Min quiers, and between Chausey and the Sauvages, in not less than 4 fathoms at low water. At 2 hours' flood, however, a vessel may venture to steer towards Maitresse isle, until Seymour tower is in one with Mont Orgueil castle, or until the Tour d'Auvergne comes in one with Grouville mill, before hauling to the southward, and may at that period of tide safely calculate upon having 28 feet water at least upon and between the latter and foregoing leading marks. The soundings between the Minquiers and the Chausey isles, when not interrupted by banks, seem pretty regular; near to the latter are 6 and 8 fathoms, and the water gradually deepens proceeding to the westward. Close to the south-eastern edge of the Minquiers the depths are from 14 to 17 fathoms; but from thence it suddenly shoals to 20 feet in several places, and in others to less. Should any ofthe above leading marks be obscured by hazy weather, be cautious, when rounding Les Caux-des-Minquiers, not to haul to the south westward, to clear the Western Ardentes, until Maitresse isle bears at least W. by N., or to the northward of that bearing, and do not approach that isle nearer than 6 miles ; and in order to pass to the westward of the * Yiew 117. f View 80. x 2"], [324, "308 [chap. vt.

When working through this channel, which can be used with safety by vessels of large draught at low water, the Ardentes will be cleared by not going to the northward of the line on which Agon tower is seen open to the northward of the hill of Mont Huchon, about twice the apparent breadth of the summit of the hill. ix.es chacsey are an extensive group of little islets and rocks, of different heights and dimensions, occupying a space of nearly 16 square miles.

VI.] ILES CHAUSEY. 309 The anchorage generally resorted to by vessels of war is in Port Marie road, off the south side of Grande-He. There are several Havres within, among the rocks, completely sheltered from all winds ; the principal one, Chausey Sound, is formed between Grande-lie to the westward and the Puceau rock to the eastward ; it is, however, very narrow, aswell as diffi cult of access, and only frequented by fishermen, vrachers, and stone boats capable of taking the ground. licet. \u2014 .\\ lighthouse, 56 feet high, stands on the summit of the hill which crowns La Tour point, the south-east extreme of Grande-He, and exhibits a fixed white light, which is varied every four minutes by a red flash, the eclipses of which do not appear total in ordinary weather within the dis tance of 6 miles. This light, which is dioptric and of the third order and elevated 121 feet above high water, may be seen in clear weather at 15 miles, and renders the approach to the Chausey islets easy at night; the lighthouse, when in line with the Corbiere rock, S.E. by E. A E., shows the precise limits of the south-east part of the Minquiers ledge. Ea Corbiere is a high remarkable rock lying at the south-west extreme of the Chausey group, N.W. by W. | W. 1-^ miles from the lighthouse, and about half a mile to the southward of Meule islet. The western part of the group contains 15 or 16 islets and numerous rocks. Bane de la Corbiere, lying off the west end of the Chausey isles, and composed of sand and shells, extends I A miles in a S. by E. A E. and N. by W. A W. direction, and is about 2 cables wide at its broadest part at low water. The general depths on it are from 21 to 30 feet, the 21 feet being near the middle of the bank. From the south end, in 30 feet, the Corbiere rock bears E. J S. 7 cables; and from the 21 feet, the lighthouse is in line with the Corbiere, S.E. by E. A E. Between this bank and the isles the depths vary from 6 to 9 fathoms. La Cancalaise is the highest head of a small rocky ridge lying a quarter of a mile from the southernmost rocks of the Chausey group, in which space are several rocky patches with but from 1 to 7 feet on them at low water. The ridge is only a cable long, east and west, and the highest head at the east end uncovers 12 feet at the lowest tides, at which period a rock comes awash at the west end. The north end of the eastern Huguenan touching La Tour point, E. by S., is the mark for the highest head ; and to avoid the ridge, when rounding the south-west end of Chausey, keep the Rondes de l'Ouest in sight to the westward of the Corbiere,* until the View 119."], [326, "310 CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO GRANVILLE. [CHAP. VI. southern house on Longue isle comes well open to the southward of the above point. Basses des Cancalais, a rocky patch about a cable in diameter, is situated rather more than a cable's length E. by S. of the Cancalaise, and the highest head on its western side uncovers 6 feet at the lowest tides ; there is another head on the north side which uncovers 5 feet. Between the Basses des Cancalais and the Chausey isles, there are some rocky heads, which uncover 4 to 8 feet. Basse du Chateau, lying S.W. A W. 4 cables from Chausey lighthouse, is about IA cables long N. by E. and S. by W., and a cable broad, and carries 14 feet water on its north end, 20 feet near the middle, and 27 feet on its south end at the lowest tides. From the south end, the highest and northernmost head of the Epiettes is seen touching La Tour point, N.E. E. ; and the beacon on the Huguenan in line with the highest head of the Piliers, E. f S., leads to the southward. Roches de Bretagne lie about a cable's length to the southward of Bretagne point, and form a ridge li cables long N. by W. and S. by E., and a cable broad. The northernmost bead on the ridge uncovers 16 feet, the middle head 14 feet, and the westernmost 12 feet at the lowest tides, at which period there will be from 6 to 11 feet over the south end of the ridge. The mark for the southernmost head, 1 1-J- feet, is the beacon on the Epiettes nearly a sail's breadth open to the southward of La Tour point, E. A N. Xa Tour Patches are three rocky heads lying about 2 cables' lengths to the southward of La Tour point. The two westernmost have only 7 feet water over them at the lowest tides, and bear N. f E. and Sj.f W. from each other, distant about 50 yards apart. The easternmost head has 11 feet over it, and lies E. by S. A S. half a cable from the westernmost head. Basse des Epiettes. \u2014 This small patch, half a cable long N.N.W. and S.S.E., has two small rocky heads on it with only 3 feet water over them. The beacon on the Enseigne in line with the eastern slope of Grande-Ile, N. \u25a0*! W., leads between the Basse des Epiettes and the Tour patches. Basse de l'Xie longue is a rocky head with only 4| feet on it at the lowest tides, lying S. by W. 4 cables from Longue isle, and S.E. AS. about three-quarters of a mile from La Tour point. It bounds the south eastern limit of the S.E. anchorage of Chausey; and the marks for it are, the Conchee touching the south end ofthe easternmost Huguenan, E.

Basses du Fis-Cous and Fis-Cous. \u2014 Midway between Longue isle and the Huguenans are two dangerous rocky patches, named Fis-Cous and"], [327, "311 CHAP VI.] ILES CHAUSEY. Basses du Fis-Cous, which may be dangerous to a vessel when working along this side of the Chausey group. The Fis-Cous is about 50 yards in extent, and uncovers 9 feet at the lowest tides. It lies S.E. | E. 6| cables from the south end of Longue isle; W. f N. 7 cables from the Chapelle rock; and S.W. by WT. 3 cables from the Grand Cheval rock. A small rock, awasii at the same period, lies a cable's length to the eastward ofthe Fis-Cous. The Basses du Fis-cous is about a cable in extent, and lies W.N.W. a cable's length from the Fis-Cous. One head on the patch comes awash at the lowest tides, and there are others with but from 1 to 4 feet over them at the same time. The stone beacon on Gros Mont in line with the Tourette rock (the mark for the South-East channel into Chausey Sound), N.W., leads to the south-west of the Fis-Cous and the Basses du Fis-Cous. l.es Petits Banes are six or seven small sandy ridges, with 7 to 10 fathoms on them, lying S.S.W. 3^ miles from Chausey lighthouse, and occupying a space If miles long N.W. and S.E., and half a mile wide. They are not in themselves dangerous, but when it blows hard they cause a heavy sea, which should be avoided by small vessels. Iles des Huguenans are small islets lying on the southern edge of the Chausey group, at 2 miles to the eastward of the lighthouse, and form, with a few rocks which join them at low water, a small rocky cluster 4 cables long E.N.E. and W.S.W. They may be easily recognized, and on the summit of the largest islet is a stone pillar, which, when in line with a similar pillar on the Etat rock, N.N.E., show the western limit of the fishing grounds. The summit ofthe largest islet is covered with grass, and sheep are often sent there from Granville to graze. 3>a Conchee. \u2014 This rock lies half a mile to the eastward of the Hugue nans, on the eastern side of the Conchee passage, and its summit is about 14 feet above high-water great springs. Haute Foraine, lying E. { N. a long mile from the Conchee, is the easternmost high rock connected with the Chausey group. Its advanced easterly position renders it very conspicuous, and the Granville pilots make use of it to know the height of the tide. It uncovers 2S-| feet at the lowest tides, and when covered there are from 15 to 16 feet water at the entrance of Granville harbour. Le Tomin is a small dangerous rock lying a quarter of a mile to the south-west of the Haute Foraine, a little to the northward of the line on which the lighthouse is in one with the north point of the large Huguenan. It uncovers 17 feet, and a vessel will pass a safe distance to"], [328, "312 [chap. vi. CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO GRANVILLE. the southward of it, and also the Haute Foraine, by keeping the summit ot the Conchee in line with the lighthouse, W. by N. A N. Ie Pisnon, an isolated dangerous rock lying N.E. A N. rather more than half a mile from the summit of the Haute Foraine, uncovers 10 feet at the lowest tides, and does not show in ordinary neaps. At a cable's length to the south-east of this rock there is a flat, with only 2 feet water on it. A sand bank also, with 10 feet on it, lies 3 cables to the north-east of the Haute Foraine. Le Founet, the most eastern rock of the Chausey group, uncovers 7 feet at the lowest tides, and the marks for it are, the Canue and the Etat in one, or nearly so, N.W. N. ; Coutances cathedral its own breadth open to the eastward of Mont Martin mill, E.N.E. ; and the top of the Conchee perceptibly open to the southward of the little hillock which crowns the south point of the large Huguenan bearing West.* Basse du Founet, an isolated rocky patch, on which there are only 31 feet at the lowest tides, lies N.E. by N. If cables from the Founet, and between it and the Pignon there are patches of from 10 to 14 feet. The summit ofthe Conchee in one with the stone pillar on the large Huguenan leads to the southward of the Founet ; and the Etat kept twice its apparent breadth to the northward of the summit of the Canue leads to the north ward of the Basse du Founet. The Chausey pilots take vessels, even at low-water springs, between the Founet and the Pignon, but strangers can only use this passage at low-water neaps, or at 2 hours' flood at the springs, and should not attempt it when the Haute Foraine is covered. This inconvenience would, however, not exist if this rock were marked by a large beacon with a ball on its summit. It has a beacon on it, but so slight that it can only be seen a short distance off. La Canue. \u2014 This rock, called also Grande Canue, never wholly covers ; it lies E. by N. A N. 31 miles from Chausey lighthouse, and its summit is 6 feet above the level of the highest tides. Lztat, called also Petite Canue, is a remarkable rock lying on the northern edge of the Chausey group, and on its summit is a stone pillar, similar to the one erected en the largest Huguenan. These pillars, which when in one bear S.S.W. and N.N.E. from each other, are intended to show the western limit ofthe fishing grounds, and are likewise of great use as marks to lead between the Marie ledge and the Catheue reef. L'Enseigne, a small islet about 8 feet above the level of high-water \"reat springs, lies 2 miles to the northward of La Tour point, and is remarkable * A pole beacon was placed on this rock in January 1659."], [329, "313 CHAP. VI.] ILES CHAUSEY. by the uniform convexity of its surface,* as well as by a small stone beacon erected on its summit. Les Rondes de la Bechiree, a rocky ridge situated on the north-west side of the Chausey group, is 3 cables long in a N.E. and S.W. direction, and the northernmost head on it uncovers 39 feet, and the highest head, which is nearly iu the middle of the ridge, uncovers 45 feet at the lowest tides. There are several other low heads on the ridge ; the one which lies at its south extreme uncovers only 4 feet, and the marks for it are, the north west point ofthe Pointue touching the south-east extreme of the Deehiree, E. f N. ; and the lighthouse in line with the Chapeau, S. by E. A E. Basse du Chenal. \u2014 This small rocky patch, lying exactly in the fairway of the entrance to Les Rondes anchorage, about three-quarters of a cable to the northward of the north extreme of the Rondes de l'Ouest, has only 5 feet over it at the lowest tides. The marks for it are, the Pointue just open to the southward of the Deehiree, E. by N. ; and the lighthouse a little open to the south-west of Gros Mont, S.S.E. A E. Les Rondes de l'Ouest is a rocky ridge, 6 cables long N.N.E. and S.S.W., and 2 cables broad, forming the western extreme of the Chausey group. Several of the heads on the ridge never cover, and serve as marks for the south-west extreme of the group. SOTJWB de chausey, so called from the secure anchorage it affords to vessels of light draught, trends nearly N.N.W. and S.S.E. along the eastern side of the Grande-Ile, and occupies a space 6 cables long from abreast La Tour point, to the eastward of the stone beacon erected on the summit of Gros Mont. At low-water springs it is surrounded by rocks, and by banks of sand and mud, which form a natural harbour, where vessels constructed to take the ground will find capital shelter. If in tending, however, to remain longer than one tide, or at the springs, they must moor head and stern, to prevent tailing on the banks. The Sound is sheltered on all sides except from S.S.E. to E.S.E., and strong winds from that quarter throw in a heavy sea at high water. Fresh winds from N.N.E. to N.W. are also much felt, and cause a heavy swell throughout the whole extent of the Sound from one hour before till two hours after high water. Although the deepest parts of this Sound do not dry, there remains but little water in them, and the soundings are very irregular. There are, however, two narrow gullies in which three or four short vessels, drawing from 10 to 11 feet, may remain afloat at low water. The largest, at * View 99."], [330, "314 [chap. vi. CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO GRANVILLE. the entrance of the Sound, is 325 yards long, and from 55 to 65 yards broad, and the depth in it varies from 10 to 17 feet. The second, which is only 173 yards long, with a depth of from 10 to 15 feet, is a little more to the northward than the former, in front of the farm and the new church, and abreast of the Crabiere rock, which has a beacon on it, and uncovers 24 feet at the lowest tides. A good place for grounding is on the lowest part ofthe beach, between the Crabiere and the Tourette rocks, where the bottom is soft mud, and vessels drawing 13 or 14 feet do not strain. directions. \u2014 There are two entrances leading to Chausey Sound, one from the southward, between La Tour point and Longue isle, and the other from the north-west, between the Enseigne and the Etardiere. The former, which is the best on account of its simplicity, is divided into two channels (called South and South-East channels) by the Epiettes, but neither of them are practicable at low water. The South channel, between the point and the Epiettes, is accessible to vessels drawing 10 feet as soon as the Tonneau rock, which lies a cable's length to the south-east of the point and dries 12 feet at the lowest tides, is covered; there will also be 12 feet in mid-channel at 2 hours' flood. In taking this channel, bring the white stone pillar, erected on the Enseigne, in sight to the eastward of the slope on the eastern side of Grande-Ile (but only just in sight), N. W., which will lead between the Epiettes patch and the rocks extending from the point. The beacon on the rock which forms the south-west point of the Epiettes may then be approached to within half a cable ; then steer to the northward in mid-channel, parallel to the shore of the isle, and if intending to run to the northward of the Crabiere, pass to the east ward of it, giving it a berth of at least 30 or 40 yards, as a tail runs out from it in that direction. The leading mark for the South-East channel is the beacon on Gros Mont in line with the Tourette rock (which is the name given to a short steep point on the beach, a cable's length to the north-eastward of the farm), bearing N.W. When passing Longue isle, open the beacon its breadth to the westward of the Tourette, to clear the ledge extending offthe south end of that isle, taking care, however, after passing it to bring them quickly in one, which mark will lead between the Loup and the Ebauche* ridge (both of which have beacons on them, the first on its north-west point, to be left on the port hand, and the other on the south point of the ridge, to be left on the starboard hand), over a bank of mud and to the northward of the Epiettes, when either anchor or proceed as if coming through the South channel. This mud bank, which completely bars the channel, dries at low-water springs, and cannot be crossed by vessels above 10 feet"], [331, "315 CHAI'. VI.] ILES CHAUSEY. draught till at least 2A hours' flood ; when the highest head of the Loup covers there are 16 feet water on the bank. The Worth-west Entrance into Sound de Chausey is to the northward of the Enseigne, between the rocks extending 2 cables to the eastward of the Pointue rock and the Grande Entree ; this latter is a small group of rocks, the highest head of which uncovers 38 feet, lying 3^ cables to the east ward of the low heads extending to the eastward of the Pointue. The highest head of the Pointue uncovers 41^ feet. The greater part of the rocks bounding this channel into the Sound are marked with beacons which, with strict attention to the following directions, will render it, to persons locally acquainted with the Chausey group, easy of access between the periods of half-flood and half-ebb for a vessel drawing not more than 10 feet ; no stranger should, however, attempt so intricate and contracted a navigation. The channel from the above entrance continues in a southerly direction between the beacon on the western edge a rocky group named the Longues, and the beacon on a flat rock, which uncovers 8 feet and lies a cable's length to the eastward of the Etardiere and is joined to that rock at low water springs by a sand-bank ; these beacons are only 2 cables apart. From thence the channel takes a W.S.W. direction between the Etardiere, which never covers, and the Enseigne; and then a southerly direction, passing to the westward of the low rocks extending to the south-west of the Petite Enseigne, the Sauniere, a small islet 57 feet above the lowest tides, and the Petite Fourche, and to the eastward of the Massue, and a rocky group situated to the eastward of the Vieux ; and from thence to the Sound. A rock, with a beacon on it, lies off the north end of the Petite Fourche, exactly in the fairway, and a vessel can pass either between it and the Petite Fourche, or to the south-west, between it and the group lying to the eastward of the Vieux. In entering the North-West channel into Chausey Sound keep the light house touching the north-east slope of the Enseigne bearing South a little easterly, passing to the eastward of the low rocks extending to the eastward of the Pointue. When to the southward of the Pointue, bring the light house in line with the south-west slope ofthe Enseigne, to run between the Longues and the above 8 feet flat rock. When the two white patches on the Massue and the Chapeau rocks are in one, or the south end of Meule islet is just touching the north end of the Massue, S.W. A W., run in that direction until the lighthouse is in line with the south-west point of the Sauniere islet, S. by E., which will lead to the westward of the latter rock, and after passing it steer in mid-channel between the beacons."], [332, "[CHAP. Tl. 316 CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO GRANVILLE. L'Enseigne Anchorage is a small contracted space where cutters or sma steamers, drawing not more than 10 feet water, and under the guidance o good pilots, may find shelter from S.W., southerly, or S.E. winds. With northerly winds no vessel should anchor there, except to await water through the North-West channel into Chausey Sound, as from its limited extent there is no room to veer, or drive, without tailing on the sand-bank, which at low water dries H cables to the northward of the Enseigne. When running for this anchorage through the north-west entrance to Chausey Sound, keep the lighthouse touching the north-east slope of the Enseigne bearing South a little easterly, until the vessel is to the south ward ofthe Pointue; then bring the lighthouse in line with the south-west slope, and when the south end of Meule islet touches the north end of the Massue rock, anchor, and the vessel will be in the middle of the anchorage, and in the deepest water, 22 to 36 feet, sandy bottom, midway between the flat rock lying to the eastward of the Etardiere and the Longues. Great care must be taken between the periods of half-ebb and half-flood, to calculate the height of the tide, as the soundings, when to the southward of the Pointue, vary from 7 to 22 feet at low water, and also to avoid a small rock with only 4 feet on it lying nearly in the fairway of the entrance. port -MARIE is a little hay, formed between La Tour and Bretagne points, in front of which, at 2 cables off shore, there is a small space capable of affording shelter from all winds N. W., round northerly, to N.E., to two or three vessels of not more than 10 feet draught. directions. \u2014 The anchorage off Port Marie, which is not more than 3 cables in extent, lies between the Bretagne rocks and the Tour patches, and to enter it from the south-west bring the beacon on the Etat rock in line with La Tour point, N.E. by E. A E. ; or the northernmost and highest head of the Epiettes quite shut in, leads to the south-east of the Bretagne rocks and to the north-west of the Tour patches, over the Chateau patch, and when the beacon on the Huguenan is in one with the Grand Cheval, E. by S., anchor in a depth varying from 15 to 22 feet at low water over a sandy bottom. To enter from the south-east, bring the westermost point of Grande-Ile, forming Port Homard, to touch Bretagne point N.N.W., and it will lead to the south-west of the Tour patches, and to the north-east of the Chateau patch and Bretagne rocks, and when the northernmost head of the Epiettes is shut in with La Tour point, anchor. PORT KAISIE ROAD, LA COKCHEE, and L'ETAT ANCHORAGES. \u2014 Port marie Road is an excellent anchorage for large vessels of war, and"], [333, "317 ILES CHAUSEY. CHP.VI.] is in reality the principal roadstead of Granville ; for the greater part of the shipping bound there remain at anchor in it until the water on the banks is sufficiently high for them to proceed. The best position for a vessel of large draught to anchor in this road is, with the lighthouse bearing N. by W. A \\V. and distant from the shore a mile, or half a mile, in 7 or 8 fathoms or more according to the direction of the wind and the vessel's draught. When at anchor, Coutances cathedral should appear in sight to the northward ofthe largest Huguenans, E. by N. AN., and the Enseigne should be seen to the east ward of La Tour point. She will here be sheltered from the wind, if to the northward of N.W. by N., by the rocks forming the south-west part ofthe Chausey group ; and should it be inclined to draw more westerly, with an appearance of bad weather, the first opportunity must be taken of weighing and getting to windward with the ebb, or run either into Cancale road, where good shelter will be found under the Herpin rock, or to the eastward and northward of the Chausey group, as the wind may make it necessary. La Conchee Anchorage. \u2014 With the wind from N.W. by W. to N.N.E. the Conchee auchorage is to be preferred ; the mark for which is, the old castle in ruins on Grande-IIe in one with the beacon on the Huguenan, N.W. by W. |W., and the Selliere and Culassiere rocks in one N.N.W.A W., in 5 fathoms at low water. L Etat Anchorage. \u2014 With the wind to the southward of West, the anchorage under the Etat rock should be resorted to; anchor with the lighthouse in line with the Canue, or with the beacon on the Etat, according to the direction of the wind, at half or three-quarters of a mile from the rocks, in from 5 to 7 fathoms. Indeed, all the northern shore of the Chausey group affords shelter against southerly and south-westerly winds, and is bold and may be approached without fear. Les RODTDES de i'otjest astchosage, situated on the west side of the Chausey group, under the Rondes de l'Ouest ridge, is the only shelter the group affords to large vessels during easterly winds. It can be reached at 'any time of tide, either from Port Marie road, or from the Conchee or the Etat anchorages. When proceeding towards it from Port Marie road, keep the beacon on the Huguenan in one with the highest rock of the Piliers, E. \\ S., to pass to the southward of the Chateau patch, and when Gros Mont bears N.E. i N. haul gradually in, but not farther than to have the middle of Longue isle in one with La Tour point, E.

When the Ronde de l'Ouest, a large remarkable round rock,* is in sight to the westward of the Corbiere, N. by W., haul in to within a quarter ofa mile ofthe rocks, passing between the Corbiere bank and the Chausey group. When the lighthouse is midway between Gros Mont and the west extreme of Grande-Ile, or touching the south end of Meule islet, S.E., and the Etat beacon is about midway between the Enseigne and the Grande Entree, E. f S., anchor in from 7 to 9 fathoms over sandy bottom, at half a mile to the westward of the Rondes de l'Ouest and the same distance to the north- east of the Corbiere bank. beauchamp anchorage lies about a quarter of a mile to the north-west of the Huguenans, and in case of need might be used as a shelter, at the springs, for one or two vessels of large draught when under the guidance of good pilots. It consists of a kind of basin or deep, about 3 cables long, north and south, 2 cables wide, with a depth of from 29 to 40 feet in it at low-water springs, over excellent holding ground, extending from the line on which the lighthouse is in one with the south extreme of the Ango rock, to that on which the beacon on Gros Mont is in line with the northern hillock on the islet called Grande Ancre or Saddle island. It is sheltered at low-water springs by the rocks and the surrounding sand and mud banks, and it is also pretty well protected at the neaps; but at high water during the springs, fresh winds from N.W., round northerly, to N.E., cause a heavy tumbling sea, which, however, soon sub sides as the tide falls. The usual moorings are laid down N.N.E. and S.S.W., but if intending to remain, the vessel should be secured with anchors on each bow and quarter. The French steam-vessels employed in the oyster fishery have moorings laid down for their use. Vessels of small tonnage, light draught, a fair wind, and under the care of experienced pilots, may enter the Beauchamp anchorage from the southward at all times of tide, by passing between the Grande Piliers rock and the Tournioure rock, or between the latter rock and the Chapelle rock ; but these narrow passages could not be used without sufficient wind to stem the streams. Passe Orientale de L'Etat. \u2014 The Beauchamp anchorage can also be reached by running through this passage, which is a clear space formed among the rocks on the north-east part of the Chausey group ; the tide must, however, be sufficiently high for a vessel to cross the sand-bank, which extends over the greater part of the passage, and dries from 2 to 5 feet above the level of the lowest tides. * View 119."], [335, "319 CHAP. VI.] ILES CHAUSEY. The entrance to this passage, lA cables wide, lies between the Pouillou rock, which uncovers 32 feet, and some small rocky heads which are connected to the Petit Etat, and uncover from 5 to 10 feet. From thence the passage is bounded on the west side by the Caniard du Sud, which uncovers 38 feet and by the Mauvaise, which is always above water ; and on the east side by a small rocky group named Plate du Hibou, the highest head of whicli uncovers 26\u00a3 feet, and by the Culassiere rock which is never covered. The leading mark through is, Petite Ancre islet in one with the Mauvaise, S.W. by W., until within about H cables of the latter, then steer to the southward, to pass between it and the Culassiere, and from thence to the anchorage. Passe de la Conchee lies between the Huguenans and the Conchee rocks, and from thence to the north-west, between two mud-banks, which dry from 3 to 7 feet above the lowest tides. The entrance is between the Gaillard d' Avant rock, which uncovers 30 feet, and some small heads which lie close to the south-west of the Conchee and uncover 17A feet. The leading mark through is, the Selliere and the Petite Mauvaise rocks in one, N. by W. \u00a7\u2022 W., until the lighthouse comes in one with the middle of the Ango rock; then haul to the westward and cross the mud-bank, which extends to the northward from the Huguenans, to the anchorage. When the small heads lying close to the south-west ofthe Conchee cover, or the Artimon rock, which lies a little to the north-east of the Gaillard d' Avant and uncovers 19 feet, there will not be less than 10 or 11 feet on any part of the mud-bank, which must be crossed by a vessel running for the anchorage. ANCHORAGE between Les RONDES de l'OUEST and La DECHIKEE. \u2014 This anchorage, which is similar to that of the Enseigne, is situated on the north-west side of the Chausey group, and affords partial shelter from South, round easterly, to N.E. It is about 3 cables long and 2 cables wide, and has a depth varying from 22 to 40 feet, sandy bottom. The entrance is lA cables wide, E. by N.

To enter this anchorage, proceed as before, with the lighthouse in line with the beacon, S.S.E. \u00a7 E., and when the Pointue is half its apparent breadth open to the southward ofthe Deehiree, E. by N., the vessel will be to the southward of the south-west extreme of the Rondes de la Deehiree, and should haul to the eastward, taking care to steer sufficiently to the north ward to avoid two rocky patches which lie on the south side ofthe anchorage, and are awash at low-water springs. When the lighthouse is in one with the Massue rock, S. byE. | E., anchor in from 4 to 5 fathoms water, over rather coarse ground.

The stream turns at the east end of the group, between the Founet and Pignon rocks, from 25 to 30 minutes earlier than in the middle of the passage between the Founet and the Roc de Granville, that is to say, the flood begins to be felt about 4-A hours before the time of high water at Granville, and the ebb one hour after. St. GERmAlN bay is formed by the land bending in to the eastward between Cape Carteret and the Senequet rock, and affords shelter from all winds between N.N.E., round easterly, and S.E. in 5 fathoms over good holding ground, composed of sandy clay; but a vessel must on no account, after passing the Feles banks, approach the land nearer than SA miles, to avoid several patches with only from 4 to 8 feet water on them. The best anchorage will be found with Cape Carteret light house bearing N. f E., and Pirou tower from S.E. to S.E. by E.

LES NATTES. 321 The Senequet is the highest head of a rocky ridge which extends from it to the eastward and joins the shore, extends to the south-east as far as the Klebet rocks, to the S.S.W. as far as the Nattes rocks, and to the north-west for the distance of 8 cables' lengths. This last part of the ridge is very dangerous, as it projects so far to the westward, and greatly contracts the passage between it and the B\u0153uf. The outermost head on it is awash at the lowest tides, and lies with the tower on the Senequet just open to the southward of Blainville church steeple, S.E. A S. The space for 2 miles, between this head and the Nattes, is equally dangerous, being one continued chain of rocks, the highest of which uncover from 6 to 8 feet, and when it blows hard between North, round westerly, and South there is a heavy sea on them. By keeping Mont Gardon church steeple between the summit of Mont Doville and St. Germain church steeple, a vessel will pass a safe distance to the westward of the Nattes and the rocky heads on the west side of the Senequet. Les nattes form a small rocky group, about 2 cables long N.W. and 3.E., at the south-west extreme of the ridge extending from the Senequet, and are the most western rocks which uncover in the vicinity of the shore between the harbours of St. Germain and Regneville. They lie W. by N. 3i miles from the entrance of Blainville harbour, S.W. f W. 2\\ miles from the Senequet, and the marks for the highest head, which uncovers IA feet at the lowest tides, are, the tower on the Senequet a little open to the eastward of Pirou church steeple, N.E. f E., and Coutances steeples in line with the houses of Courtainville village (built on a remarkable mound), S.E. b. E. 2 E- A vessel will pass to the westward of the west extreme of this group, when bound to the southward, by keeping Pirou steeple well open to the westward of the tower on the Senequet. This extreme bears S. f W. 19i miles from Cape Carteret lighthouse, but it is only in very clear weather that the light can be seen so far to the southward. There are several small ridges of rock, uncovering from 3 to 5 feet at low-water springs and forming a chain a mile in length, which extends from the Nattes to the north-east as far as the beach, and rejoins the outer sunken rocks of the Senequet ridge. A heavy sea runs on all these rocks when it blows hard from the westward. Havre de blainville is situated about 3f miles to the S.W. by S. of Geffosse harbour (page 296), nearly midway between that harbour and Regneville. It is a kind of lagoon almost entirely filled with sand, and can only afford shelter to fishing boats at the springs. [e. c\u2014 2. J y"], [338, "322 CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO GRANVILLE. [chap. VI.

There are no available marks on the shore for the western head of the Agon rocks, which are extremely dangerous to approach between half ebb and half flood, and a heavy sea runs on them when it blows hard from the westward ; but by keeping Hatainville sand hills shut in with Cape Carteret, N. f E., or the bluff point,* 6 miles to the southward of Granville, named Bee de Champeaux or Champeaux point, in sight to the westward of Pointe du Roc, S.

HAVRE DE REGNEVILLE. 323 Havre de regneville is situated near the mouth of two little rivers, named the Sienne and the Soulles, the waters of which unite 4 miles in the interior, but being so entirely filled with sand, it will only admit coasters of about 8 or 9 feet draughtat high-water springs. The bottom ofthe harbour being chiefly composed of sand and shells is bad for holding ; the anchors should therefore be buried to avoid driving with strong winds between W.N.W. and S.W., to which the entrance is exposed. The entrance lies between the Bee d'Agon or Agon point, and the point on which the guard-house stands (whicli with Mont Martin windmill is the mark for the south-west extreme of the Ronquet group), and several sand banks lie in the fairway. Two channels lead to the entrance. The prin cipal channel runs along the south side of the Ronquet group ancl the Moulieres d'Agon, and the leading mark for it is the fort (standing 3 cables to the north-west of the extremity of Agon point) seen between the steeples of Coutances and that of Grimouville, E. A N. The other channel, named the Cohere, is not quite so deep as the former, but it has the advantage of leading directly into the harbour, and avoiding the turn to the south-east of Agon point. The Caillou rock, which uncovers 17 feet, lies on the east side of this channel, and the leading mark in is, Grimouville church steeple a little open to the right ofthe custom-house (the last large house on the shore on the north part of Regneville village), E.N.E.

These banks are in some measure connected with the shore(as far south as the Roc de Granville, and to the north as faras the Ronquet lees) by a bed of sand, which has only from 2 to 12 feet over it at low water, at which time there is no navigable passage between the banks and the shore. La catheue is a dangerous reef, about a mile long in a W.S.W. and E.N.E. direction, and a quarter of a mile broad, lying close to the north end of the Catheue banks.

S. and E. A n., IA cables wide, and united to the land by a narrow isthmus at half a mile tothe northward of Gautier point. The upper town is sur rounded by walls, and occupies the eastern part of the peninsula ; the lower town stands on the isthmus at the entrance of a narrow valley enclosed between high hills, and watered by the little river Bose, which separates the suburbs from the lower town, and its waters in the rainy season run over the sand to the westward. The outer harbour is on the west side of the lower town at the foot of Le Roc, which, with the adjacent land, shelters it from N.W., round northerly, to S.S.E., and the pier protects it from the heavy sea caused by south-westerly winds, but it is open from South to S.S.E. The water is smooth in the harbour when it blows hard from North to N.W., but vessels at that time should be well moored, for violent squalls rush down from Le Roc. The pier is built on the rocks which uncover at the foot of the south-west part of Le Roc. It begins at 65 yards to the westward of the last houses in the lower town, and from thence extends South 399 yards ; it then turns S.E. by E. A E. 219 yards, and is terminated by a broad pier head. A floating basin has been constructed at the eastern part of the harbour, and its sill is 8j feet, and its bottom 13\u00a3 feet above the level of the lowest tides. The outer harbour dries out at low water, but is accessible, at both springs and neaps, to vessels of large draught. The inner harbour can only be entered at springs from 1 hour to IA hours before or after high water, according to the range of the tide. The outer harbour can be entered at ordinary neaps from lA hours before to 1^ hours after high water ; the bottom is composed of mud, and a sharp vessel will ground upright and lie in safety. A beach of muddy sand and gravel extends 8 or 9 cables off shore between Pointe du Roc and Champeaux point, and several rocky ridges rise above it, and uncover at low-water springs. These rocks begin about 2 miles to the northward of Champeaux point, and extend almost uninter ruptedly along the outer part of the beach as far as Gautier point. This latter point, bearing S.E. by E. A E. 9 cables from the south-west extreme of Le Roc, is high, and on its summit is a fort which commands the entrance of the harbour. The rocky bed forming the base of the western"], [344, "[chap. vi. 328 CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO GRANVILLE. part of Le Roc also uncovers at low water as far out as 2 cables to the North and N.W. from the north-west part of the peninsula, and 3h cables to the S. by W. from Pointe du Roc. Le Loup, the nearest danger to the harbour, lies S. by W. f W. 2| cables from the extremity of the pier, and uncovers 21 feet at the lowest tides. This rock forms a kind of natural breakwater, sheltering the harbour fromthe heavy sea during S.W. gales. The pier-head lighthouse in line with the gap which separates Le Roc from the hills to the north east of it bearing N.E. A E. leads a cable to the westward of the Loup ; and the same lighthouse in line with Granville church steeple N. by E. A E. leads half a cable to the eastward. The rock is marked by a beacon, and covers at half flood, at which period there are 10 feet between the pier-heads, 6 feet within them, and I65 feet over the Tombelaine bank. lights. \u2014 Granville lighthouse, 43 feet high, stands on the west end of Le Roc peninsula, and exhibits, at 154 feet above high water, a fixed while light, dioptric and ofthe third order, visible in clear weather at 15 miles. A fixedred light, catoptric ancl of the fifth order, is shown from a light house on the south-east extremity ofthe pier-head, on the west side of the entrance to the outer harbour. It is elevated 26 feet above high water, and visible at 3 miles. DIRECTIONS from CAFE de la HAGUE to GRANVILLE through cotentin passage. \u2014 This passage runs along the western coast ofthe peninsula of Cotentin, and is situated in a great measure on the sandy flat which occupies nearly the whole extent of the shore between Cape Carteret and Granville. Coasters may use it at all times of tide, but sailing vessels of large draught, when bound to Granville, seldom attempt it, as it can only be done with a leading wind sufficiently strong to stem the flood stream with which they have to contend at the time the harbour is accessible, and they must also wait for water over the flat which bars the passage between the Feles banks and the coast ; they generally take La Deroute channel, passing to the westward of Jersey. The streams in the Cotentin passage run nearly parallel to the shore, and their strength, at springs, is from 4 to 5 knots, and 2i? or 3 knots at neaps. Winds between South and East are the most favourable for entering from the southward, and between North and East from the northward. In fine weather a vessel bound to the northward may run through it with the wind from South to S.W., and from North to N.W. if bound to the southward ; but it would be imprudent to enter it with the wind blowing strong between S.W., round westerly, and N.W., or in thick weather."], [345, "329 CHAP. VI.] PORT DE GRANVILLE ; DIRECTIONS. Li running through this passage from the northward, it must be borne in mind that the south-west stream begins to be felt in the Race of Alderney at the time when it is half ebb on the coast at Cape de la Hague, or at about 4 hours after high water at Granville or St. Malo, and that it would be quite impossible, even if the Race is crossed during the last of the north-east stream, to reach Granville before low water in the passage, at which time there is not sufficient depth, for a vessel of large draught, over the flat between the Feles banks and the shore, and she must of neces sity anchor to wait for water, which will not take place until at least one quarter flood, when there will be about 24 feet in the fairway with the leading mark on at springs, and 7 feet over the shoalest part of the Feles. Anchorage will be found in Vauville or in Sciotot bay, or under Cape Carteret. The best position at the latter place is in 4 fathoms, with the lighthouse just open to the westward of the fort on the western pitch of the Cape, and distant about 2 miles. When through the Race, and having given the Nez-de-Jobourg a berth of at least 3 miles, to avoid the Huquets de Jobourg, steer for Cape Flaman ville, and from thence, as the vessel advances to the southward, keep the perpendicular point of the Nez well open to the westward of Cape Flaman ville, so as to have the lighthouse at Cape de la Hague open also of the Nez, by which precaution she will pass to the westward of Bihard flat, the outer patch of the Surtainville banks, and to the westward of the Rit rocks. When abreast the latter (which will be known when Port Bail and Gouey churches come in sight to the southward of Cape Carteret) haul in gradually towards the land to avoid the Trois-Grunes (page 285), and to shut in the north-west peak of the lofty light-coloured sand hills of Hatainville (page 292) with the dark bluff and nearly perpendicular point of Cape Carteret,* N. f E., which is the fairway mark between the Feles banks and the coast, and will lead over the tail of these banks in 15 feet at the lowest tides. If there be water enough for the vessel to proceed to the southward, keep the latter mark on, and it will lead between the Jourdan ridge and the foul ground offthe Senequet rock; but the sand hills must again be opened out when passing this foul ground. Cape Flamanville just in sight to the westward of Cape Carteret will lead over the south-east tail of the Feles banks ; but it must for the same reason be gradually opened out as the vessel proceeds to the southward. Rosel point in sight to the westward of Cape Carteret leads nearly midway between the Jourdan ridge and the foul * View 85."], [346, "330 [chap. vi. CAPE DE LA HAGUE TO GRANVILLE. ground off the Senequet ; but Rosel point is not always well defined, being confused with the land behind it. When in the vicinity of the Senequet rock, steer so as to get the bluff point 6 miles to the southward of Granville, named Champeaux point*, just in sight to the westward of Pointe du Roc, the west extreme of the peninsula on which the town of Granville stands, bearing S. A W., which (if the state of the tide and the vessel's draught will admit) will lead up to Pointe du Roc, inshore of the Catheue reef; but if there is not water over the banks, look out, as the vessel advances to the southward, for the remarkable trees on Mont Huchon, about 2 miles to the northward of Coutances, and do not bring them in one with Agon church until the Etat (Chausey) appears in one with the Huguenans about S.S.W. The latter will be the leading mark to the westward of the Catheue reef until Coutance cathedral comes in line with Bee d'Agon or Agon point, when steer towards Granville, minding to keep the Etat well open to the northward of the Canue, after passing them, until Mont St. Michel appears within twice its breadth of Champeaux points bearing South, or until Coutances cathedral comes in one with Mont Martin church, N.E. b. E. A E., either of which will lead to the eastward of the Admiralty bank. When Chausey lighthouse opens to the southward of the Huguenans, W.N.W., haul up for it, to avoid the Haguet bank, or anchor, if there is not suffi cient water to enter Granville. At the early period of 2 hours' flood there will be 11 feet over the Catheue, the Founet, and the Cartheue banks. The French pilots generally proceed through the Cotentin passage as follows : \u2014 If by day, run through Alderney race if possible during the last of the north-east stream, then, if the vessel's draught is not too great to pass without risk between the Feles banks and the land at low water, steer to the southward to bring Jobourg church steeple in line with the extreme of Cape Flamanville, N. by E. A E., and by keeping this mark very carefully on it will lead to the eastward of the Bihard flat, and the Caillou rock, and over the Surtainville banks, in 3 fathoms at low water. When the steeples of Port Bail and Gouey open of Cape Carteret, steer S.S.E., so as to be about 2j miles from that Cape when it is in one with Cape Flamanville, bearing N. A E. From thence, by keeping the latter Cape open and shut of Cape Carteret, it will lead between the Feles banks and the main as far as the Senequet, but when abreast St. Germain a vessel may sheer in a little towards the coast ancl anchor to the north-west of the Sac-de-Pirou rocks, to avoid the strength of the northern stream ; or if the wind is strong * Views 92, 126. f View 93."], [347, "CHAP.

As soon as Coutances cathedral is in line with Blainville church, steer S.W. to run between the Marie ledge and the north extreme of the Catheue reef, continuing on this course until Agon tower is in one with Mont Huchon bearing East, at which time the vessel will be sufficiently advanced for the beacons on the Huguenans and the Etat (Chausey) to be made out, and by keeping them in one, it will lead up in the fairway.

In working towards the harbour from the S.W., make a long board to the northward of the line on which St. Nicolas church steeple is in one with the slope of the south part of Gautier point, E. f S., to avoid being carried too far to the northward by the flood stream. The last board should be made to the south-east of the Loup, but not nearer than half a mile, to avoid a ridge of rocks named the Norocher, parts of which uncover from 10 to 12 feet at the lowest tides. From thence stand tothe eastward of the Loup, on which side it can be approached to half a cable without danger. Should the beacon on this rock be washed away, Granville church steeple in line with the lighthouse on the mole head, N. by E. A e., leads clear to the eastward. Small coasters arriving offthe harbour with the wind offshore at low water during the neaps, can anchor until there is sufficient water to enter, between the Loup and the Tombelaine bank, over a bottom of sand and broken shells. There are a few rocks on the eastern part of this anchorage, but by keeping Mont St. Michel open and shut of Champeaux point, it will be 2 cables to the westward of them. leaving granville, a sailing vessel of large draught should wait for a leading wind, and, if bound to the westward, advantage should be taken of off-shore winds, particularly those between East and South.

By keeping the Tombelaine open and shut with Pointe du Roc bearing about South, the vessel will pass to the eastward of the Catheue, and this mark is to be preferred when the tide is sufficiently high to allow of its being followed, for from its height it is seen a greater distance and can be followed much longer than the other. At low-water springs the only mark that can be used with safety is, the beacon on the Huguenans in one with the beacon on the Etat, S.S.W., which leads to the westward of Shamrock knowl, midway between the Catheue and the Marie, and when Coutances cathedral is in line with Agon tower, haul up and steer N.E. i E. to pass between the Jourdan ridge and the foul ground off the Senequet. Having run on either of the former marks, when abreast the Nottes rocks, or when Coutances cathedral is midway between Blainville and Agon churches, or rather closer to Blainville, bearing S.E. by E. -| E., steer N.E. f N. or N.E.

When abreast St. Germain, steer North, or a little more to the westward to bring Capes Carteret and Flamanville in one, before reaching the parallel of the entrance to Surville.

But at the neaps, this passage can rarely be traversed through its whole extent by a sailing vessel in one tide, unless with a strong leading wind. The anchorage abreast St. Germain must therefore be resorted to during the southern stream, and as soon as it slacks proceed under all sail, so as to reach the Race of Alderney before the north-east stream has acquired its full strength, as it will be of great assistance if bound to the eastward. At Night steer for Granville light on a S. by E., A E. bearing, and it will lead midway between the Admiralty and the Catheue banks, also between the Founet and the Catheue reef. When Chausey light bears S.W. A S., by keeping it so and steering N.E.

GRANVILLE TO CAPE FREHEL. Vaeiatiox 22\u00b0 West in 1859. The lighthouse on Cape Frehel bears W. \\ N. 29A miles from that of Granville, and the coast between forms a deep bight to the south-east, named Baie du Mont St. Michel, in which is situated the roadstead of Cancale, affording excellent shelter from the westward for vessels of any size. The harbours of St. Malo and St. Servan lie to the westward of this bay, and, like Granville, can be entered at the springs by vessels of the largest draught.* The most remarkable objects on this part of the coast are the Bee de Champeaux or Champeaux point, Mont St. Michel, and the Tombelaine rock. The former is a bold high bluff formed at the western extreme of green hills, which suddenly break off to seaward at 5f miles to the S. -| W. of Granville lighthouse. Mont St. Michel and the Tomberlaine are two conspicuous objects rising from the sands in the eastern part of Mont St. Michel bay. The former is a remarkable pyramidal block of granite, 4 cables in diameter, which at high water is completely surrounded, but from which at low tide the sea recedes to a great distance, leaving it dry for several miles. Its summit is surmounted by large buildings and an ancient abbey church, the steeples of which are 420 feet above the level of the beach. It bears S. \u00a3 W. nearly 7 miles from Champeaux point, and its exterior resembles Mount St. Michael in Cornwall. The Tombelaine is a barren islet almost as large as Mont St. Michel, but much lower. It lies nearly 1 A miles to the northward of the Mont, and when seen from the northward or southward, has the appearance of a crushed pyramid inclining to the eastward. Between Granville and Champeaux point the coast curves slightly in to the eastward, and is generally of middling height ; but in some places it is low and sandy, and dangerous to approach with westerly winds, being bordered by a sand-bank with flat rocks on it, which in some places extend a mile from the shore. bais de mont st. iwichel is formed between Champeaux and Grouin points, which bear W. by N. and E. by S. from each other distant 11 miles, and is in a great measure exposed to all the violence of N.W. and * See Admiralty Chart, North Coast of France, Sheet ix., Treguier to St. Germain, No. 2,668 ; scale m = half an inch."], [353, "CHAP. VII.] BAIE DU MONT ST. MICHEL. 337 northerly winds ; the anchorages, however, off Cancale and La Houle, in the north-west part of the bay, afford excellent shelter against westerly winds. The head of the bay falls back a great distance to the south-east, and nearly three-fourths of it is occupied by an immense bank of sand, which dries at low water. On the west side of the bay the land is high for the space of 4 miles from Grouin to Chateau Richeux point, and the coast is generally steep. Cancale and La Houle are situated on this part of the coast, the former on the heights and the latter on the shore. A high pyramidal rock, named the Chatellier,* and the little fortified island of Rimains, lie off Chaine point, the first 2 and the other 4 cables' lengths from the point, and it is to the northward of this island, and about three quarters of a mile from the coast, that is situated the Grande Rade de Cancale. The low lands, called the marsh of Dol, begin at Chateau Richeux point and extend lo miles eastward, to the mouth of the river Couesnon, the course of which separates the department of Ile-et- Vilaine from that of La Manche. A strong dyke protects this marsh from the invasion of the sea, as its surface in several places is below the level of high-water great springs. The only remarkable rise on this part of the coast is a small isolated hill named Mont Dol, and a chain of hills, which seen from a north-west direction seem to form a long promontory, the north-west extreme of which is called by the local mariners Pointe de Gogre. Mont Dol rises from the midst of the marsh land at 6 miles to the south-east of Chateau Richeux point, and on its flat top stands a windmill, a telegraph, and a few cottages. Pointe de Gogre is the nearest point to the sea of the chain of hills which are situated about three-quarters of a mile from the beach between Mont Dol and the river Couesnon. Small vessels can go up the Couesnon at the springs as far as the town of Pontorson, but as the navigation is difficult it is seldom attempted. The little harbour of Vivier is situated on the shore of the bay, S. A E. about 7 miles from Grouin point, but it can only be entered by the smallest coasters having good pilots. It is formed at the bottom of a cove hollowed out of the mud by the waters of the Guyoul, having a floodgate which prevents the sea from entering the river, ancl will contain three or four cutters. Asmall quay has recently been built for the purpose of unloading. bang breton lies in the middle of Mont St. Michel bay, and on its shoalest part there is a depth of only 6 feet. By keeping Cancale church open to the northward of the fort on Rimains island, a vessel will pass to the northward of the bank in not less than 5 fathoms at low water. * View 96.

It is joined to the coast at Chaine point by a bed of sand, on which there are and 12 feet; and from thence it trends to the northward as lar as a small creek named Port Mer, leaving between it and the shallows near the shore a swatchway 3 cables broad, called by the local mariners fosse de Chatry or Chatry deep, in which the depths vary from 26 to 32 feet. From the northern part of this bank, Haut Bout windmill is in line with the northern declivity of Chatry point ; and from its eastern edge, the Cormorandiere is in one with the Hubert. These are two remarkable rocks joining Rimains island; the first is high and pointed, and lies at the north extreme of the island; the Hubert is in shape like a gunner's quoin, and lies about three-quarters of a cable to the eastward of the fort. banc des coxbiebes, bounding Cancale road to the eastward, is about 1-Aj miles long, from the line on which Haut Bout windmill is in one with the northern declivity of Chatry point, to the line on whicli the same windmill is in one with the Cormorandiere rock, and about half a mile broad. It is joined to the sandy beach at the head of Mont St. Michel bay by flats, on which the soundings gradually decrease from 20 to 8 feet at the lowest tides. The general depths on this bank vary from 2 to 4 fathoms, hut a small patch about 3 cables long, north and south, and with only 10 feet in it, rises from its southern part, about half a mile to the eastward of the fort on Rimains island. From the north end of this patch, the guard-house on Chaine point is in one with Cancale church steeple ; and from the south extreme the same steeple is between the Chatellier rock and Petit Rimains islet, which joins its northern end at low water. Les banchets This bank of sand and broken shells lies in the middle of the entrance to Cancale road, at 3 cables' lengths to the north- ward ofthe Corbieres bank, and S.E. by E.A E. three-quarters of a mile from the old fort on Landes island, and with a small knoll of 23A feet at 2 cables to the N.N.W. of it, is dangerous to vessels of large draught at low-water springs. The bank is 5| cables long N.W. and S.E., and the soundings on it vary- from 10 to 24 feet. The shoalest parts form tw.. small ridges lying parallel to each other, and athwart the direction of the streams. On the north-west ridge there are 1 7 feet at the lowest tides, and only 10 feet on the highest part of the other, which rises from the eastern part of the bank. The marks for the 10 feet are, the steep point of Chateau Richeux open 1\u00b0 to the eastward of Chaine point ; and the slope Grouin point open the same distance to the northward of the guard-"], [355, "339 CHAP. VII.] BAIE DU MONT ST. MICHEL. house on Landes island. The local mariners say that the sand forming this bank does not shift, but there is reason to think that the depths over it often change during strong gales. The mark for the small knoll of 23\u00a3 feet water is, Haut Bout mill in line with the northern point of the little bay of Port Mer. The mill kept just open to the southward of the point leads between this knoll and the Banchets ; and in one with the summit of the same point leads to the northward of the knoll. There are two other knolls, with 24 and 25 feet over them, lying a cable's length to the northward of the Banchets. La brehavt is an extensive flat of sand and rocks, lying to the south-east of the Banchets, and half a mile to the eastward of the northern part of the Corbieres bank. The soundings on it vary from 7 to 10 fathoms, and as the ground is very foul it should be avoided. Landes island, with the Herpin, Pierre de Herpin and Fille rocks, and a few shoal patches, form a kind of barrier extending 2 miles to the north-east of Grouin point, and across which vessels should pass when seeking shelter in Cancale road, or in the anchorage off La Houle. ile des landes. \u2014 This high, narrow, rocky islet, steep on all sides, and inaccessible when there is any swell on, lies 2 cables to the eastward of Grouin point, and at high water it is about 4 cables long, N.N.E. and S.S.W., and about a cable wide, but at low tide it is lengthened out 3 cables to the N.N.E. by some high rocks, and by some which cover. It trends in a direction nearly parallel to the shore, being separated from it by a channel called the Vieille Riviere, which is only 164 yards broad at its narrowest part, and through which at the springs the streams run 6 knots. The ruins of a fort and guard-house stand on the north-east part of the island. The Pignonet rock, with only 10A feet on it, lies in the middle of the passage between the north-east extreme of Landes island and the Herpin rock. Le herpin is a high pyramidal rock elevated about 66 feet above the highest tides, and its base is a cable in diameter at low water. It lies E.N.E. three-quarters of a mile from Grouin point, and nearly 2 cables from the north-east extreme of Landes island, and its shape, great height, and isolated position, render it a remarkable object from a great distance. Vessels bound to Granville, run for shelter under this rock with the wind off shore, and generally when it blows from West, round southerly, to East. There is good anchorage in from 7 to 9 fathoms water with the rock bearing N.W. W. distant from 1 to 1^ miles ; the ground however, so far out, is rather coarse. 7. 2"], [356, "340 [CHAP. VII.

It begins to show itself at about one-third ebb at the springs, and does not cover during the neaps. The space called the Grand-Ruet, separating this ridge from the Herpin, is the principal entrance to Cancale road from the north west ; but a shoal, named Basse du Milieu, with only 4 feet on it, lies 4A cables' to the north-east of the Herpin, and narrows this passage, which is otherwise deep enough to be used by vessels of any draught at all hours of tide. They should, however, borrow within a cable's length of the Herpin when passing it on the flood, as this stream sets strongly over the shoal and the Pierre de Herpin ; the flood begins to make in the passage about 5f hours before high water at St. Malo or Granville, and as it runs to the S.E. and E.S.E., there is no reason to fear of being drifted by it towards the Banchets. A rocky ridge, with from 22 to 24 feet on it, lies S. by E. a quarter of a mile from the Pierre de Herpin. La fille, the north-easternmost rock of these dangers, uncovers 1 1 feet at the lowest tides, and lies E. by N. A N. 3 cables' lengths from the Pierre de Herpin, and 2 miles on the same bearing from Grouin point. The marks for it are, the summit of the Herpin in one with the northern head of the Pierre de Herpin; and the Bigne rock seen between the Grand Chevreuil and Cezembre island. When the Pierre is covered, there will be 19A feet water on the Fille, and a vessel will be to the northward of them both when Grouin point is open to the northward of the Herpin, and to the southward when the point is open to the southward of the Herpin. Cape Frehel in one with the latter rock also leads to the southward.* There are 8f fathoms water in the passage between the Pierre and the Fille, and a vessel can pass through it in safety when the Pierre is un covered, by keeping from I1 to 2A cables from it ; but it would have the disadvantage of placing her too much to leeward, if seeking shelter from strong westerly winds in Cancale road. grande rade de cancale is situated to the northward of Ri mains island, at three-quarters of a mile from the shore, between the Chatry and the Corbieres bank, and affords excellent shelter for ships of large draught during westerly winds.

North-easterly winds sometimes cause a swell, but vessels are seldom obliged to weigh suddenly from a shift of wind ; it will, however, be prudent before furling to double reef the topsails. There is also good anchorage in the southern part of the road in 7 fathoms, over a clayey muddy bottom, at about 2 cables' lengths to the eastward of Rimains island, with the steeple of Cancale church in line with the middle of the fort on the island, W. f N., and Grouin point a little open to the westward of Landes island, N. \\ W. A vessel under 10 feet draught can anchor to the southward of Rimains island, with that island bearing North, distant half a mile; but in running for this anchorage at low water, keep within a quarter of a mile of the island, to avoid the. shoal patch of 10 feet on the Corbieres bank ; and if unable to ride here in heavy weather from the north-eastward, take the top of high water and run aground with good sail upon the mud to the southward of Cancale church, where both the vessel and the crew* will he saved.

The anchoring ground extends north and south, from the line on which Haut Bout mill is in one with the small white sandy beach (Portz Picain), situated close to the southward of Chatry point, to that on which Cancale church steeple is in one with the southern side of the Chatellier rock. The best berth is in 6 to 7 fathoms, blue tenacious ch-n-, with the steeple of the church in the town of Dol in line with the foot of the eastern slope of Mont Dol ; and the steeple of Cancale church between the Chatellier and the fort on Rimains. This position is the nearest to Rimains, but as it is about 1^ miles from it, that island will afford but little shelter from the westward. If intending to remain any time, the anchors should be sighted occasionally, as they bury themselves deeply, making it difficult to weigh. Merchant vessels generally prefer the anchorage to the southward of the Corbieres bank, where the holding ground is good, and the depths from 19 to 22 feet at low water. The best berth is close to the southward of the line on which Haut Bout mill is in one with the Cormorandiere rock, N.W. \\ N., with the mill between the northern point of Rimains island and the fort on that island ; but the safest position for them is in the southern part of Cancale road."], [358, "342 [chap. vii.

This is a good anchorage during the neaps, but at the springs the streams run from 4 to 5 knots. Small craft can anchor a little farther in shore, but not to the westward of the line on which Mont Dol is seen touching the western side of the Chatellier.

Vai-de point bears W. f N. 6 miles from Grouin point, and the rugged coast between is formed by a succession of valleys, which extend to the shore, and their openings, mostly sandy, are nearly on the level of high-water springs. The valleys are separated from each other by high points, bordered with steep rocks. The most remarkable of these points is that of Meinga, which lies 3f miles to the westward of Grouin point, and is nearly as high as Cape Frehel ; it is narrow and steep on all sides, and extends in a slope more than half a mile to the northward."], [359, "343 CHAP. \\ II.] POINTE DU GROUIN. BASSE GRUNE. Between Grouin and Meinga points there is nothing worthy of notice except a small bay formed between Nid and Nez points, in the inner part of which is a sandy beach defended by fort Duguesclin. The fort is erected at 3 cables' lengths to the south-west of Nid point, on a rocky islet joined to the shore at low water by a ridge of rocks. Midway between Meinga ancl Varde points is the little harbour of Roteneuf, which is greatly encumbered with sand, and the tide only begins to enter it at half flood. Vessels of large draught should keep at least 2 miles from the coast between Grouin and Varde points at all times of tide ; indeed, great precaution is always necessary when navigating between Grouin point and Cape Frehel, to avoid the numerous dangers lying scattered at a greater or a less distance from the shore. The principal of these are named, the Renardieres, Grune, Nid, Rault, Tintiaux, Rochefort, Bigne, Grands Pointus, &c. &c. banc des renardieres, composed of sand and shells, lies N.N.W. A W. If miles from the Herpin rock, and the soundings on it vary from 36 to 45 feet at low water. The bank is only a cable broad, and trends half a mile in a N. by W. and S. by E. direction, nearly across the streams, which cause a heavy sea on it during a weather tide. From its shoalest part the fort near Varde point appears midway between Grand and Petit Chevreuil, W. by S. \\ S., and the Herpin is in one with the north-east extreme of the hills, named Pointe de Gogre, (page 337) at the head of Mont St. Michel bay. BASSE grune is a dangerous isolated rock, with only 8 feet on it and 10 to 12 fathoms close around at low water, lying N.E. j E. 3^ miles from Meinga point, and N.W. by N. rather more than 3 miles from the Herpin. It occasions great overfalls, even in moderate weather, and is much in the way of vessels proceeding to Granville or Cancale road.

It has only 16 feet water over it, 9 to 10 fathoms around it, and, like the two former dangers, it should be carefully avoided at low tide by vessels of large draught, aud by small craft when it blows hard, as it causes a great swell. The marks for the Rault are, the semaphore on Garde Guerin point a little open to the southward of the Rochefort rock, W. by S. -^ S., and the eastern slope of Meinga point almost shutting in Terquete mill. The above semaphore in one with the fort on the Grande Conchee bearing W. by S. \\ S. leads to the north-west, and Mont St. Michel open and shut with the Herpin, S.E., leads well to the northward.

A patch of rocky ground lies half a mile to the northward of the latter rock, but there are never less than 5 fathoms upon it, though it occasionally ripples. st. malo. \u2014 The town of St. Malo is built on the small rocky island of Aaron, and communicates with the main land by means of a causeway, named Le Sillon, three-quarters of a mile long and 54 feet broad, which is defended from the violence of the waves by strong outworks. The whole area of the island is occupied by houses, and the walls arc flanked by iowers washed by the sea. The manufactures of the town are hosiery, fishing-nets, cordage, soap, fishing-nets, &c. &c. Shipbuilding is carried on, and there is a large tobacco factory. Vessels are fitted out for the foreign ancl coasting trade, and for the whale, cod, and mackerel fisheries. The imports consist of colonial produce, spices, flax, hemp, &c. ; there is also a considerable trade in corn, fruit, wine, brandy, salt, linen, cider, butter, honey, fish, salt pro visions, &e. In 1858 the total value of imports from England and the Channel islands (principally coal) was about 20,000/. ; and of exports to the same places (principally salted meat, grain, flour, butter, cattle, &c), about 290,000/. At the same period there were 241 vessels (not including coasters), measuring 54,947 tons, belonging to the port ; and 623, of 48,795 tons, entered inwards ; and 715, of 78,423 tons, cleared outwards. The population of the commune is about 9,383, but including the town of St. Servan, which is situated on higher ground and is sometimes reckoned a suburb of St. Malo, it probably exceeds 21,000. PORT de ST. MALO, situated to the south-eastward of the town, is large and well frequented, but difficult of approach, and the flood rushes in with great strength, equinoctial tides rising to the height of 43 feet above the level of low water. It is also inconvenient of access to vessels of large draught during the winter months, as the time of high water, full and change, occurs at 6h. 5m. in the evening. The port is about to be converted into a Bassin a Flot, or floating basin. A strong granite wall is thrown across the entrance, having two openings, which will be formed iuto locks with wide flood-gates. The width of entrance of the largest opening is 60 feet, and the tide rises above the bottom, which is 12 feet above the lowest springs, 28A feet at ordinary springs, 31 feet at great springs, and about 15 feet at neaps. * View 122. f View 123."], [365, "chap, vn-] EMBOUCHURE DE LA RANCE; PORT DE ST. MALO. 349 A neat substantial stone pier, called the Mole des Noires, is built on the Noires rocks at the south-west angle of the town, and in addition. to its great convenience for landing passengers, protects the port from the heavy roll of the sea, which it otherwise would be exposed to with north westerly winds. The pier is 1,290 feet long, and about 16 feet wide, and at its extremity is a light tower. Extensive quays, built of granite, border the east and south sides of the town of St. Malo ; that on the east side is about 70 feet wide, and most conveniently adapted for discharging cargoes. The ground at the foot of these quays is at preseut from 14 to 16 feet, and that alongside the quays at St. Servan 17 to 18 feet above the level of low-water springs, and at these tides vessels of the largest draught enter the port and moor alongside them ; but during the neaps not more than 12A feet draught can reach the former quays, and 9^ feet the latter. Vessels lying at the St. Malo quays are sheltered on all sides, except when the wind is strong from South and S.S.E. ; but those alongside the St. Servan quays, surge violently and are much exposed when it blowrs hard between North and N.E. light. \u2014 A fixed white light is exhibited, at 33 feet above high water, from the lighthouse on the Mole des Noires. The light is dioptric, and of the fifth order, and visible at 10 miles. There are 3 good roadsteads at the mouth of the river Ranee, where vessels of large draught generally anchor to unload, or await high tides to enter the port. They are named Rade de St. Malo, Mouillage de Dinard, and Rade de Solidor. rade de ST. malo is situated on the eastern side of the entrance to the Ranee, at 4 cables to the westward of the town of St. Malo, and occupies a space about If cables long, north and south, 1 cable wide, with 27 to 32 feet water over it at the lowest tides. It is bounded on the north by the Basse Broutard, on the east by a sand-bank which fronts the town and dries at low water, and to the southward by the Plateau de la Ranee, the northern head of which lies S. \\ E. a quarter of a mile from the Broutard.

The best position is in the middle of the road, with the eastern head *of the Bizeux in one with the high rock at the foot of Bechard point, S. \u00a7 E., and the telegraph on Garde Guerin point a little open to the southward of the summit of the Grand Vide, W. by N. \\ N. Vessels of lighter draught anchor a little to the eastward of this. Two buoys with strong chains are moored, one S.S.W. A W. half a cable, and the other S. \\ E. 2 cables from the Broutard. The road is sheltered from all winds but those between North and West, which, when they blow with any strength, send in a heavy sea during the time the dangers outside the river are covered. The streams in it are not strong, the flood never exceeding 3 knots, and the ebb, which Bechard point turns to the N.N.W., never running with sufficient strength to pre vent communication with the port. Sailing vessels wishing to leave the road for the port or a more sheltered anchorage in the river, when it blows hard from the westward, should not weigh till the latter stream has fairly made, to enable them to work to windward. There is also good holding ground, with a depth of from 18 to 22 feet over it, in the Petite Rade de St. Malo, at a short distance to the south ward and south-eastward of the Plateau de la Ranee. When at anchor in the centre of this road, the extreme of Bechard point will be in one with the middle of the Bizeux, and the outer angle of the bastion of St. Louis will be open about half a point to the southward of the pier head. anse de dinard This bay is formed abreast St. Malo on the western side of the Ranee, between points Dinard and Vicomte, and the grounding places in it extend along its western shore, from the old ship yard below the village to the new one beneath the mill on Dinard point.

This anchorage is just outside the outer edge of the mud in Dinard bay, and is half a mile in extent from the Petit Palais rock to the Schevre bank ; its outer limit does not extend to the eastward of the line on which the high rock named the Muriers (lying close to the south-west point of Cezembre island) is just open and shut with the eastern slope of Dinard point. The holding ground is good along the edge of the mud, out of the strength of the stream, with the mill of Champ Fleuri bearing S. by E. A E. The best anchorage, where the depths are from 26 to 30 feet at low water, is limited to the northward by the line on which Solidor tower is seen between the extreme of Bechard point and the little fort ; and to the southward by the same tower open its own breadth to the northward of the high steeple of St. Servan church. This roadstead is the general rendezvous for vessels of war, and is pre ferable to that of St. Malo, being sheltered against the prevailing winds ; but it will be prudent at all times to be ready to weigh or slip, if forced by bad weather to take shelter farther up the Ranee. anse et rade de solidor together form an important maritime position. Frigates have been built in the bay, but the water not being sufficiently deep for them in the road, they have been obliged to complete their armament in that of Dinard. Solidor bay, situated on the west side of the town of St. Servan, is a cable wide at the entrance, and its shores are almost entirely occupied by the military establishments of the town. Merchant vessels intending to remain some time in the bay are usually placed at the entrance, between the quai des Corbieres and the rocks lying at the foot of Solidor tower, where the bottom dries 12 or 13 feet above the level ofthe lowest tides, and springs rise from 25 to 32 feet, and neaps about 15 feet. A small grounding place, called Port St. Pere, is formed in the northern part of the bay, at the foot of the peninsula of La Cite. It is about 84 yards wide, 270 yards deep, and will contain 14 or 15 vessels of the tonnage and draught of those employed in the Newfoundland trade. The"], [368, "352 GRANVILLE TO CAPE FREHEL. [CHAP.

Solidor road is only a small deep, 2 cables long, north and south, and about 80 yards wide, formed between the beach which dries in front of Solidor bay and the Solidor bank, which also dries and extends parallel to the shore ; the soundings in it, however, are shallow, and long-heeled vessels occasionally take the ground, the greatest depth at low water being 18 feet. The road is sheltered on all sides at this time of tide, and when the bank is uncovered, but when it blows hard from the westward and the bank is covered, there is a considerable swell. Banc de solidor bounds Solidor road to the westward, and uncovers 8 feet at the lowest tides. Its north extreme is 85 yards to the southward of Bechard point, and from thence it extends 3 cables to the south-east, and terminates at 173 yards to the north-east ofthe Bizeux rock. It is about a cable broad, and composed of fine white sand mixed with broken shells. channels Leading into LA RANCE. \u2014 All the channels leading to Port St. Malo and into the river Ranee are situated between Garde Guerin and Varde points, in the midst of a chain of dangers running parallel to the coast between Ehbiens isle and Grouin point. These channels are formed amongst rocks, some of which are always above water and others that uncover between a quarter ebb and low water, and amongst sand-banks and shoals, some of which are dry or nearly awash at low-water springs ; several small islets, however, such as Cezembre, Grande Conchee, Harbour isle, and the Beys, and the high rocks, serve as good marks to avoid these dangers. The course of the Ranee extends out 3| miles to the north-west of Dinard point and St. Malo, through the Grande Porte channel, and having depths of from 4 to 5 fathoms in it at low water, can be navigated at all hours of tide by vessels of large draught. Besides this channel, and the Petite Porte to the north-east of it, there are five others through which the pilots take vessels at a proper time of tide; they are named the Decolle, which is close to the land to the south west of the Grande Porte ; the Petite and Grande Conchee ; the Petits Pointus ; and the Bigne. These four latter are to the eastward of the Grande Porte, between the island of Cezembre and the coast to the east ward of St. Malo. With easterly winds the pilots prefer entering the Ranee by the Conchee channels in preference to that of the Grande and of the Petite Porte, as they are not exposed during the flood to such violent eddies as are felt in the others with these winds."], [369, "353 CHAP, vn.] EMBOUCHURE DE LA RANCE ; PASSAGE DU DECOLLE. passage du decolle, lying close along the shore to the westward of the entrance to the river Ranee, between Dinard and Decolle points, can be navigated by vessels of moderate draught from half flood to half ebb ; in case of need, those of large draught might run through it with a leading wind during the springs, from one hour before till one hour after high water. The pilots use this channel in preference to the others when the wind is off the land from S.W. to S.S.E., as the sea is then smooth. It may also be taken with winds from N.W. to S.W. when bound into the Ranee; or when leaving St. Malo road or the river with north-easterly or south easterly winds.

The western entrance is between Decolle point and the Mouillere rock, and its breadth does not exceed half a cable at low water. directions. \u2014 Vessels entering the Decolle passage from the west ward generally pass between a small elevated island named Agot, lying a mile to the westward of Garde Guerin point, and a high isolated rock named the Nerput, which lies 8 cables to the northward of the point and uncovers 40 feet at the lowest tides. The lighthouse on \"the pier-head of St. Malo brought just open to the northward of the high rocks at the extremity of Decolle point, S.E. by E. \u00a7 E., will lead between the Nerput and the Grande Brousse bank, on which there are only 11 feet water (but at the time of tide this passage is navigable, there are at least 30 feet on it), and 2 cables' lengths to the northward of the Platier des Lardieres. Keep this mark on until the steeple of St. Hydeuc church comes in line with the summit of the Grand Buzard, E. by S. j S., and by following this direction it will lead in the deepest part of the western entrance of the passage, at about three-quarters of a cable to the southward of the beacon on the Mouillere rock. When the Grand Buzard is covered, keep Parame church and St. Hydeuc windmill in such a position between fort Royal and Harbour isle, as that the church shall appear the same distance to the northward of the fort as the mill appears to the southward of the isle. Having passed these narrows, La Latte fort must be brought in one with the Nerput, N.W. by W. A \\V., and the vessel run to the eastward with this western mark on, between the Petit Buzard and Petit Genillet rocks, both of which have beacons, until St. Enogat mill opens to the eastward of St. Enogat church ; from whence, by keeping the eastern angle of the citadel of La Cite between the semaphore of Grand Larron and the highest house of St. Servan, S.E. f E., it will lead into the fairway of the river between the Pourceaux rocks and Dinard point. The summit of the trees [e.c. \u2014 2.] a A"], [370, "354 GRANVILLE TO CAPE FREHEL. [chap. vii. surrounding the tower of the semaphore, and the large house with a chimney at each end and one in the middle, are easily recognized at a distance, as they overtop all the surrounding objects. At the neaps or during the springs, when the Mouille rock is more than 3 feet above water (it lies on the western end of the Pourceaux bank, and uncovers 39 feet at the lowest tides), a vessel must pass between Dinard point and the Pourceaux rocks, and for this purpose, as soon as the highest heads of the Cheminees rocks are in one with the summit of the Mouille, N.W. f N., steer S.E. f S., and by keeping these rocks in line, the vessel will pass 50 or 60 yards to the northward of a rock lying at the extremity of Dinard point, and which covers a little before half flood. During the springs, when the Mouille is covered, or less than 3 feet out of water, vessels of large draught can run over the bank between the Pourceaux and the Pierres d'Amourette rocks, there being at that time at least 4 fathoms over it. To cross the bank, bring the Grand Vide rock (which does not cover) in one with Garde Guerin telegraph. W. by N. N., then by steering E. by S. -j S., with these two objects in line, it will lead to the middle of the anchorage in St. Malo road, where vessels generally wait until there is sufficient water to enter the port. During the springs, vessels often pass to the northward of the Nerput, and enter the Decolle passage either by running between the beacon on the Mouillere and that on the Petit Pot de Beurre, or by passing close to the eastward of the beacon on the latter rock. When to the northward of the Nerput, and intending to enter the passage by the former route, bring St. Enogat church steeple in line wfth the middle of a little patch of white sand situated close to the westward of Roche Pelee point, S.E. f S., and it will lead 2 cables' lengths to the northward of a 19* feet patch, named Rat du \"Nord-Est, a cable to the north-east of the Basses des Marechaux, the same distance to the south-west of the Grande Basse and of the beacon on the Petit Pot de Beurre, and only 50 yards to the southward of a small rock which comes awash at low water and lies 170 yards to the south-west of the beacon. If intending to pass to the eastward of the Petit Pot de Beurre, from a position to the northward of the Nerput, steer to bring the mill of St. Enogat in line with the north extreme of the above little patch of white sand, S.S.E. f E., and these marks exactly in one will lead over a rocky patch named the Sauts aux Chiens (on which there are 10 feet at low water, and from 30 to 36 feet at half flood), and half a cable's length to the eastward of the beacon on the Petit Pot de Beurre. As soon as this beacon is passed, haul a little to the southward, to enter the passage and to avoid a small rock which lies a cable to the southward of the Grand Pot de Beurre, and uncovers 4 feet. As soon as the Nerput is in"], [371, "355 chap. vir.] EMBOUCHURE DE LA RANCE ; PASSAGE DU DECOLLE. one with La Latte fort, run to eastward with this western mark on, and proceed as before. From St. Malo Road to Solidor Road There are two dangers to be avoided when approaching Solidor road from that of Dinard or St. Malo. The first is the Rat de la Mer.i.'ii*, ;i small isolated rock, with only 4 feet on it, lying in mid-channel N.W. f N. a third of a mile from Bechard point. When the Pourceaux rocks are covered, there are 17 feet on this danger, and 22 feet when the tide reaches the foot of the beacon on the Pierres d' Amourette. The other danger is the Merciere ridge, lying half a cable to the westward of the peninsula of La Cite. The highest head on this ridge, which has a beacon on it, uncovers 20 feet at the lowest tides, and covers a quarter of an hour before half flood at the springs. Vessels bound to Solidor road, and having entered the river Ranee, may at neap tides pass either to the eastward or westward of the Rat de la Merciere ; but at springs they should keep as much as possible over on the right bank of the river, to avoid the strong tides, and pass to the eastward of the Rat. For this purpose, when abreast St. Malo, keep the eastern head of the Bizeux rock and the beacon on the Merciere in one, until the lighthouse on the pier head at St. Malo is in line with St. Malo church ; then steer to pass at the distance of three quarters of a cable to the westward and southward of the beacon on the Merciere. In case of necessity, a vessel may run between this beacon and the peninsula of La Cite, by keeping the lighthouse on the pier-head in line with the north-west side of the Calfats rock ; but this narrow passage had better be avoided as much as possible, as the tides run strong, and there are only 17 feet in it at low water. The most favourable time for entering the road is at the time of high water on the shore, for it being entirely exposed to the eddy of the flood stream, occasioned by the extension of Bechard point, vessels entering before that period will experience, when rounding that point, and for a space of about a cable's length east and west, the effects of the flood setting with great velocity to the S.W., and of the eddy, not less strong, setting 'to the N.W. The eddy begins to be felt near the shore about 2 hours before high water, and its breadth and strength increase as the tide rises. To enter the road, bring the tower of Grand Larron in line with that of Solidor, and it will lead between Bechard point and the Solidor bank. When within the latter, anchor as convenient ; the services, however, of a local pilot are necessary to obtain a safe position. a a 2"], [372, "356 [chap. vii.

They lie to the south-west of Cezembre island, and are divided by the Pierres des Portes rocks. They both unite between the Grand Jardin and the Pierres de la Savatte, at the entrance of the Grande channel of the Ranee, and may be used by vessels of the largest draught at all times of tide ; no square rigged vessel of burthen, how ever, should attempt either of them but with a free wind of sufficient strength to follow the leading marks and to stem the tide, and recollecting that the course, when within the narrows, is about S.S.E. \\ E. The Petite Porte channel can only be entered by passing through a chain of scattered rocks extending from W.N.W. to N.N.W. across the entrance, and the streams in their vicinity during the springs attaining a velocity of 4 or 5 knots, make them very dangerous at low water, and at all times, by the overfalls they occasion, when the wind is fresh on a weather tide. The westernmost of this rocky chain are the Buharats, the highest head of which, with only 7 feet on it, lies W.N.W. \\\\ miles from the tower on the Grand Jardin, with the Nerput rock in one with the summit of the mound on La Haye point, S.W. A \"VV. ; the telegraph on St. Malo church in line with Petit Bey fort, S.E. A E. ; and the fort on the Grande Conchee midway between the north point of Cezembre and Meinga point, E. -| S. The Pierres des Portes are three elevated rocks, the middle one of which uncovers 37 feet and lies N.W. by W. 6A cables' lengths from the tower on the Grand Jardin ; an iron beacon, with a ball on its summit, is placed on the westernmost rock, which dries 25 feet at low-water springs, and scarcely covers at high-water neaps. The Bunel, the north-eastern clanger of the chain, uncovers 12 feet, and lies N. | E. 6 cables from the above tower. The Hupions, on which there are 27 feet water, and the Grande Hupee, with only 4A feet on it, lie, the first 6, and the other 4-^ cables to the northward of the beacon on the Pierres des Portes. The Grande Hupee is very dangerous ; the marks for it are, the highest head of the Pierres des Portes in one with the summit of Bellefard point, S.S.W.

The former beacon, on the north side of this channel, stands on a rock which uncovers 19 feet at the lowest tides, and lies S. A W. 70 yards from the stone tower erected on the Grand Jardin, the summit of which is 13 feet above the level of the highest springs. The beacon on the south side of the channel is on the most eastern rock of the Pierres de la Savatte, named Pierre a la Vache, whicli uncovers 22 feet, and is awash at about half flood ; the beacon bears S.S.W. f W. 3 cables from the stone tower. A rocky bank, named Traversaine, lies in mid-channel, between the two beacons, and is dangerous at low water springs, as it is steep-to, and has only 4 or 5 feet on it at that time of tide. Grande Cbenal de la Ranee is 2\\ miles long, and extends from the Grand Jardin to St. Malo road. It is bounded on the western side by the Pierres de la Savatte, by the Pierre Salee flats, which have only 11 and 12 feet on them at the lowest tides, by an isolated conical rock named the Buron, which uncovers 24 feet and has an iron beacon on it surmounted by a ball, and by scattered rocky heads as far up as the Pourceaux rocks; and on the eastern side by the off-lying rocks of the Grand Jardin, by the Pierres Gamier, the highest head of which uncovers 5 feet, and by the rocky heads on the western slope of the Ouvras ridge, the greater part of which uncover at the lowest tides. The narrowest part of this channel is between a small rocky head, with only 3 feet on it, named Basse du Buron, and the beacon on the Buron rock, which bear E. by N. and W. by S. from each other, distant 1^ cables' lengths apart.

The old but useful mark for this channel was the south corner of the roof of the Caserne of St. Servan in sight to the northward of the north-east angle of the citadel of La Cite (a remarkable tree at the same time appearing in the opening). f When entering this channel at low water it will be necessary to avoid an 18 feet patch lying nearly half a cable to the south-west of the iron beacon of the Grand Jardin, and to do so keep the college touching the citadel until the beacon opens north of the mound, then edge to the southward for the fairway mark. A vessel will be to the eastward of the Traversaine bank when the mill of St. Lunaire comes within its own length of the Haumet rock. When rounding the Grand Jardin a good mark to lead to St. Malo road is, a large chimney in St. Servan open to the northward of St. Servan church, so as to see daylight between them, S.S.E. A E. Another mark for entering the channel of the Grande Porte, between the Buharats and the Pierres des Portes, and with leading winds this route is to be preferred to all others at low water, is the steeple of St. Enogat church in line with the eastern side of the Haumet rock, S. by E.

There is a beacon on the middle ofthe Normands ridge, erected on a rock which uncovers 12 feet ; also a beacon at the northern part of the Anglais ridge, on a rock which uncovers 10A feet. The above mark must be kept on until the mill of St. Lunaire, or the mound on Bellefard point, opens out to the southward of Harbour isle, when the vessel will be IA cables to the westward of the beacon on the Anglais, and must be edged more to the southward to bring the western head of the Bizeux in one with the high rock at the foot of Bechard point bearing S. \\ E., which mark will lead to St. Malo road. chenal de la grande conchee derives its name from the Grande Conchee rock, and, like that of the Petite Conchee, can only be en tered by vessels of large draught between half flood and half ebb. The entrance is bounded on its western side by the Haies de la Conchee, the Rimponiere, and the Grande Conchee, and on its eastern by the Rousses and the Plate ; and its position may be recognized by the fort on the Grande Conchee, which may be seen from a great distance. * View 129."], [376, "360 [chap. vii.

A W. three-quarters of a cable from the beacon. The sea almost always breaks on the Plate, and the beacon is often washed away. Several other patches are scattered about the entrance to this channel ; the most dangerous are the Beefer, the St. Servantine, and the Rat de St. Servan. The Basse de Beefer lies North 2| cables from the two north- westernmost heads of the Haies de la Conchee, and has 15 feet on it at the lowest tides. The St. Servantine is a dangerous isolated rock, which uncovers 2 feet at the lowest tides ; the marks for it are, the summit of the Ronfleresse in one with the foot of Garde Guerin point, and St. Hydeuc steeple in line with a mill which stands 4 cables to the S. by E.

The tides in this channel, between St. Malo and Varde point, never attain much strength at the springs, but they run strong to the* north east of the point. DIRECTIONS from CAPE de la HAGUE to ST. MALO through la deroute passage. \u2014 The shortest and best route from Cape de la Hague to St. Malo, with fresh leading winds, is through the Race of Alderney, and between Jersey and Sercq through La Deroute passage, the distance being about 70 miles ; it should, however, never be used by strangers at night, or during light winds, fog, or snow. If intending to take this route, enter the Race, if possible, on the slack or last of the north-east stream, which will be about 4 hours after high water at St. Malo, for at this period it presents no difficulty. Having cleared the Race steer with all possible sail about S.W. A W. to enter La Deroute passage in mid-channel, and to ensure passing to the south east ofthe Blanchard rock (page 205). This distance will be run in about 2A or 3 hours, or at about low water at St. Malo, and the course should be continued to the southward so as to be in a good position to the west ward of the Minquiers at the first of the flood. As this stream begins to be felt the more the vessel advances to the southward it will be neces sary to determine by correct bearings the course to be steered, and to pav strict attention to the directions already given in page 306 for avoiding those dangers. When clear of the Minquiers steer for Cape Frehel. where pilots are always on the look out. To St. Malo through Grand Ruet Passage. \u2014 The space separating tin islands of Guernsey and Jersey and the Minquiers ledge from the Roches Douvres, is called by the French pilots the Grand Ruet, and from its great breadth it would seem to offer a safe and easy route to St. Malo or Granville ; the streams, however, run through it with such velocity a: the springs, that should the stream and wind be in the same direction, a sailing vessel could not counteract their influence and avoid being drifted between the islands and the dangers in their vicinity. If surprised by fog or night the danger would be imminent, as from the continued changes in the set of the stream the reckoning cannot be depended on. It may be used at the neaps with a fresh northerly wind. but it will be prudent not to attempt it at the springs except under the following circumstances : \u2014 A vessel having a steady westerly wind and being in a position about 8 miles to the W.S.W. of the south-west extreme of Guernsey, at the commencement of the ebb, or 2\\ hours after high water at St. Malo. should steer S. \\ E. for a distance of 38 miles, or to about 6 miles N.W. b. N. from Cape Frehel."], [380, "364 [CHAP. VII. GRANVILLE TO CAPE FREHEL. This course will lead about 5A miles to the eastward of Maitresse isle on the Roches Douvres (which, if possible, should be sighted to correct the reckoning), 7 miles to the eastward of the Barnouic ledge, and 8 miles to the westward of the Minquiers. During the whole of this run the wind will be on the starboard side counteracting the effect of the stream, which for the first four hours will be on the port beam, the fifth hour a little on the bow, and lastly on the starboard beam, as the flood begins sooner as the coast is neared. To St. Malo through Cotentin Passage. \u2014 Directions have been already given in page 328, for navigating this passage when proceeding to Granville ; but if bound to St. Malo, and the vessel has arrived within 4 or 5 miles of the beacon on the Etat, (called also Petite Canue,) a remark able rock lying ou the northern edge of the Chausey group, keep away a little more to the westward to round the north-west part of the group at the distance of about IA miles. When abreast the Rondes de l'Ouest, a rocky ridge forming the west end of the above group, steer S.W. or more southerly, keeping within 3 miles of the rocks until the old castle, in ruins, on Grande- Ile opens to the southward of the Corbiere rock, E. b. S. f S., then edge away about S.W. A *w. for the entrance of one of the channels leading into the river Ranee. Great attention must be paid to make a proper allowance for the set of the stream, which in clear weather can easily be ascertained by bearings of the different objects on Chausey. At Night, when Chausey light is sighted steer for it on a S.W. bearing (see page 331), until within 2 miles of the Chausey group, then keep to the westward rounding the rocks at that distance. When abreast the west end of the group, haul to the southward, taking care, however, not to approach the rocks within 2 miles, and when the light bears E. f N., keep it so, and it will lead midway between the Sauvages, the Minquiers, and the French coast clear of all danger, until the light on Cape Frehel is seen, which ought then to bear about W. f S. With these two lights in sight, a position may be maintained off St. Malo so as at daylight to be in a fair way to enter the Ranee. To St. Malo from the Westward \u2014 When bound to St. Malo from the westward, with southerly winds, the island of Ouessant and the French coast may be kept aboard ; but with northerly winds and at night, a prudent distance should be maintained off shore until the flashing light on the Sept isles, and the fixed light on the Heaux rocks are made out. With the assistance of these lights, a departure may be taken from about 4 miles to the northward of the Heaux, and a S.E.

MALO ; DIRECTIONS Frehel about 6 miles to the northward of the Cape. The vessel will then be in a fair position to run for the entrance of the Ranee either through the Decolle passage or Grande Porte channel according to the state of the wind and tide. This route may be followed either on the ebb or flood stream, with the wind between N.N.E., round westerly, and South, but if between S.W. and South, it will be better, as soon as Cape Frehel light bears S.E. by S., to steer S.E. f S., to give the Cape a closer berth. With a fresh fair wind a tolerably fast sailing vessel leaving the meridian of the Heux lighthouse at the commencement of the flood, or 5 hours before high water at St. Malo, may, at the springs, enter the Ranee at high water, although the distance be about 48 miles ; but with a foul wind it will take two floods to make the passage. With a beating wind it will be better to wait for the commencement of the flood, making short tacks in sight of the Heux lighthouse, and then stretch into the channel between the Barnouic ledge and the Roc'h ar Bel. The boards in this channel should not exceed 2 miles in length, but when to the eastward of the Iloraine ledge, they may be extended without fear to 7 or 8 miles. By following these directions, Cape Frehel will be made towards the latter part of the flood, and the vessel may then be anchored or hove to under shelter of the Cape during the ebb. Weigh as soon as the flood makes, and continue working up so as to reach, at about half flood, the entrance of one of the channels leading into the Ranee. If bound to Granville, the above directions should be followed, giving Cape Frehel a berth of about 4 miles to avoid the Catis and the Vieux bank. Leaving the meridian of Heaux lighthouse at the beginning of the flood, that stream will take a vessel a little to the northward of Cezembre, when, if the wind is moderate, she can anchor, or make long boards to the eastward to counteract the influence of the ebb. DIRECTIONS from ST. MALO through COTENTIN PASSAGE. \u2014 Vessels leaving St. Malo intending to proceed round the west end of Chausey and through the Cotentin passage, should be clear of the island of Cezembre or the Grande Conchee in time to enable them to enter the passage with the first of the north-east stream, which will be at 34 hours before high water at St. Malo. From about a mile to the northward of the Grande Conchee, steer about N.E. f E., and the vessel will pass about 2 miles to the north west of the Rochefort, and 4 miles to the south-east of the Sau vages, if a proper allowance be made for the set of the stream. When within 3 or 4 miles of the Corbiere (the high remarkable rock lying at the south-west extreme of the Chausey group), steer to pass about I1 miles to"], [382, "366 GRANVILLE TO CAPE FREHEL.

Round the north-west end of the group at the same distance, passing about 2 miles to the south-east of the Ardentes, and when the beacon on the summit of Gros Mont is in one with the beacon on the Enseigne, S.b.W. AW., steer to the eastward to bring the beacon on the Etat in line with the beacon on the Huguenan, S.S.W. ; this latter mark will lead between the Shamrock knoll and the Marie ledge, when continue to the northward as before directed in page 334, endeavouring to run through the Race at the last ofthe south-western stream. If after the first-quarter flood, and unable to weather the west end of Chausey, bear up and pass round the eastern end. Granville church in one with the northernmost chimney of the south-western barrack will keep the vessel half-a-mile to the northward of the Videcoq rock ; and Coutances cathedral in one with Mont Martin church N.E. by E. A E. will lead between the Haguet and Admiralty banks, when proceed as before directed in page 334. From St. Malo through La Deroute Passage. \u2014 Vessels of large draught bound to any of the eastern ports in the Channel or the North Sea, leave St. Malo road as soon as the flood begins to slack, and with a fair wind, when clear of the channels leading out of the Ranee, they pass to the westward of the Minquiers and the islands of Jersey, Guernsey, and the Casquets. With the wind between South and West this distance might be shortened by those acquainted with the navigation, by running through La Deroute passage and the Race of Alderney ; for a vessel averaging 7 knots will, in 6 hours after leaving St. Malo, reach the middle of the passage, and from thence steering for the Race may, with a fresh fair wind, stem the remainder of the south-west stream. The Race would then be entered a little after the commencement of the north-east stream. French sailing vessels generally adopt this route, but to ensure entering the Race on the slack or last of the south-west stream, they wait at anchor for a leading wind under the isle of Ehbiens. From St. Malo to the Westward. \u2014 The precautions to be taken when leaving Granville for Cape Frehel have been already given in page 333. When bound round Ouessant from St. Malo, from a position about 5 or 6 miles to the northward of Cape Frehel, a N.W. A \"W*. course should be shaped to enter the channel between the Barnouic ledge and the lighthouse on the Heaux. This course continued 17 miles to the west ward of the meridian of the lighthouse will place a vessel 10 miles to the northward of the Sept isles and clear of all danger. TIDES. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at Port St. Malo at 6h. 5m., and the water rises above the bottom of the large opening into the port (this opening is to be converted into a lock with wide floodgates, and"], [383, "367 PORT DE ST. MALO ; DIRECTIONS. TIDES. CHAP. VII.] its bottom is 12 feet above the lowest tides), about 32 feet at great springs, 25 at ordinary springs, and 14 at neaps. The streams run with great strength at the springs at the entrance of the Grande and Petite Conchee channels ; the flood to the north-east, the ebb to the south-west. Their rate is about 4 knots at half-tide, across the entrance of the Grande channel of the Ranee, between the beacon on the Savatte and that on the Buron. To the southward of the latter beacon, the flood sets into the river with the same velocity. The ebb out of the river divides itself into two branches, the one following the direction of the Grande channel, the other of the Decolle passage. Both streams follow the direction of the latter passage, and run at about the same rate. ile des ehbiens, about a mile in circumference, lies at the head of the deep bight formed between St. Malo and Cape Frehel. It is sur rounded by high rocks, and near its centre there is a large conspicuous tower which may be recognized from a great distance. It is joined to the shore at low water by a bank of sand which borders the coast from the entrance to St. Briac to Cast point. Close to the south end of Ehbiens there is a well sheltered grounding place, much frequented by coasting vessels of about 10 feet draught, which await here for favourable winds when bound from Granville 01- St. Malo to the eastern ports in the Channel and intend passing to the westward of the Minquiers and Jersey. It is formed by a natural causeway of shingle, which is always uncovered and unites the south west extreme of the island to some high rocks lying 2 cables to the south-west. The bottom is composed of muddy sand and seaweed, and dries 7 or 8 feet above the lowest tides, which rise from 28 to 35 feet above it at the springs, and 18 or 19 feet at the neaps. The best place for grounding and sheltered from all winds, is about half a cable's length from the south end of the island, with Agot island entirely shut in by the south-east extreme of Ehbiens. directions. \u2014 When running for the grounding place at the south end of Ehbiens, as soon as the island is made out steer to pass about lA cables to the eastward of the Haches, a ridge of rocks, some of which are always uncovered, extending half a mile in a N.E. direction from its northern point.

It is situated at the"], [384, "368 GRANVILLE TO CAPE FREHEL. [chap. vii. entrance of a narrow valley IA miles to the eastward of Ehbiens and about three-quarters of a mile to the southward of the high projecting point of Haye. The entrance, 2 cables wide, is formed between the south end of Perron isle and a beacon erected on the extremity of a rocky ridge extending in a northerly direction from the peninsula of Lancieux. The rock on which this beacon is placed dries 15 feet at the lowest tides, and in entering the harbour a vessel should steer to pass about halt a cable to the northward of it to avoid some small rocky heads lying a full cable's length to the westward of the south end of Perron ; the highest of these heads, which is also the westernmost, uncovers 12 feet at the lowest tides. The channel into the harbour narrows considerably at half a mile within the beacon at the entrance, and a vessel will have to pass between rocky heads, marked by beacons, the highest of which uncovers 19 feet. The streams run with great strength, both in the harbour and in this channel, which is exposed to a heavy sea when it blows hard from the north-westward. The pilots place vessels in the middle of the harbour, with their heads in the direction of the ebb stream, to the W.N.W. of the town of St. Briac, on a bottom of sand and mud, on which the tides rise from 20 to 26 feet at the springs, and 12 to 13 feet at the neaps. There is a little bight formed in the northern part of the harbour, in which the bottom is of soft mud, and where vessels lie sheltered from the streams and all winds ; but if of more than 13 or 14 feet draught they will be neaped two or three days. riviere larguenon. \u2014 Vessels capable of taking the ground will find shelter from strong easterly winds on the eastern shore of the bay formed at the mouth of the Larguenon river. They should be placed abreast an old convent, with St. Jacut windmill bearing S.E., and Ehbiens islet shut in by Chevet point. The tides rise here from 19 to 26 feet at the springs, and 9^ feet at the neaps. The river is navigable up to Plancoet at the springs, for vessels of about 9 feet draught. Les bourdinots are two small rocky ridges, one lying 6 cables, and the other 1-A^ miles, E. A N. from St. Cast point. The easternmost ridge, on which there are 34 feet at the lowest tides, is only dangerous when blowing hard, but the westernmost, the highest rock on which dries 7 feet, must be carefully avoided. The marks for the latter rock are, Chesne windmill touching the west side of the Bec-Rond rock, W. by S. \u00a7- S., and St. Jacut windmill in line with the summit of the Colombiere islet, lying half a mile to the westward,"], [385, "369 CHAP.

Teignouse point (the first point to the southward of Cape Frehel) in line with La Latte point will lead a little to the northward of the Chelin bank, and between St. Cast point and the Bourdinots. A vessel will be to the eastward of this danger as long as Chesne windmill is well open to the eastward of the Bec-Rond rock ; and to the westward by keeping the mill open to the westward of the reck. \u2022 baie de la FRENAY, formed between St. Cast and La Latte points, affords good shelter with off shore winds, but is quite exposed to those from the N.E. The entrance is 2 miles wide, and from thence the bay trends 3A miles in a S.W. by W. direction to its head. The surrounding land of this bay is high, and its northern shore free from danger. The holding ground is good, and the best anchorage is in 4-J- to 5 fathoms, at about half a mile off La Cierge point, with Cape Frehel lighthouse seen between the latter point and La Latte fort. The only precaution to be used in taking up a berth is to make allowance for the fall of tide. Vessels under 9i feet draught can cross the high bank, which dries out upw-ards of 2 miles from the head of the bayr, and reach the beaching places of Portmieux and of Port-a-la-Duc.

Vessels ground on a bottom about 16 feet above the lowest tides, and are sheltered from N.N.W., round easterly, to South. The south side of the bay is formed by the lofty point of Lahoussaye, which is prolonged to seaward by an islet and some rocks. A jetty is constructed in the northern angle of the bay, at IA cables to the westward of a little hamlet, named La Chaussee, and it affords safe shelter against westerly winds to vessels capable of taking the ground. The bottom at the foot of the jetty head, which should be left to port on entering, dries 13 feet above the lowest tides. Erqui road, lying close to the southward of Cape Erqui, in front of Erqui bay, is the only anchorage on the eastern shore of St. Brieuc bay that will afford complete shelter from easterly winds.

To this end, having rounded the Cape, steer to the westward with the south end of the Amas-du-Cap touching the extre mity of the Cape, E. | S., and it will lead to the northward of the Jars, Truie, Malicorne, and Mouillee rocks which lie off the coast between the Cape and St. Michel islet ; the Mouillee, the highest and western most of these rocks, uncovers 13 feet at the lowest tides. Keep this mark on until the lofty and steep point of Pleneuf comes in sight to the W.S.W., and is in one with the rock forming the extremity of Cape Erqui ; then steer to pass a good cable's length from this rock, and round into the road. The most dangerous part of the Erqui channel is when Cape Erqui bears between S.S.W. and S. W.; the vessel will then be abreast and to the southward of rocky patches which dry 5 feet at the lowest springs. The Erqui channel may also be run for by passing between the patches lying between the Petite Liviere and the Justieres ledge, when there is sufficient water over them (the depth is never less than 16 feet over any of them), and the sea does not break in their eddies. The leading mark through is the guard-house on Pleneuf point kept in line with the rock at the extremity of Cape Erqui, (the new telegraph, which stands a little inland of Pleneuf point, being at the same time clear of the summit of the Cape) S.W. by W. f W., until the extreme of Cape Frehel is in one with the south end of the Amas-du-Cap, E. | S., when proceed as before.

N. By steering to the westward in this direc tion, or by keeping St. Michel islet in sight, and quite detached from Marre-aux-Rets point (the eastern point of the little bay immediately to the eastward of Cape Erqui), it will lead to the northward of the Portes d'Erqui ledge ; the extreme of Cape Frehel, kept in line with the large pointed rock at the foot of Cape Erqui, will lead to the southward of this ledge, and to the northward of the Jaunes. After passing to the southward of the Comtesses, which are clear of danger on this side, keep their highest summit in line with the Rohinet, E.

The first channel, when coming from the eastward, is between the Petit Lejon and the Pierres du Banc (page 378), and is practicable for vessels of the largest draught after the period of half flood. There are three sand-baDks lying"], [398, "382 CAPE FREHEL TO LES HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE, [chap, vim in it, but they are only dangerous from the heavy sea they occasion when it blows hard on a weather tide ; the largest, on which there are 5 fathoms at low water, lies in the direction of Tournemine mill in line with the Verdelet rock, S.S.W. \u00a7 W. In running through this channel keep Tournemine mill in one with the highest summit of the Comtesses bearing S. by W. f W., until Turquet mill comes in line with Trois Pierres point, S.S.E. $ E. Follow this latter mark until within half a mile of Cape Erqui, when steer for Erqui road. A vessel will keep to the eastward of the Petit Lejon by having the Verdelet rock open to the eastward of the summit of the Comtesses ; she will also pass to the eastward of the Comtesses patch, by having Tournemine mill well open to the eastward of the Comtesses ; and so long as Turquet mill is in sight to the eastward of Lahoussaye point she will not be too close to the eastern part of the Portes d'Erqui. The dangers on the eastern side of the channel will be avoided by not standing to the eastward of the line on which Turquet mill is just touching the high land of Cape Erqui. The channel between Le Rohein and Le Petit Lejon may be taken when seeking shelter in Erqui road, either on the flood or the ebb. The summit of the Comtesses kept in line with the south extreme of Bien-Assis wood, S. by E. A E., will lead half a mile to the westward of the Grand, and 2 cables to the westward of the Petit Lejon. Steer with this mark on until Turquet mill is in one with Lahoussaye point, S.E. S., which will lead into the road. In following this route before the period of half flood, care must be taken to avoid the Dahouetins and Comtesses patches, and the Izard rock on the southern side of the channel, and the Petit Lejon on the northern side; also, at low water and in bad weather, a 21 -feet patch lying S. by E. \\ E. three-quarters of a mile from the Petit Lejon. The Channel between Le Rohein and Les Jaunes is sufficiently deep for vessels of moderate draught, even at low water, when seeking shelter in Erqui road from easterly winds. In standing to the northward, Cape Frehel lighthouse kept open to the southward of the summit of the Comtesses will clear the southern part of the Rohein ledge ; and the light house in line with the large pointed rock at the foot of Cape Erqui will clear the southern part of the Portes d'Erqui. In making the southern board, the lighthouse kept open of the northern extreme of Cape d'Erqui will keep the vessel to the northward of the Jaunes; and Turquet mill well on with the steep coast which separates the beach of Erqui bay from the beach of the large bay to the southward will keep her to the northward of the Ecarets rocks, which uncover 2 feet at the lowest springs.

The coast between Pleneuf and Roselier points, which bear East and West of each other distant 6| miles, falls back to the southward and forms the head of St. Brieuc bay, in which are situated Port de Dahouet, Anse d'Yffiniac, and Port du Legue. Several dangers front this part of the shore, of which the farthest in the offing are named the Dahouet, Trois Pierres, Basse Herbaut, and the Trahillions. The Dahouet and the Herbaut rocks are awash, and the Trois Pierres have only 2 feet over them at the lowest tides. The Trahil lions form a rocky ledge, about three-quarters of a mile in extent, East and West, at the edge of the bank, which, abreast Guettes point, dries more than a mile from the shore at low water great springs ; the ledge is terminated on the eastern side by a rock which uncovers 23 feet, and on the western by another which uncovers 8A feet. A vessel will pass in the offing of these dangers by keeping the Rohinet rock in line with the highest head of the Jaunes, E. by N. f N. ; and to the westward of the Trahillions, by keeping the northern tower of the new church of St. Michel (in the town of St. Brieuc), between the southern tower (on which there is a telegraph) of the same church and the most southern houses of the hamlet, named Sous la Tour. This hamlet stands in front of Cesson tower, at the foot of the high land which forms the left bank of the entrance to the river Legue. port de dahouet. \u2014 The entrance to this little inlet, situated IA miles to the south-west of Pleneuf point, is comprised between the shore and the pier-head, which on entering must be kept to starboard. The port is open to the north-west, but it affords good shelter to vessels that can take the ground. The bottom dries 13 feet above the level of the lowest tides abreast the pier-head ; 18 feet in front of the western part of the quay ; about 22 feet at the angle of the quay ; and 24 feet near the mill sluice at the head of the port. directions When bound to Port Dahouet from the westward, follow the directions given in page 375 for passing between the Barnouic and Horaine ledges. With northerly winds the most direct route is through Brehat channel, which should be taken at the commencement of the flood ; this stream begins an hour sooner and runs with greater velocity in this channel than in the offing."], [400, "384 CAPE FREHEL TO LES HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE, [chap. viii. In running through Brehat channel (page 396), when Paon point, the north extreme of Brehat isle, is in one with the Heaux lighthouse, N.W. | N., haul to the south-east, and steer with this latter mark on until the two mills of Lande Blanche are in line with Lemenez isle, W. A N. ; the vessel will then be about H miles to the westward of the Sable banks, and a S. by E. course will lead between the Rohein and the St. Quay rocks. When to the southward of the Rohein, which bears N. f W. from the entrance of the port, the only dangers to be avoided are the Bignons, the Basse Godiche, and the Dahouet rocks. The Bignons lie on the south west edge of the Jaunes ridge, and uncover 24 feet ; when they are awash there is plenty of water over the Godiche, and 10A feet at the entrance of the port. The Godiche is a small patch of 7 feet lying half a mile to the westward of the Bignons, in the direction of the Petit Bignon a little to the southward of the summit of the Jaunes. The small steeple of Pleneuf seen over the downs, and open about half a point north of the steep coast to the northward of the port, will lead to the northward of the Dahouet, which lies three-quarters of a mile to the W.N.W. of the entrance, and is awash at low water. With the wind between S.W. and S.S.E. the vessel must pass to the east ward of the Horaine, after rounding which (page 375), take care she is not set too far eastward by the flood. When south of the Grand-Lejon, in standing to the eastward, do not open the summit of the Comtesses to the westward of the south extreme of Bien-Assis wood, to avoid the Petit- Lejon ; and in approaching the Rohein ledge, keep Guettes point well open to the westward of the Rohein rock, until the vessel is to the south ward of the rock. In standing to the westward be careful not to approach too near the St. Quay rocks ; Pature point kept open to the westward of Mener-Bel-Air mountain (at least double the apparent distance between its eastern and western peak), will lead a safe distance to the eastward of them, and when Cape Frehel lighthouse is in line with the summit of the Comtesses, or Etables steeple bears W.N.W., she will be to the southward of their south-east extreme. At Night, after rounding the Horaine, in order not to be set too far eastward by the flood, endeavour to keep in soundings of about 18 fathoms.

A mole extends from the shore at 273 yards to the eastward of the eastern jetty, and forms with this jetty an outer port, the depth in which at high water is from 3 to 6 feet greater than in the port. The outer port can be entered by vessels of about 10 feet draught at high water ordinary neaps, and those of 14 feet can enter it from 1-j hours before to 1^* hours after high water springs.

With strong winds from N.E. to East a vessel should always pass to the eastward, but before venturing so far into the bay a calculation should be made that the tide has risen suffi ciently high in front of the port (making a deduction for the 'scend of the sea), to prevent grounding. If compelled by high winds from N.W. to North to run for shelter at the springs in the outer port of Binic by passing between the St. Quay rocks and the coast, bring the Four rock in line with Ville Raout tower (a white tower on which there was formerly a telegraph), bearing S. f W. This mark will lead between the northern part of the St. Quay rocks and St. Marc bank, and should be kept on until the vessel has arrived at 3^ cables to the N.E. by E. of St. Quay point, or the Mauve rock is in one with a large conspicuous white house in the middle of Plouzec village, N.W. by N.

When Etables steeple comes in one with that of Plourham, N.W. by W.

If passing to the eastward of the St. Quay rocks, which it will always be prudent to do at the neaps, it is found after rounding their south-east extreme that the vessel cannot fetch Port Binic, shelter should be sought under Roselier point, on the northern shore of Port Aurelle (page 385), the grounding places in which, muddy sand, are only 3 feet above the lowest tides, and accessible to vessels of 14 feet draught at the springs, from 2 hours before till 2 hours after high water. tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, in Port Binic at 6h. 3m., and springs rise from 15 to 21 feet above the berths at the foot of the eastern jetty, and ordinary neaps about 6 feet.

PORT de portrieux, formed in the northern part of Portrieux bay at half a mile to the southward of St. Quay point, is used by vessels that can take the ground, but its access is difficult without the assistance of a pilot. The entrance is comprised between the coast and a jetty which extends from the north point of the bay, and on the head of which at"], [405, "CHAP. VIII.] 389 BAIE DE ST.

A rock, named the Gourvelot, lies in the middle of the entrance, but it may be passed on either side. If passing to the northward keep St. Michel mill in line with the pier head, N.W. A W., until close up to the jetty head, which on entering must be left to starboard. The best berth in this port is abreast the middle of the jetty. The bottom dries 12 feet above the lowest tides at the foot of the jetty head, 13 feet abreast the middle of the jetty, and 20 feet at the angle the jetty forms with the quay. When the Gourvelot covers, or the Madeaux rock at the north-west part of the St. Quay group (they both uncover 20 feet at the lowest tides), there are 6 feet water abreast the middle of the jetty and 5 feet at the jetty head. Vessels are moored with their heads towards the jetty, but far enough to prevent their bows touching it when the surf is high. rade de portrieux, between the St. Quay rocks and the coast, has good holding ground and sufficient depth for vessels of not more than 14 feet draught. It should not be used, however, with strong easterly winds, except at the lowest neaps, and then only when there is an im possibility of reaching a place of shelter on the eastern shore of the bay, either in Erqui road or under Pleneuf point. The anchorage in this road is comprised between the following limits : \u2014 The Hergue and Pommier rocks in one ; the Hergue in line with the foot of the steep declivity of Plouha point ; Caruhel mill in line with the summit of the Four rock ; and Portrieux church in line with the centre of the jetty of Port Portrieux. The depths are from 14 to 18 feet at the lowest tides, between the southern limit of the anchorage and the line on which St. Michel mill is in one with the end of the jetty. In this latter direction, from west to east, there are from 10 to 20 feet, and from 11 to 12 feet between this direction and the northern limit of the anchorage. The best berth and the most water is, with Etables steeple in one with the Four rock, and St. Michel mill and the end of the jetty in line. tides. \u2014 The tidal streams in Portrieux road follow nearly the direc tion of the Hergue and Pommier rocks in line. At the springs the greatest strength of the flood between Harbour isle and St. Quay point, as well as among the rocks to the northward of the road, is 4A knots ; the strength of the ebb is rather less. The COAST from St. Quay point trends 7 miles in a N. by W. direction to Minar point, and is high, steep, and inaccessible, except for boats with off-shore winds on the beach fronting the village of St. Quay, about 3 cables to the westward of St Quay point, and on the beach of Brechech"], [406, "390 CAPE FREHEL TO LES HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE, [chap. viii. bay at about If miles to the southward of Minar point. This point may be recognized' from a great distance by a white pyramid, a guard-house, and an old semaphore on its summit ; it is bordered by nu merous rocks which bar its approach to within 3 cables' lengths at low water. Plouzec point, at IA miles to the northward, is nearly as high as Minar point, and near it are three remarkable islets, the highest of which is named Mets de Goelo. Bee de Ver point is 1-^ miles from St. Quay point and abreast it, and a good half mile from the shore, is the north extreme of St. Marc bank, which from thence trends about a mile to the southward, parallel to the shore, and carries a depth of about 3 fathoms at low water. Plouha point, at I1 miles to the N.N.W. A w. 0f J5ec ,je yir, js the highest point in St. Brieuc bay ; it terminates in a perpendicular rocky cliff, visible in clear weather at 25 miles. The land between Minar point and the remarkable hill named Creach ar-Maout (noticed in page 372), is high and visible in clear weather from a distance of 22 miles ; its highest parts are, the hill on which the village of Plouzec is built ; La Trinite point, at 3 miles to the north-west of Plouzec point ; and Arcouest point at a mile to the northward of La Trinite. Arcouest point, with a guard-house on its summit, is as high and steep as Minar point, and, when coming from the westward, it is the first high point on the east coast of St. Brieuc bay that will open out to the eastward of Creach-ar-Maout hill. The Place de Greve, the Traverse, and the Oiseaux, are shoal patches lying nearly on the parallel, and from IA to 2\\ miles from Plouha point. The former, the shoalest and nearest the shore, carries a depth of 3 fathoms, and from it the southern mill of Plouzec is in line with the centre of the Mauve rock ; the other two patches have from 5 to 7 fathoms over them. The Mauve is a large rock lying 4 cables from the shore, and 3 cables to the north-east of the Pommier ; it never covers, and forms with other'rocks which surround it a ledge 4 cables long, east and west. anchorage The shore between Plouha and Minar points is clear of danger, and with off shore winds can be approached within half a mile at low water. The Taureau rock, which uncovers 33 feet, at the lowest tides, lies in the bight of the coast between the Mauve rock and Minar point, but it is only dangerous when covered ; by keeping the pyramid on the Cormorandiere rock open about half a point east of Minar point, it will lead to the eastward. With the wind between E.N.E. and South a vessel should avoid approaching too near this part of the coast, as the streams set into the bight. If obliged by a calm to anchor, endeavour to do so when the"], [407, "391 CHAP. VIII.] BAIE DE ST. BRIEUC ; ANSE DE PA1MP0L. steeple of Treveneuc church is in line with the Comtesse de Gueredan, a large rock lying at the foot of Plouha point, bearing S. A W. tides. \u2014 At half-flood an eddy runs to the N.N.W. in the same direc tion as the following ebb from St. Quay to Plouzec point, also in Paimpol bay, as far as Arcouest point ; its strength will be found greater in the bights than off the straight parts of the coast. anse de paimpol This deep bay, formed between the high points of Plouzec and La Trinite, is entirely dry at the lowest tides. Guilben point divides the bay into two parts, and it is to the northward of this long point that Port Paimpol and the principal beaching places are situated. The port is inaccessible at the neaps, and has but from 13 to 19 feet water in it at high water springs ; the entrance is between a pier head and the north extreme of some quays. Mouillage de Paimpol. \u2014 There is anchorage to the S.W. and S.E. of St. Riom isle, in the narrow channel separating the mud banks which dry at the south end of this isle from those in Paimpol bay. A vessel will have a good berth by mooring, north and south, to the south-west of the isle in 5 fathoms at low water, muddy bottom, with the guard-house on Arcouest point in line with the northern extreme of La Trinite point, and the pyramid on the Cormorandiere rock between the Denou rock and the north-west rock of the Roho ledge. There is not much sea here, even during strong easterly winds, except at high water. The holding ground at the anchorage to the south-east of St. Riom isle is good, but exposed to easterly winds. It lies in the direction of the beacon on the Ar-Zel rock in one with the summit of Blanche de Guilben isle, W. f S. ; its north-east limit is the Heaux lighthouse just opening out behind Arcouest point ; and its south-west limit is the guard-house on Minar point a little open to the eastward of Plouzec point. Beaching Places. \u2014 Port Lazo, situated in the south-east part of Paimpol bay under the high land of Plouzec point, is a good position to beach a vessel of moderate draught that can take the ground. The berths do not dry more than 9-^ feet above the lowest tides, and are well sheltered from East to South. The other grounding places in this bay are in front of Port Paimpol, to the northward of Guilben point, and the most frequented are situ ated on the flat between the channel and the rocks which border^the shore from the port to the point. The bottom is of mud and sand, and dries about 16^ feet above the lowest tides. The sea is rough'here at high water when it blows hard from the eastward, but the bottom is soft, and the sea falls before the vessel takes the ground."], [408, "392 CAPE FREHEL TO LES HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE, [chap.vih. There is also a good beaching place between the extreme of Guilben point and Blanche de Guilben isle. The best berth is about 1-J cables to the northward of the isle, where the bottom is soft mud, and elevated about 10 feet above the lowest tides. Another good position, where vessels lie up during the winter, is in the northern part of the bay, in front of the hollow formed by the shore under a high part of the coast called Lande de Portz-don. A vessel drawing IO1 feet will here be only neaped one day. PASSAGES LEADING to ANSE de paimpol. \u2014 There are five channels leading to the above anchorages to the southward of St. Riom isle, but they lie in the midst of the dangers fronting Paimpol bay, and only two of them, the Jument and the Denou, are practicable without a pilot ; the others are called the St. Riom, the Lastel, and the Trinite. Passage de la Jument. \u2014 The entrance to this channel is about IA miles to the northward of Plouzec point, between two remarkable large rocks a mile apart in a N. by E. A E. and S. by W. A \"\\v. direction, the one named tbe Ost-Pic lying at the eastern extreme of Mets de Goelo islet, and the other at the south-east extreme of the Roho ledge. The channel is shallow at low-water springs, but at half-flood there are 22 feet on the bank extending from the south part of the Roho ledge to the Jument rock. The Jument, Gueule, and Gouayan rocks divide this channel into two parts, both of which are practicable for vessels of moderate draught. The former rock uncovers 7^ feet, the Gueule 3 feet, and the Gouayan 16 feet at the lowest tides. The Jument and the Gouayan have beacons on them ; the Gueule lies midway between the beacons, about half a mile tothe E.S.E. ofthe Jument. Passage du Denou is close to the eastward of St. Riom isle, between the Garap and Rohan- bier ledges, to the eastward of a large rock named the Valve, and to the westward of the Guillaume and Denou rocks; the latter rock lies about a quarter of a mile to the E.S.E. of the eastern point of St. Riom. This channel has the advantage of lying in the direction of the flood stream, but it is narrow, and with the space which separates it from Brehat isle can only be navigable by local pilots, with a fair wind. After half-flood, if the leading mark is made out, a vessel can run through without risk. Passage de St. Riom is the narrowest of all the channels leading to Paimpol bay, and is but seldom used. It lies close to the north-vrcst side of St. Riom isle, between that isle and the Vras rock. Passage de Lastel is a narrow channel formed to the southward of the Men-Gam rock and of the rocky ledge extending from the south end of"], [409, "393 CHAP. VIII.J BAIE DE ST. BRIEUC ; ANSE DE PAIMPOL. Blanche de l'Arcouest isle. It is through this channel that pilots gene rally take vessels bound seaward from Paimpol. Passage de la Trinite, the entrance to which is to the southward of Brehat road between the Piliers rocks and those off the north end of Blanche de l'Arcouest isle, is generally taken by vessels bound to Paimpol under charge of local pilots, who have conducted them through either the Moisie, the Men du Castrec, or the Kerpont channels (page 398) It unites with the Lastel channel at half a mile to the northward of La Trinite point. directions. \u2014 When bound from the south-east to the anchorages under St. Riom isle, or to any of the beaching places in Paimpol bay, a vessel will pass between the Ost-Pic and the Calemarguiers rocks, and between the coast and the off-lying shoals between Minar and Plouzec points, by keeping the summit of ihe large rock lying at the south-east part of the Roho ledge in one with the eastern point of Ar-Morbic isle, bearing N. A E. This isle is on the eastern side of Brehat, and on the above bearing appears part of it ; its eastern point is high and well defined, and is the extreme of land seen to the northward. Give the Ost- Pic a berth of about 2 cables in rounding it, and from thence steer for the anchorages or grounding places, passing to the southward of the beacons on the Gouayan and Jument. If bound to Paimpol bay from the northward, and intending to run through the Denou channel, having passed through Brehat channel (page 396) steer to the S.W. by S. with Rundavi mill in line with the summit of the Denou rock. After passing to the westward of this rock, the beacon on the Ar-Zel rock kept in one with the summit of Blanche de Guilben isle, W. | S., with lead to the anchorage to the south-east of St. Riom isle, or the vessel may be steered for one of the beaching places in the bay. If the Jument channel be preferred, having run through Brehat channel bring the Ost-Pic in one with the pyramid on the Cormorandiere, S.S.W., and the vessel will pass to the eastward of Cain ar-Monse (a rock awash at the lowest tides) ; when to the southward of this rock, or when the guard-house on Arcouest point bears W. A ~S., steer to the south-east to bring Plouzec mill in line with the eastern fall of Mets de Goelo islet, S.W. by S. Do not come to the westward of this line and it will lead a cable to the eastward of the Cormorandiere bank. Plouzec mill in one with the Ost-Pic, S.W., will then lead to the eastward of the Charpentiers ledge, and to the entrance of the channel. tides. \u2014 The flood stream which enters Paimpol bay, after rounding the south-west part of Brehat isle, sets to the S.S.W. and S.S.E. ; but at about four hours flood its direction is S.S.W. and S.W., and an eddy begins to follow the windings of the shore from Mets de Goelo isle"], [410, "394 CAPE FREHEL TO LES HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE, [chap. viii. towards Arcouest point. The breadth of this eddy increases rapidly ; at one hour before high water it extends to the anchorage to the south east of St. Riom isle, and at this period, and even after half flood, a vessel running from Brehat road to Paimpol with a light wind, had better pass to the eastward of St. Riom isle, and even of the Cormorandiere rock, than through Trinity channel, which can only be done when the wind is sufficiently strong to stem the eddy. The ebb stream follows the same direction as the eddy on the flood, and forms an eddy behind each projecting point of the coast ; but in propor tion as the banks uncover, the body of the stream trends more and more towards Brehat, to the southward of which it divides into two parts, one part passing to the eastward of the isle, and the other, after crossing Brehat road, runs through Kerpont channel, and between the islets and rocks to the westward of it. The velocity of both streams increases in the narrow channels, but about the Cormorandiere bank, as well as to the eastward of Mets de Goelo isle and of Minar point, it does not exceed four knots at the springs, and two knots at the neaps. ile brehat lies one mile to the northward of Arcouest point, and the most apparent objects on it are, St. Michel chapel, the northern mill, and the southern mill (named Vieux-Moulin,) which has no sails, its roof painted red, and a zone 9 feet wide whitewashed below the roof. The most remarkable irregularities of outline are Paon point, forming the north-east extreme of the isle ; the small hill on which the above chapel stands ; and the hillocks crowning the eastern and western points of entrance to Port Clos. The isle appears distinct from the coast when it is on a South, S.W., or North bearing, but unless very near it, it will be blended with the land when it bears W.S.W. and N.W. The white pyramids placed on the Ar-Morbic, Louet, and Quistillic rocks, which front the eastern part of the isle, are also conspicuous objects and may be seen at some distance off. The dangers surrounding this isle are comprised between the line on which the Heaux lighthouse bears West and that on which the mill, situated on the high land a little to the northward of Pomelin bay, is in one with the south-west point of Brehat, N.W. by W. The streams, especially at the springs, rush with great velocity through this chain of dangers, and produce a violent race, which can only be crossed without risk at low water in the narrow cut called Brehat channel. This channel, which is 2 miles long in a S. f W. and N. f E. direction, passes about a mile to the eastward of Paon point, between the rocky ledges fronting the eastern side of the isle and the Echaudes ledge."], [411, "BAIE DE ST. BRIEUC ; ILE BREHAT. 395 CHAP. VIII.] pilots.\u2014 The Brehat and the Poutricux river pilots keep out at sea when the weather permits. In fine weather fishing boats are often found in the locality of the HiSaux lighthouse, and the masters of them, who are generally good pilots, will be found very useful until the coast pilots are met with. Rade de Brehat, on the south side of Brehat isle, is the only place between the Heaux lighthouse and Cape Frehel in which vessels of moderate draught can find shelter during strong winds from N.N.E. to N.N.W. The good holding ground trends east and west, in the direction of the guard house on Bois isle (a high steep islet lying off the west point of the entrance to Pontrieux river) in one with the southern face of a high rock named Men-ar-Vran, W. by N. A. N. ; its eastern limit is the eastern face of Mets de Goelo islet in one with the Men-Gam rock, S. jE. and its western limit, St. Barbe mill in line with La Trinite point, S.S.W. The best anchorage is with the above guard-house in one with the south face of the Men-ar-Vran, and St. Barbe mill, or the trees of St. Barbe chapel (this chapel is on the high land at the head of Paim pol bay, at lA cables to the westward of the mill) in line with the sum mit of Blanche de Arcouest isle, S.S.W.AW. The least depth in the road is 3 fathoms at low water. A vessel should moor E.S.E. and W.N.W. Port la Chambre. \u2014 If surprised in Brehat road with strong easterly winds, a vessel that can take the ground will find good shelter in Port Chambre, which is formed between the south-east part of Brehat isle and the Logodec and Lavrec rocks. It dries out at low tide, and its principal entrance, about half a cable wide, is between the rocks at the south-east point of the isle, and those adjacent to the western side of Logodec. A vessel cannot proceed farther into this port than the large islet lying abreast the north end of Logodec, and which divides the channel into two branches. The best berth is about three-quarters of a cable to the south ward of the islet, where the bottom dries about 9 feet above the lowest tides. A clump of trees surrounding St. Barbe chapel, bearing S.S. W A W., and touching the eastern side of a large rock named the Chateau-de l'lle- Blanche, will lead to the entrance. Port Clos, situated on the southern side of Brehat isle between the southern entrances of Kerpont passage and Brehat road, although difficult of access can, under most circumstances, afford refuge to vessels capable of taking the ground. Three rocks, lying in a straight line, N.E. and S.W., divide the entrance of this port into two parts. The most southern, named Men Allan, lies near low water mark, and uncovers about 19 feet ; the second is about half a cable farther in, and also uncovers 19 feet ; and the third"], [412, "396 CAPE FREHEL TO LES HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE. [chap. vm. is about a cable to the northward of the second, and uncovers 26 feet. This latter rock has been joined to the western shore of the port by a causeway, which serves as a landing place, and which, when uncovered, shelters the inner part of the j)ort. The bottom at the foot of the cause way dries 85 feet above the lowest tides ; the best berth is at half a cable to the N.N.E. of the rock at the end of the causeway, where the bottom dries nearly 11 feet above the same level. The greater number of vessels that enter the port do not go within the causeway, but lie about half a cable to the S.S.E. ofthe rock ; the grounding places here are good, but the anchors have but little hold, and at high water they are exposed to winds between W.S.W. and S.S.E. Port de la Corderie, on the north-west side of Brehat isle, is another grounding place where vessels of moderate draught will find shelter when in charge of local pilots. Its entrance, which is only half a cable wide and open to the westward, is close to the southward of a small rocky ledge lying three-quarters of a cable to the south-east of a large rock, named Kervarec. Vessels lie aground from the entrance to the head of the port. The best berth for those of about 15 feet draught is at 2 cables inside the entrance ; the sea is rough here only when it blows hard at high water springs. Small coasters lie to the eastward of this position, and sometimes in the middle of the little cove at the head of the port, where the tide rises from 5 to 6 feet less than in the channel. DIRECTIONS for approaching RADE de BREHAT from WESTWARD. \u2014 If obliged to seek shelter in this road from strong winds between N.N.W. and N.N.E., when pilots cannot come out in the offing, wait if possible to the N.N.E. of the Heaux lighthouse till half flood, when the tide will have risen in the vicinity of Brehat isle, and also in St. Brieuc bay, 181 feet at great springs above what it is marked on the charts. At this period a vessel can run through Brehat channel into Brehat load without risk, for the channel, which is only 2 cables wide at low water, will then be half a mile. Through Chenal de Brehat. \u2014 Having rounded the Roc'h-ar-Bel ledge (page 375), the leading mark through Brehat channel from half flood to half ebb is, the pyramid on the Cormorandiere rock in line with the pyramid on Minar point, bearing S. by W. A vy ; but if before half flood the former pyramid must be kept between the second and third group of houses seen on the high land between Plouha and Minar points ; this latter mark will lead to the westward of three shoal patches on the Echaudes ledge, the most southerly of which, named Roc'h-Couban, has only 8 feet over it at the lowest tides. By following cither of these leading marks, according to the time of tide, a vessel will pass to the"], [413, "BAIE DE ST. BRIEUC ; ILE BREHAT. 397 CHAP, viii.] westward of the Pain-de-Bray rock, which uncovers 2 feet, the Echaudes rocks, the highest head of which uncovers 81 feet, and a little ledge named Lello-Bras, the highest head of which is awash at the lowest springs. The sea is always high in the eddies of these rocks when it blows hard. When the beacon on the Men-Garo rock comes in one with the pyramid on the Quistillic rock haul more to the westward and bring the beacon on the Piliers rock in line with Lannevez mill, W. A S. This latter mark will lead into Brehat road, passing three-quarters of a cable to the south east of a small patch, named Basse de Men-Garo, on which there are about 26 feet, and a long cable to the north-west of another patch, called Ca'in-ar-Rat, on which there are 23 feet at half tide. The flood and ebb streams follow very nearly the direction of Brehat channel, and their velocity during springs varies from 3 to 5 knots, almost the whole time of their duration ; but north of the channel, from its entrance to abreast Roc'h-ar-Bel, the direction of the flood is more to the eastward and the ebb more to the westward. Abreast the Roc'h-ar- Bel the flood sets to the S.E. from 4 to 5 knots, and the ebb to the N.W. by N. at about the same rate, and that during a period of 4 hours. It follows therefore that a sailing vessel rounding the Roc'h-ar-Bel from the westward, with the wind from that direction, would not be able to fetch the entrance of the channel, but would run the risk of being carried on to the Horaine ledge ; and that leaving the channel with easterly winds during the ebb, she would not be able to weather the Roc'h-ar-Bel. Under these circumstances she should, in the former case, pass inshore of the Roc'h-ar-Bel through the Moisie or the Men-du-Castrec channels ; and on leaving Brehat channel, she should, when abreast the beacon on the Petit-Pen- Azen, steer to the westward with the Moisie rock (a large isolated rock lying 3^ cables to the S.E. by E. of the Sark rock, and which only covers at the highest springs) in one with the Heaux light house ; this mark will lead between the Sirlots ledge and the Men-du- Castrec ledge, into the Men-du-Castrec channel. Through Passage du Men-du-Castrec. \u2014 The entrance to this channel is about 2| miles to the S.E. by E. of the Heaux lighthouse, betw-een the Men-du-Castrec ledge and a small ledge named the Ar-Mesclck. The channel leads into the entrance of the Pontrieux river close to the east ward of the beacon on the Vieille, the most north-easterly of the rocks which extend in that direction from St. Mode isle (this isle may be seen from a distance of 7 or 8 miles ; it has a large white watch tower on it, ancl is steep on all sides). The tidal streams follow its direction, and their rate during springs is from 44; to 5 knots. The leading mark through is"], [414, "398 CAPE FREHEL TO LES HEAUX LIGHTHOUSE, [chap.vih the guard-house on Arcouest point kept on a S. by W. A W. bearing, when it will be seen in the middle of the space which separates the high rocks bordering both sides of Kerpont channel. The Men-du-Castrec channel at low water springs can only be navi gated with the aid of a pilot, as the leading mark passes close to an 8 feet patch, lying at the north-east extreme of the Ar-Mesclek ledge ; but from half flood to half ebb vessels of 14 feet draught can run through it without any risk. With the wind between N.N.W. and W.S.W., and even at low water, pilots take vessels through it that are bound to the ports in St. Brieuc bay, but they quit its direction when the Moisie rock is in one with the Heaux lighthouse ; they then steer with this latter mark on until they pick up the mark for Brehat channel. Through Passage de la Moisie. \u2014 This channel is very narrow but straight, and vessels of 14A feet draught can navigate it from half flood to half ebb. It lies between the Sark rocks and the Men-du-Castrec channel, and like the latter channel it leads to the entrance of Pontrieux river and of Kerpont and Brehat channels. The leading mark through is, the old mill, without sails and with a red roof, on Brehat isle, kept exactly between the western gable of St. Michel chapel and a stone cross near the chapel ; but these objects are too close together for a good mark, and the services of a pilot are indispensable. The flood stream runs 41 or 5 knots in this channel at the springs and nearly follows its direction as far as the beacon on a flat rock, named the Noguejou-bian, which uncovers 12*| feet ; but beyond this the stream inclines to the S.W. towards St. Mode isle. The strength of the ebb is rather less than the flood, and it takes more the direction of the channel as the tide falls. Through Le Kerpont This channel, which separates Brehat from Beniguet isle, also leads into Brehat road, but is only practicable for vessels of moderate draught after 4 hours flood, at the period the rate of that stream begins to slacken. The leading mark through is the same as that for the Men-du-Castrec channel, viz., the guard-house on Arcouest point bearing S. by W. A W., when it will be seen in the middle of the space which separates the high rocks bordering each side of the channel. Both these channels are practicable for vessels drawing 14A feet as long as the Vieille rock is covered, the least depth in the Kerpont at that time being 16A feet. This rock, which has a beacon on it, lies N. by E. \u00a3 E. about half a mile from the entrance, and uncovers 24 feet at the lowest tides. The Kerpont has two outlets to the southward ; one between the south west point of Brehat and the Noires ledge, (the south-cast rock of which, the Vis- Argent, has a beacon on it ancl uncovers 17 feet), and the other"], [415, "399 chap, viii ] BAIE DE ST.

APPROACHING RADE de BREHAT Irom EAST and S.E Brehat road can also be entered by passing between the dangers lying to the east ward of Brehat. These channels are not much frequented, as the streams cross them obliquely, but under certain circumstances vessels of large draught can run through them even at low water. The first channel to the eastward of Brehat channel is bounded to the north-west by the Horaine and the Echaudes ledges, and to the south-east by the Men-Marc'h ledge. The leading mark through is, the summit of a high rocky islet, named Menou, lying half a mile to the eastward of La Trinite point, in line with the north-east mill of Lande-Blanche bearing S.W. by W. Follow this direction until Ar couest mill is in one with a great forked rock lying close to the north west of Blanche de l'Arcouest isle, W. A S. ; this latter mark will lead up to La Rade beacon from whence a direct course can be steered for the road. To pass through the channel between the Men-Marc'h and the Ringue-bras ledges, keep the highest summit of St. Riom isle in one with the north-east mill of Lande-Blanche, W.S.W., until Arcouest mill is in line with the above great forked rock, W. A S., which will lead up to La Rade beacon. With a moderate wind, the Ringue-bras can be crossed at the neaps from half flood to half ebb, by keeping the north east mill of Lande-Blanche in line with the highest summit of St. Riom isle. The Sable banks can also be crossed under the same circumstances of wind and tide, by keeping Arcouest mill in line with the above great forked rock, W. A S. If wishing to pass to the southward of the Sable banks, which it will not be prudent to cross at low water springs, bring the pyramid on the Quistillic rock between the old mill and St. Michel chapel, on Brehat, N.W., and it will lead close to the southward of their south extreme, a short distance to the southward of the Basse Pomoriou, on which there are only 9 feet, and between the Ca'inar-Monse rock, which is awash, and a small patch named the Carec-Mingui, on which there are only 8 feet at low water. When Arcouest mill comes in one with the above great forked rock, W. A S., steer for La Rade beacon. To approach Brehat road from the south-east, bring the northern mill on Brehat in line with the pyramid on the Quistillic, N. by W.

In Brehat road, the direction of the flood stream at its commencement, or at 5 hours before high water, is S.W. by W. The greatest rate of this stream, 2 knots, is at 2\\ hours before high water when its direction is E.S.E. The ebb begins to run to the N.W. a few minutes after high water. Its greatest rate, 1^ knots, lasts from 3 to 4 hours after high water, when its direction varies from W.N.W. to W. by N. Winds from E.S.E. to S.S.E. cause a nasty sea in the road during the flood ; the holding ground, however, is good. The streams are not strong in Ferlas channel, which is a continuation of this road to the westward. The flood follows its direction as long as the banks are uncovered ; it then sets towards Arcouest point. At about 20 minutes before high water an eddy comes from Paimpol bay, and, after rounding Arcouest point, sets from it with some strength towards the south-east point of Brehat, and also crosses the eastern part of Ferlas channel towards Kerpont channel. Its rate decreases about the time of hi^h water, but it resumes its strength as soon as the ebb stream begins. The latter stream takes the direction of this eddy until the banks are uncovered, when it runs to the westward in the direction of the channel. riviere de pontrieux The northern entrance to this river is between the north-east part of the Roc'h-ar-Bel ledge and the northern part of the Horaine ledge. The river may also be approached from the eastward through Ferlas channel, which is comprised between the southern shore of Brehat and the main-land, and is practicable for vessels of large draught when in charge of local pilots from half flood to half ebb, but only coasters can use it at low water springs. Various anchorages in the entrance of this river afford refuge to vessels of the largest draught, but they are difficult of access on the ebb, when they should not be attempted, without a pilot. As the holding ground is bad and the streams rapid in the middle of the river, a berth should be taken as near as possible to the edge of the mud banks on either side. Pomelin road lies on the left bank of the river at about 6 miles within the entrance, and the marks for the best anchorage in it are, the guard house on Arcouest point in line with the beacon on the Moguedhier rock,"], [417, "CHAP. VIII.] BAIE DE ST. BRIEUC; RIVIERE DE PONTIEUX. 401 and the old mill on Brehat just open to the northward of the enclosure on Verte isle ; a vessel should moor here north and south. There is also anchorage to the north-east of this road, near the outer edge of the mud banks which uncover as far as the line on which the pyramid on the Croix rock is in one with Loguivi mill ; moor here W.N.W. and E.S.E. Another good and well sheltered anchorage, in which the streams have not much strength, is near the edge of the mud banks to the south-east of Bois isle. The anchoring ground extends in a N.E. and S.W. direction from the line on which the beacon on the Vieille de Loguivi rock is in line with Arcouest mill, to that on which the northern mill of Brehat is in one with the beacon on the Trou-blanc rock, moor here also W.N.W. and E.S.E. The first anchorage within the river for a vessel of large draught is on the right bank, to the North and N.W. of a large rock named Melus, which lies fronting the Douane or custom-house office on theRoc'h-ar- On. There is room for two frigates between the Bodie tower and the Sabot-du-Sud rock ; also excellent holding ground on both sides the river out of the strength of the streams to the southward of Cout-Mer cove and to the south-west of a water mill abreast the cove. The above tower is a large white pyramid erected half-way up the left bank of the river at about one mile to the south-east of Bois isle, and is one of the leading marks for the entrance. The port of Lezardrieux, situated on the left bank of the river, nearly 2\\ miles above the custom-house office on the Roc'h-ar-On, is full of rocks ancl dries out at all tides. Vessels of the smallest draught are neaped in it for 4 or 5 days ; but at its entrance, among the rocks, there is a bottom of soft mud, on which two or three coasters can lie without being neaped. Vessels can generally remain afloat in a small channel between this port and a rocky ledge in the middle of the river. Those bound up to Pontrieux also anchor here when they arrive at the neaps, or when at the springs they have to cross the difficult passages in the river, which cannot be done without the aid of a local pilot. The first of these passages, named Ar-Toul-Tane, is at a sudden turn the river takes at 4 cables to the southward of Lezardrieux suspension bridge, which is elevated 108 feet above the lowest tides. The second, passage is in the turn of the river under the high land and the chateau do la Roche- Jug ut. The little port of Pontrieux is on the right bank of the river, at about half a mile below the town and 8 miles ahove Lezardrieux bridge. The berths at the foot of the quay dry about 221 feet above the level of the lowest tides.

This mark will lead to the eastward of the Roc'h-ar-Bel. the Mer-du-Castrec, and the Sirlots ledges, and to the westward of the Horaine and the Echaudes ; on entering the river it will also lead to the eastward of the beacons on the Vieille de St. Mode, the Rodello, the Kerrannets, and the Moguedhier rocks, and to the westward of the beacons on the Petit-Pen-Azen, the Corderie, and the Freres rocks. The beacon on the Petit-Pen-Azen bears about N.E. A N., 4A cables from the north extreme of Brehat, and at a quarter of a mile to the north-west of it is a dangerous patch awash at low water springs. The Corderie beacon is on the summit of a dangerous rock which uncovers about 13 feet, and lies only three-quarters of a cable to the eastward ofthe fairway. The beacon on the Moguedhier is about IA cables to the N. b W. of the pyramid on the Croix. Having arrived at a position about 3 or 4 cables to the north-east of the latter pyramid, or before the vessel is abreast the beacon on the Moguedhier, haul a little to starboard, to pass a safe distance to the west ward of pyramid on the Croix ; when to the southward of this pyramid, pick the leading mark up again and pass to the westward of the beacons on the Trou-blanc and Vieille rocks.

Steer to the eastward to pass midway between the beacon on the Piliers, and that on the Vis- Argent rocks, and half a cable to the northward of the summits of the Rouray, the Conan, and Levret rocks, which latter border the south side of the channel, and never cover ; if a signal is made for a pilot when in their vicinity, the vessel will be boarded by fishermen, who will pilot her into the river to the southward of the Tranquet rock. There is a passage also to the eastward of the Tranquet and the beacon on the Trou-blanc, named Trou-blanc channel, and when the wind allows, it will be better to take this route than that to the southward of the Tranguet, which it is sometimes dangerous and even difficult to do at the springs.

The three channels leading to the entrance are named Pas de la Gaine, Grande Passe, and Passe du N.E. Passe de la Gaine, the most easterly of these channels, is practicable for vessels of about 14 feet draught after 3A hours flood, and will be found useful when bound into the river from the eastward, if there is sufficient wind to stem the tide. The entrance is comprised between the Heaux and Sark rocks, and the leading mark through is a large house, standing alone to the northward of Plougrescan, in line with the summit of Men-Noblance, bearing W.

By following this direction a vessel will pass nearly half a mile to the southward of the Heaux lighthouse and over Pont de la Gaine, which is a narrow cut in the ledge ex tending from the south end of the Duono rocks with only a foot water in it at the lowest tides. Grande Passe leads to the entrance of the river from the north-west, and is practicable for vessels of any draught. When entering by this channel, keep St. Antoine mill exactly in line with the mill of Port de-la-Chaine, S.S.E., southerly, and the vessel will pass about 3 cables to the eastward of the Renauds rocks, which never cover ; over a patch of 4 fathoms, which, with the leading mark on, is the least depth in this \u25a0channel at the lowest tides ; about a cable to the eastward of the Pierre a l'Anglais rock, which uncovers 8 feet ; and 2 cables to the westward of the beacon on the Corbeau rock, which uncovers 19 feet.

After passing between the beacons on the Taureau and Corne rocks (these rocks lie about IA miles within the en trance and between them the deep water channel is not more than three quarters of a cable wide), and to the southward of the Taureau bank, steer up the river, keeping midway between the rocks bordering its banks. tides. \u2014 It is high water, full and change, at the entrance of Treguier river at 5h. 22m. ; great springs rise about 35 feet, and neaps 21 feet.

The leading mark into this port is Comtesse mill in line with the centre of a little white sandy beach, situated close to the eastward of the Voleur rock, at the head of the port, S. |- E. A vessel will not have less than 22 feet at low water by anchoring to the north-west of a large rock, named the Louet, lying on the eastern side of the port. If she can take the ground, good beaching places will be found to the east and E.S.E. of the Voleur, where the bottom is 10A feet above the lowest tides. anse de perros, situated 4 miles to the westward of Port Blanc, affords good shelter from westerly winds to vessels that can take the ground. Those of light draught can lie afloat in the outer part of the bay, between which and the head of the bay, called the port, the beaching places are excellent, on a bottom of muddy sand elevated about 94; feet above the lowest tides. Vessels sometimes run into the port for shelter, but they risk being neaped. Tome, a narrow isle nearly a mile in length, lies a mile to the north-east of the western point of the bay, and its highest part is at about the third of the length of the isle from its north extreme. directions A vessel bound into Perros bay from the eastward, will pass to the north-west of the outer edge of the Four ledge by not going to the southward of the line on which the high steeple of Notre Dame de Clarte church is in one with the highest part of Tome isle, W.

To the westward of Primel point is Morlaix bay, at the head of which are the entrances to the rivers Morlaix and St. Pol-de-Leon. Within the entrance of the former river is Morlaix road, where there is anchorage for vessels of the largest draught. The entrance to Morlaix river is on the eastern side of Morlaix bay, but its navigation is too intricate to be attempted without a pilot. There are two channels leading into it, the eastern of which is named Chenal de Treguier, and the western Grand Chenal ; the former, although not so deep as the latter, is generally preferred by coasters as its width will admit of tacking. The position of the little port of Penpoull, on the western shore of the bay, is easily known by the two lofty spires of St. Pol-de-Leon cathedral, situated about half a mile to the westward of it. lights To enter Morlaix river at night, two lights, dioptric and of the fifth order, are exhibited, one from Noire islet, lying just within the entrance of the river at 4 cables to the south-east of the Chateau du Taureau isle, and the other from Lande tower, on the left bank of the river, aud when in line S.W. by S. they lead to the entrance. That on Noire isle is a fixed white light, varied every two minutes by a bright flash, preceded and followed by a short eclipse ; it is elevated 46 feet above high water level, and is visible from a distance of 10 miles. Lande tower exhibits, at an elevation of 285 feet above the same level, a fixed white light, visible at 12 miles.

Directly Lande tower is made out, steer to the south ward with it in line with the summit of Noire isle bearing S.W. by S., and it will lead to the westward of the Trepieds ledge, the highest rock on which uncovers 9 feet, to the eastward of the Pierre-Noire rock, and to the west ward of the beacons* on the Plate, the Petit-Aremen, and the Manou rocks, up to the entrance of the river. The Trepieds ledge lies at the south-west end of the Meloine ledge, and the marks for the highest rock on it are, the steeple of Plougaznou church in line with the Carrec-an-Ti rock, S. 4; E., and the two spires of St. Pol-de-Leon church, in one with the Bisayers rock, W. by S. The Pierre-Noire uncovers 6 feet, and is marked by an iron conical shaped buoy, surmounted with a weathercock, painted half white and half black perpendicularly. The beacon on the Plate is surmountedwith a ball, the eastern side of which is black and the western white.

There are three deep channels, named Chenal du Four, Chenal de la Helle, and Passage du Fromveur, lying between these dangers, but only the latter should be taken by a stranger on account of the sunken rocks, lying nearly in the fairway of the two former, and also of the tidal streams, which, at the springs, run 44; knots, the flood setting to the northward.* Chenal du Four. \u2014 The northern entrance to this channel is about 3 miles to the W.N.W. of the Four rock, and the leading mark through is, the lighthouse on Kermorvan point in line with that on St. Mathieu point, bearing South a little westerly. When within half a mile of the former point the vessel should be hauled out a little, to pass to the westward of the point between the Petite and Grande Vinotiere rocks ; from thence the navigation of the southern part of the channel becomes more difficult, on account of the Renards and Chenal patches and the Vieux Moines and BoRsemen Or rocks.
