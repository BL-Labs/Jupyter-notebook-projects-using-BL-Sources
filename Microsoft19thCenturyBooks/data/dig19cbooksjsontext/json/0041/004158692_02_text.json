Encourages by the kind reception bestowed on the first volume, and the flattering commendations of the Lord Chancellor, the Masters of the Rolls of Ireland and England, and other high judicial and official personages, I have, in this volume, concluded the Calendar of the Patent Rolls to the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. The limits of an introduc tion necessarily forbid a detailed notice of our voluminous Anglo-Irish records; and in the preface to the first volume of this work, I was prohibited from more than hastily advert ing to the inexhaustible stores of information they afford to the historian and the legal inquirer, and the valuable evidences they contain illustrative of the period they embrace. But it became essential, in limine, to invite public attention to those important, but comparatively unknown, materials for our early history, and to give a succinct r.sume of the Rolls and Records of which the work purports to be a Calendar. To this hasty narrative my limits reluctantly confined me ; to have entered more into detail would have, perhaps, com plicated that which it was my intention to elucidate; and I reserved to myself the right of again referring to a subject interesting, I trust, to the scholar and the antiquary, and to which reference has been so seldom made. In the first place, it must not be supposed, that the Patent and Close Rolls contain all the records transmitted for preserva tion and enrolment to Chancery during the period those Rolls embrace ; on the contrary, they contain a very small portion of those invaluable documents. From the beginning of the reign of Henry the Eighth to the end of the reign of Elizabeth, 6,625 Royal Fiats, or Warrants, reached the Rolls Office for enrol ment and preservation. Very few of those were then, or at a -1"], [12, "PREFACE. IV all, as they should have been, copied on the Roll; and they remain to this day uncalendared, and to the public almost wholly unknown, a monument of the indisposition which has hitherto prevailed to bring to modern light the contents of our precious archives. I trust the time will arrive when a favourable opportunity and other propitious circumstances will enable me to unfold their invaluable contents to the public, and remove the reproach arising from their com parative oblivion. In England, about the middle of the fifteenth century, grants from the crown of offices and lands were frequently ante-dated, to the prejudice of the King and the people; therefore, by the Statute of the 18\u00b0 Henry VI., c. 1, it was provided, that in future the King's warrant (in Ireland called a \"Fiat\") for every grant should be entered of record in Chancery the day of its delivery to the Chancellor, and that the letters patent for such grant, when prepared by the Chancellor, pursuant to the fiat, should bear date the day of the delivery of the warrant into Chancery, and not sooner. This Statute was re-enacted in Ireland in 37\u00b0 Henry VI. Those Fiats were signed by the Monarch or the Lord Deputy, generally transmitted from England to this country, and in tended, as I have before remarked, for enrolment and preser vation: they comprise, inter alia \u2014 Commissions for dividino counties into ploughlands ; for dividing lands in Connaught and Thomond ; lands in the Analv : the lands of the White Knight, and the country called Lecale; to collect stores; to transport goods into England; to execute martial law in Lambay and various counties ; to levy the forces ; to invade O'Hanlon's Country; to impress bakers; to escort the Earl of Kildare to the Queen; to inquire concerning black rents; to impress seamen ; for ecclesiastical government ; protection for Gerald, Earl of Desmond, to meet the Earl of Essex \u2022 to export wheat ; to punish the O'Connors ; to execute martial law ; to quell the rebellion of Rory Oge ; to lead the expedi tion into Munster ; to array the forces ; to import wine \u2022 to inquire into ecclesiastical matters; to compound with the lords of the province of Connaught ; to treat with the rebels \u2022"], [13, "PREFACE.

Of these, with the exception of one membrane, containing the exemplification of three statutes enacted at York, in the 3rd of Edward III., all the Statute Rolls of Ireland are missing down to the 5th of Henry VI. Of the reign of Henry VII. there are but three Statute Rolls, viz., for the 8th, 10th, and 24th years ; but four, viz., of the 7\u00b0, 25\u00b0, 28\u00b0, and 33\u00b0, of Henry VHI. Of Philip and Mary, but one Statute Roll, viz., of the 3rd and 4th ; of Eliz abeth, but three, viz., of the 7th, 11th, 27th, 28th ; of James I., but one Statute Roll, viz., of the 6th of his reign ; of Charles I., but five, viz., one of the 10th and 16th, and three of the 15th year of his reign ; of Charles II., but seven, from the 13th to the 18th of that reign. But this is accounted for, as no Parliament assembled in Ireland after the year 1666 until the fourth of William and Mary, of which year there remains only one Statute Roll; of William, only four, viz., one of the 7th and three of the 9th year ; after which the Statute.Rolls are in regular series. Of Edward I. but three Patent Rolls are extant, viz., one of the 1st and two of the 31st of the reign; that is, the rolls of thirty -two years are missing. Of Edward II. the Patent Rolls are missing of the 1st, 6th, 7th, 8th, 12th, 15th, 16th, 17th, and 19th years of the reign. Of Edward III. the Patent Rolls are missing for the first seven years of the reign; also of the 10th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th; from the 21st to the 25th, both inclusive; of the 27th, 28th, and 31st; all the rolls from the 34th to the 41st, both inclusive ; also of the 43rd, 44th, 45th, 47th, and 50th ; in all thirty-four years, are missing of this reign. Of Richard II. there is no Patent Roll extant of the 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, Hth"], [15, "PREFACE. VII 1 4th, and 17th years, nor any of the last four years of the reign; in all eleven years. Of Henry VI. the Patent Rolls are missing of the 6th, 7th, 8th, from the 15th to the 24th, both inclusive; the 26th, 27th; in all for seventeen years. Of Edward IV., who reigned twenty-three years, there are extant Patent Rolls of the 1st, 7th, 15th 16th, 21st, 22nd only. Of Henry VII., who reigned twenty-three years, the Patent Rolls for the first nine years are missing; also for the 11th, 12th, 13th, 16th, 18th, 19th, 20th, 22nd, 23rd, in all for eighteen years ; more than three-fourths of the reign. Of Henry VIII., who reigned thirty-seven years, the Patent Rolls for twenty years are missing, viz., for the first four years, for fifteen years between the sixth and twenty-second of the reign, and also for the twenty-sixth year. After this, the Patent Rolls are preserved in almost a regular series, with the following exceptions : of the reign of Elizabeth there is no Patent Roll of the fifteenth year; of Charles I., the third part of the Roll for the tenth year, 1635, has been lost or mislaid for many years. From 1644 to 1655 there is a chasm very obviously accounted for. Cromwell's Rolls commence in 1655, from which time, or from the restoration, with the exception of a portion of the reign of James H., the Patent Rolls are preserved in a regular series. The history of Ireland since the reign of Henry II. is com paratively unknown, and it will so remain until the Anglo-Nor man, or legal records of Dublin, and the State Papers of Lon don, shall be combined with the annals in our possession. Such of the native writers as were versed in the latter were denied all access to the public records, and the privileged English were unacquainted with the Irish accounts. It is well known, that from the time of the dissolution of the monasteries to the end of the- seventeenth century nume rous records were carried out of Ireland by ecclesiastics and other Irish exiles to various parts of Europe. Amongst those were some of the most ancient and valuable relating to the country. These facts were represented in the year 1822 to the Commissioners of Records, and it was suggested that"], [16, "VIII PREFACE. inquiry should be made through the office of Secretary for Foreign Affairs, to the different Courts of Europe, who might give instructions to have transmitted catalogues of such docu ments as might be found in their possession. A statementO) was prepared with reference to the several places in Europe, from Denmark to Spain, where inquiry ought to be made ; yet nothing further was done on the subject. But the principal occasion of the disappearance of the records is not without its consolation, for it affords hope that all whose disappearance is regretted are not irrecoverably lost ; it is this (and Prynne, in his preface to Cotton's Tower Records, has some curious observations on a similar practice, which from time to time prevailed to a great extent, even in England), it was not unusual for a Roll or record to be sent for to the private house of the Master or principal Keeper of Records, where it but too often remained. It is very well known that in the private muniment-room of the late Lord Hertford \" certain records of Chancery\" were preserved. Similar discoveries might be made in the muniment-rooms of the other great families who have held office, particulars in that of the Marquis of Ormond, where are still to be seen the records of the County Palatine, and the collections of the monastic chartularies, previous to the dissolution of the abbeys, priceless manuscripts, the archives of Jerpoint, Athassel, Dunbrody, Innistiogue, Kells, and Holy Cross. In Armagh, records and visitations have been traced to the record-room there, but for some unintelligible reason the librarian on his appointment is bound by oath to exclude every one of the public from those valuable documents. Again and again have I, professionally, sought access to the records in this department ; and once, only, under threat of a \" duces tecum,\" I was suffered to take extracts from an original visita tion of an Irish diocese in the reign of James I. A Recoo- nizance Roll of the reign of Elizabeth was bought some time ago at a tradesman's sale.

IX the original of Vallancey's Green Book, compiled by authority of the late Irish Record Commissioners, is now in my library ; and a few short years since a Plea Roll of our Irish Courts of Justice was found derelict in an old castle on the banks of the Rhine. After curious and strange vicissitudes it was ulti mately brought to the hammer, and secured by the patriotic munificence of Sir Bernard Burke. In an old book of reference of the date of Charles I., pre served in the Rolls Office, it is stated that a Parliament. Roll of the 13\u00b0 of Edward the Third, was in the Lord Primate's hands. This Roll is not now to be found. From this we may presume that other records have been abstracted. We read in Archbishop Usher's treatise of the first establishment of English laws and Parliaments in Ireland, that \" the Acts of the Parliament holden at Kilkenny, the first Thursday in Lent, 40\u00b0 Edward III., are to be found among the Rolls of Chancery, and are commonly known as the ' Statutes of Kilkenny.'\" Amongst the numerous records lost by time and accident the latter statutes have also disappeared, for the oldest Statute Roll now to be found is one of the 5th of Henry VI., a.d. 1426 ; and Bishop Nicholson, in his \" His torical Library,\" states \u2014 \"That this Statute has long been lost out of the Parliamentary records of the kingdom.\" Plowden states that in his time it was \"preserved in the Castle of Dublin ;\" but it is not now to be found amongst the records of that depository. Serjeant Mayart states that \" many of the ancient records of Ireland, in troublesome times, were transmitted to Eng land, and those which remain in Ireland were put together in one place in times of rebellion, and after taken out by the officers of the several courts, but not duly sorted.\". ) Thus we know that numerous records relating to Ireland are now to be found in various repositories in London, where they are totally useless. I myself discovered there an interesting and valuable collection of Irish MSS. stowed away in sacks, labelled \" Baga Hiberni\u00e6,\" the contents of which were pre viously, I believe, unknown. I there found the original (\u00bb) Part II., page 81."], [18, "X PREFACE. treaties of peace with the Irish chieftains, \"the corres pondence out of Ireland,\" and, amongst other interesting original letters, one from \" Silken Thomas,\" whilst a prisoner in the Tower, directed to his servant, Brian, entreating him in the most earnest terms \"to procure him some pecuniary assistance, as he was without shoes or hosen, living on the bounty of his fellow-prisoners.\" Those records, though useless in London, would prove useful at home, if only for historical purposes ; and, as they belong to Ireland, they ought to be restored. Sir George Carew has been charged with having taken away and destroyed some of the ancient Irish records, and his collection in the Lambeth Library is thus described by Nicholson: \u2014 \" This great noble man wrote other books besides the 'Pacata Hibernia,' relat ing to the affairs of Ireland, forty-two volumes whereof are in the Archbishop's library at Lambeth.\". ) \" Really it is reserved for the present age to look back with reverence and interest to the monuments and records of our ancestors; and the more remote those monuments are, the greater is our anxiety to know something of them. We desire, with laudable curiosity, to learn the habits and customs, laws and usages of bygone ages, and for the first time, for cen turies, we have become animated with a desire to rescue from unmerited oblivion or from imminent decay and destruction, the mouldering monuments of a remote age. In England, France, and over the continent of Europe, the labours of the antiquary are directed with zeal and diligence to elucidate the early condition of his country, and rewarded with the approbation and encouragement of a people capable of appre ciating this interesting department of knowledge. \" It is to our early laws and statutes, to registers, chartu laries, rentals and rolls, under their legion of technical appel lations, that we must mainly have recourse, if we would gain the moderate credit of knowing at least as much about our own forefathers as about the populace that thronged the streets of Athens or Rome. It is a fact that the great majority of the educated classes of this country possess a better (\u00bb) \" Irish Historical Library,\" ch. ii."], [19, "PREFACE. XI acquaintance with life and manners in Greece and Italy, two thousand years ago, than with the habits and usages of their own forefathers, only removed from them by the compara tively short period that has elapsed since the invention of the press.\". ) At length, after ages of neglect, thanks alike to the public spirit and munificence of the Government and the discern ment of the Master of the Rolls, the ancient literature of Ireland seems destined to emerge from obscurity. Those me morials, which have hitherto lain so long unexplored, now appear to awaken the attention of the learned and the curiosity of the public ; and the literary remains of a people once dis tinguished in the annals of learning may be rescued from the oblivion to which they have been so undeservedly consigned. That the ancient Irish possessed ample stores in their native language, capable of captivating the fancy and enlarging the understanding, is well known to those acquainted with the mouldering membranes which have survived to our times. The historical importance of our annals has been acknow ledged by the learned men of Europe for the last three cen turies. They are written in the language of the first inhabit ants of Europe, and with a simplicity of detail which truth only can confer ; they record the primeval state of the island, the origin of its early inhabitants, their history, religion, laws, and the arts known amongst them for several generations. Hitherto the difficulty of getting access to our national archives, and the still greater difficulty of deciphering them when procured, may be alleged as an excuse for the indolence and imperfections of which we have reason to complain in the generality of historical writers. The records and historic narratives upon which we have to rely for illustrating any particular period in our history, ap pear to have undergone, as I have observed, even at a remote time, a wide dispersion, and to have been broken into almost innumerable fragments. We have examples of the manner in which materials for our history are scattered abroad in the (\u00bb) Riley's \" Munimenta Gildhall\u00e6 Londoniensis.\""], [20, "XII PREFACE. MSS. in the Burgundian Library and the College of Saint Isidore. In the latter are twenty volumes of Irish MSS., some of them of the greatest interest and value, relating the ancient civil and ecclesiastical history of Ireland, and all of more or less importance in other respects. The late Dean Lyons sent over tracings in pencil of the chief heads of sub jects in the collection, which tracings are now in the Irish Academy. A sum of \u00a3400 was offered for those interest ing memorials, with what result I know not. Application was made a few years since to the King of the Belgians, for a loan of some of the Irish manuscripts in the Burgundian Library, and his Majesty at once consented to permit any one or more of the manuscripts to be sent over to this country through the Belgian Ambassador in London and the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland ; accordingly, in 1849, two volumes were sent, containing the Martyrologies of Aengus the Culdee, of Tallaght, of Marianus Gorman, and of Donegal. On returning those MSS. to Brussels, two other valuable volumes \u2014 the Danish Wars and a volume of Historical Poems \u2014 were kindly lent; and in the year 1856, the remaining volumes of the collection were sent over for the purposes of the Brehon Law Commission ; but none in this country could be found sufficiently patriotic to defray the expense of copy ing them, although amongst them are to be found some of the most interesting memorials of a very remote age. As my learned friend Dr. Reeves observes, \" The most important contribution ever made to the literature of the Irish language was the work of a man who never set foot on the Irish soil. A foreigner, every way alive to the genius and manners of the people of this country as thev now are, found, in Helvetia and other parts of the Continent, monuments of the Irish as they were a thousand years ago \u25a0 and with a magic hand, re-constructed their ancient lan guage \u2014 reviving lost usages, exposing corruptions of modern growth, and handing over to the chief surviving representa tive of this great Celtic family a rationale of their tongue, as astonishing as it was unexpected. \" To Zeuss belongs the honour of having exhumed and"], [21, "PREFACE. XIII printed the oldest known specimens of our language. It is true that he was indebted for this in some measure to his favourable situation for visiting the monasteries of Austria and of Switzerland, and the Library of Milan, where those treasures are preserved ; but for his masterly interpretation of them, and the splendid system of critical and philosophical grammar which he has built of those materials, we have only to thank his own great science and patience. The unique, philological training of Germany could alone provide such a work.. ) If we except the Book of Armagh, we have, in Ireland, no manuscript containing vernacular matter of a date anterior to 1100. The Liber Hymnorum, the Leabhar-iiah-Uidhre, the Book of Leinster, the Book of M'Et/a/i, the Books of Bally mote and Lecan, are the chief and earliest repositories of our native literature. No doubt they contain compositions which lay claim \"to great antiquity \u2014 the \" Amhra of Columcile,\" the \"Hymn of Fiech,\" the \"Vision of Adamnan;\" and the \" Ferlire of \u00c6ngus,\" profess to range from the sixth to the ninth centuries ; and the best authorities pronounce them to be of considerable antiquity, even in their present form. But the philologist can detect in them either the modernizing hands of successive copyists, or the incurable corruption of ignorant transcribers. The laro-est collection of Irish manuscripts scattered over the Continent, which are of the highest interest as objects of literature and art, is to be found in Switzerland, and especially in the Abbey of St. Gall. In the catalogue of the Library, the following books are recorded with others, written in the Irish character: \u2014 \" Epistol\u00e6 Pauli,\" \"Actus Apostolorum,\" \"Trac tatusBed\u00e6,\" \"Ezechiel Propheta,\" \"Metrum Sedulii,\" \"Vita S.

A second MS. of Columba's life is pre served in the British Museum ; a third in Marsh's Library, DubHn; a fourth in the Burgundian Library, at Brussels; another in Vienna, another in Windberg, and another in the library of the Cathedral at Admort, in Styria.

There is preserved an ancient copy of the Felire Aengusa, the Martyrology of Aengus, Gtile De, who composed, as Dr. O'Curry tells us, the original of this extraordinary work partly at Tallaght, in the county of Dublin, and partly at Cluain Eidhnech, in the Queen's County ; the \" Festology of Cathal M'Guire,\" a copy or fragment of the \" Liber Hymnorum,\" and several important MSS. relating to Irish history, copies of which cannot be elsewhere found.

An inestim able Irish ritual was discovered on the Continent by John Grace, of Nenagh, which was supposed to have belonged to the Irish monastery of Ratisbon, and that it had been sent thither in 1130 by Turlogh O'Brien; it was the gem of the Stowe collection, and has now passed into Lord Ashburn- (a) O'Cuny."], [24, "PREFACE.

He considered he had thus restored them to Ire land, but the boon has hitherto proved fruitless. These venerable national documents have been transferred \"from the gloom of the convent to the tomb of the Capulets.\" They slumber undisturbed on the shelves of our College. Need I speak of the records, the Down Survey and the Book of Lecan, which were carried to France by James II. ; the latter found its way into the Irish College, where it re mained until the year 1787, when it was restored by Dr. Kelly, President of the College, and deposited in the library of the Irish Academy. The Book of Ballimote, also said to have been brought from Paris, was presented to the same library. It was purchased in 1552 by Hugh O'Donnell from M'Donnogh, of Corran, for 140 milch cows. The Deputy- Keeper of the Rolls some time since applied to the proper authorities for the restoration of the Down Survey, with the intention of depositing it amongst our records, but without success. There is hardly a collection of manuscripts on the covers of which there may not be discovered fragments of Irish writ ings ; and these might, on examination, still afford many valu able contributions both to the history and ancient language of Ireland. How many of our ancient writings, in common with numerous productions of classic Rome, have been converted into palimpsests? It happened, of course, that the most voluminous authors were the greatest sufferers; these being naturally preferred as furnishing tlie most abundant mate rials.

His research would be amply repaid by countless monuments of the piety and devotion of our primitive Christian forefathers which he would find, unnoticed and neglected, in Switzerland, France, and Belgium ; for it is stated that almost every Continental library of importance possesses memorials of Irish missiona ries : and annotations in the vernacular, racy of the soil, have been found, copiously illustrating many a doubtful text, adorned with fanciful illuminations and figures, equipped in the appropriate costume of the country, leaving little doubt of the national characteristics or identity of the artist. To possess an easy mode of reference to the archives of a kingdom, which the public records are, must always be of an importance, only second to that of keeping the archives them selves secure. Yet, strange to say, it was not until the begin ning of the present century that the Government became aware of the necessity of doing the one or the other. The carelessness which has always been exhibited in regard to the custody of the public records, is a matter of universal com plaint: the hostile inroads of the Irish on the English of the Pale, as well as accidental fires, contributed to destroy a con siderable portion of our most valuable and interesting records. So great was the loss from these causes, that in the reign of Henry VII. it was found necessary to pass an Act by the Parliament of the Pale, to confirm the rights to propertj' of which the records had been accidentally or wilfully destroyed. But how little now-a-days is known of this well-remem bered Pale, so often mentioned in these volumes; of this once remarkable portion of Ireland, to which, for centuries, the English rule and government were confined, outside which the English law did not prevail, but the Brehon law was administered with impunity ; and of the conflicts of its inhabitants with \" the mere Irish ;\" of its triumphs, and final absorption by the gradual reduction of the country ! It was a name applied to those settlements within which the English laws and authority prevailed ; and the designation appears to have been adopted for the first time about the beginning of the thirteenth century. b"], [26, "XVIII PREFACE. The district was originally called the \" English lande,\" comprehending the counties of Meath, Louth, Dublin, and Kildare, to distinguish it from the surrounding territories which were possessed by the \" mere Irish.\" Campion tells us, \" An old distinction there is of Ireland into Irish and English Pales, for when the Irish had raised continual tumults against the English planted here with the Conquest, at last they coursed them into a narrow circuit of certain shires inLeinster, which the English did choose as the fattest soil, most defen sible, their proper right, and most open to receive help from England ; hereupon it was termed the Pale, as whereout they durst not peep ; but now both within this Pale uncivil Irish and some rebels do dwell, and without it contries and cities English are well governed.\" The laws and customs which from time immemorial had prevailed amongst the Irish, were, as might have been expected, entirely ignored by the settlers in the Pale, who brought with them their own system of jurisprudence. Though at first content to confine to themselves the operation of their own political system, the English, according as the sphere of their domain was extended in the island, endea voured to introduce, to the extinction of all others, the laws and usages which alone they recognised. Nor was this policy surprising, although in some respects its success was unexam pled. The conquest was a progressive one : no great blow was struck which, in the lapse of a century or two, might be forgotten. For four hundred years a series of petty wars prevailed, by which the natives were despoiled, and each special feature by which they were characterized was in turn extinguished. Thus were the settlers enabled completely to extinguish the laws and customs of the natives. The Brehon laws and other Irish customs dividing the people into different septs or clans, composed of people possessing the same sirname the laws governing the tenure of land and regulating the administration of justice, all gradually disappeared ; nor have they, under any form, been ever amalgamated with the pre sent system of jurisprudence. The different feelings with which the native Irish were re-"], [27, "PREFACE. XIX garded by the descendants of the first settlers, aud the fresh levies which, year after year, poured over from England, are fully shown by the records of contemporaneous history. The descendants of the original colonists, the De Burgos and the Geraldines, by intercourse and intermarriage with the Irish, learned to regard them with friendly eyes, and became, in the language of the adventurers, more Irish than the Irish them selves. This tended to engender that animosity from genera tion to generation which for a long period insured the dis traction of the country. The history of the Anglo-Irish under circumstances such as these may be readily conjectured. The Viceroys of Ire land at that period differed from their successors of the present day. They were principally able and experienced generals, whose martial ardour and enterprise were still fur ther whetted by the prospect of receiving large grants out of the territorial possessions from which they would succeed in ejecting the Irish occupants. There can be little doubt but that the English rule for many centuries in Ireland was confined to the Pale ; and Baily ob serves that it was \" that part wherein the English formerly lived apart from the Irish.\" From its institution the defence and preservation of its marches or borders have been objects of paramount importance to the English in Ireland. The earliest notice I find of the Pale is in the Black Book of Christ Church, Dublin, where are recorded the proceedings of a Par liament or Convention held by Sir John Wogan, Lord Justice, in 1295, where we find the following act or ordinance: \u2014 \" Certain magnates and others who have lands in the Marches near the Irish, and other possessions in the land of peace, absent themselves, and stay away in their manors in the land of peace, leaving their lands in the Marches waste, uncultivated, and unprotected ; and the Irish marauders, pass in o- through the midst of the waste lands in the Marches, un interruptedly cross over to perpetrate robberies, homicides, and other evils, upon the English, and return without arrest, annoyance, or impediment; wherefore, very many of the Marches are either wholly destroyed, or are, for the most h 2"], [28, "XX PREFACE. part, ruined ; and the English inhabitants either obey those marauders, or are driven into exile; it is, therefore, deter mined, that all such tenants, of whatever rank or condition, shall place guards on their lands in the Marches according to the quantity of their lands, that marauders shall not pass through those lands unpunished, or with impunity.\" (a) In the year 1278 the Irish inhabitants of the Pale made an application to De Ufford, the Chief Governor, accompanied with a conditional offer of 8,000 marks to the king, demand ing a grant of the free enjoyment of the laws of England. Edward, in his answer, acceded to this proposal, provided it would meet with the general assent of the commons, prelates, and nobles of the Pale ; and provided also the Irish would send him a body of good and stout foot soldiers, for one occasion, upon the first summons. Whether Edward was sincere and in ear nest about this boon, or utterly careless about it, or had already received an intimation that the project was impossible or inex pedient at this juncture, does not seem clear. It is likely the measure sought for, so beneficial to both England and Ireland, was too high to be attained by the royal will and power alone without the concert of the parliament and people of England. It is asserted, and is probable, that this measure was fatally counteracted by those who should have been foremost in the prosecution of it. Two years after, the same application was clamourously renewed ; the king, still requiring a condition which he knew to be impossible, namely, the free consent of the lords, prelates, and commons of the Pale, ordered a meeting of them to be held, notwithstanding the absence or minority of the members above-mentioned. However, no such measure was subsequently put in force, even if it were en acted ; as the charters of denization granted to the natives remaining on the rolls abundantly testify. Even in the centre of the Pale, the power and authority of the English had much diminished in Ireland. In the reio_ 0f Edward III. the estates of the Archbishop of Dublin were such that he was probably the richest prelate in the British Isles; but in that of Edward IV., the records teem with repre- (\u00bb) Translated from the oricrinal."], [29, "PREFACE.

In the year 1422, James of Desmond brought five thousand horse and foot (as stated in the King's Commission), out of Munster against O'Connor and Bermingham, who, with their forces, were ravaging the Pale, in consideration of which he was afterwards recognised as Earl, which title he had assumed on the occasion of the flight of Earl Thomas, his nephew, who was expelled from his estates, and \" made to surrender the Earldom,\" for having married the beautiful Catherine M'Coi mick, daughter of one of his tenants at the Abbey of Feale. In the reign of Edward III. there were nine Irish pala tinates: Carlow, Wexford, Kilkenny, Kildare, Leix (the portion of the five coheiresses of the family of the Earl Marshal), Meath, Ulster, Desmond, and Ormond. The abso lute lords of these palatines, says Sir John Davis, \" made barons and knights, exercised high justice in all points within their territories, erected courts for civil and criminal causes, for their own revenues, in the same form in which the king's courts were established at Dublin; they constituted their own judges, seneschals, sheriffs, coroners, and eschaetors.\" The king's writ did not run in those counties, which com prised at least two-thirds of the English colony, but ran only in the church lands, called the Crosses, wherein the sheriff was nominated by the king. Desmond held a parliament at Kil kenny at the very time the Lord Lieutenant convened another at Dublin ; and, subsequently, when De Ufford, intrusted with the administration, summoned Desmond to attend a parliament at Kilkenny, he treated the summons with contempt, and called one of his own at Callan, upon which the Lord Deputy pro claimed it treason to attend such unlawful assembly. In a discourse entitled \" Fandarus sice salus populi,\" in the reio-n of Edward III., no less than sixty regions of various dimensions are enumerated, governed by Irish chieftains, after their ancient laws and customs, with a catalogue of a barbarized alien English. The Pale is described as confined"], [30, "PREFACE.

On the Memoranda Roll of the Exchequer of the twenty fifth and twenty-sixth years of the reign of Edward III. is the following ordinance : \u2014 \" It is ordained that all those who have lands in the Marches and are resident in the land of peace, shall make their residence in their lands in the Marches, or shall put other sufficient persons in their place, in maintenance and aid of the Marches ; and whosoever do not do so, their lands, shall be taken by the king's ministers, and expended on the March, for the safeguard thereof, according to the quantity of the land.\" On the 25th August, 1464, the king, by letters patent, granted to the Earl of Desmond an annuity chargeable on the principal seignories belonging to the Crown \u25a0within the Pale, and the grant was confirmed by parliaments8) In the year 1364, the King's Bench and its records were removed to Dublin,. ) and it appears by the Close Roll 1\u00b0 Richard II., 1377, that the officers of the Exchequer, peti tioned the Duke of Clarence, in the Parliament of Kilkenny, that the Exchequer should be removed from Carlow, where it was in danger from Irish enemies and rebels, to Dublin.

In the 11th year of Henry IV. a parliament was assembled by Thomas of Lancaster ; and several summonses existing on our rolls establish the fact of a representation extending beyond the limits of the Pale. Lord Furnival, the King's Lieutenant, in the time of Henry V., made a martial circuit or journey round the marches and borders of the Pale, and brought the Irish to the King's peace, beginning with the Birnes, Tooles, and Cavanaghs on the south, and so passing to the Moore.

The grant extended to ecclesiastical persons, and to the tenants of ecclesiastical lands. Summoning his suffragans, Kelly, the Archbishop of Cashel, forbade, on pain of deprivation to his clergy aud of excommunication to the laity, the payment of this tax. The children of such as disobeyed were to be disqualified from ecclesiastical prefer ment, to the third generation, and he extended the sentence of excommunica tion to those who imposed, collected or contributed to this exaction.

His father having been almost totally occupied by continental conquest, paid but little attention to the melancholy representations of the Irish Parliament; and leaving his son, a minor, the guardian of the realm, had too much elsewhere to occupy his attention; Irish affairs were, therefore, almost totally neglected. Many powerful and influential nobles residing in the Irish country had adopted their language and manners; and being Eng lish rebels, or Irish enemies, ceased to attend the Councils of the Pale, the Commons being confined to the representa tives of the five or six counties then constituting the limits of the Pale, and a few cities and towns. Those out of the Pale were often fined for not returning the writs. On the Close Roll of the 14\u00b0 Henry VI., is a representation us the state of the country, made by the Archbishops of Ar magh and Dublin, and others, wherein they state, \" That it please your sovereigne lorde graciously consider how this lande of Ireland is welnigh destrued, and inhabyted with his enimys and rebelse, in so much that there is not left in the nether parties of the countees of Dyvelin, Mith, Louth, and Kildare, that goynyn to gadyr, oute of the subjection of the rebelse and enemys, scarisly xxx miles in lengthe and xx miles in brede there, as a man may surelie ride other go, in the said counties, to answere to the kyng's writs and com mandments.\" After the death of Henry VI., (says an old chronicle) when the wars between the houses were in their heat, \"almost all the good English blood which was left in Ireland was spent in these civil dissensions : so as the Irish became victorious over all without blood or sweat!'

Out of that little precinct no lords, knights, or burgesses, were summoned to Parliament ; neither did the king's writ run in any other part of the king dom ; and yet, upon the marches and borders, which at that time were grown so large as they took up half Dublin, half Meath, and a third part of Kildare and Louth, there was no law in use but the March law, which, in the Statutes of Kil kenny, is said to be no law, but a \" leud custome.\" Sir Edward Poynings, taking the best course he could to establish what he calls a commonwealth in Ireland, summoned the famous Parliament of Kilkenny ; but the vigorous laws there established did not spread their virtue beyond the Pale, though they were intended generally for the whole kingdom ; for the provinces without the Pale , which during the war of York and Lancaster, had wholly cast off the English Government, were not apt to receive the \"Statute of reformation,\" because \" they were not first broken and mastered again by the sword ;\" besides the Irish countries, which contained two-third parts of the kingdom, were not reduced to shire ground, so that in them the laws of England could not be possibly put in execution. Therefore, says Sir John Davies \u2014 \"Those good laws and pro visions were like good lessons set for the lute that is broke and out of tune, of which lessons little can be made, till the lute be made fit to be played upon.\" In some parts of the country the law of England was alto gether superseded ; and the civil code substituted ; and that law was administered by the Mayor of Galway, in the name of God, so completely had the English power been enfeebled or set aside. In the 17th year of King Edward IV., Jermyn Lynch, goldsmith, complained to Parliament that he had been sued by Walter White, of Limerick, merchant, and Garrett Lewes, \" before the Sovereign and Portrieves of Galway, by the civil law, and that on judgment they got possession of his premises in the town of Galway ;\" whereupon as there was no Sheriff in the counties of Limerick or Connaught, nor any lettered man bi/ which the law could be duly executed, William"], [35, "PREFACE.

It consisted of thirteen persons of the highest con sequence in the four counties of Kildare, Dublin, Meath, and Uriel (Louth) \u2014 the Lords Kildare and Portlester, and Sir Rowland Eustace, for the first; Lord Houth, Sir Robert Dowdal, and the Mayor of Dublin, for the second; Lord Gormanstown, Edward and Alexander Plunket, with Bar naby Barnewale, for the third ; Sir Laurence Taaffe, Richard Bellew, and the Mayor of Drogheda, for the last. The knights were to assemble on St. George's Day, to express their devotion to the English rule. Their captain was to be chosen annually, and was to have a train of 200 armed men, namely, 120 archers on horseback, and 40 other horsemen, with one attendant upon each. The archers were to receive 6a. . a day ; the others, for themselves and their attendants, each five pence, with an annual stipend of four marks. Thus was the Pale defended by 200 men, 13 officers, with such levies as might be raised on a sudden emergency. To support this troop, the fraternity were empowered to demand twelve pence in the pound out of all merchandize sold in Ireland, except hides, and the goods of Dublin and Drogheda freemen.

As an illustration of the habits and customs prevailing amongst the aristocracy and gentry of the Pale, and to show the studies and mode of education of the members of the bar in the reign of Edward IV., the following curious proceeding has been taken from theMemoranda Roll of the 9\u00b0Henry VIII. \" I, Thomas Netterville, the kynge's attorne, was with Sir Willym Darcy, of Plattene, on Mondy next before the feast of the Nativity, 9\u00b0 Henry VIII., 1517, and ther, among othyr cowyunts, inquired of hym whether he knew John Berming- ham and Nicholas Tryvers or not, and what age or stature the said Nicholas was of; the which Sir William shewed me, that he and his cosyn, Sir Thomas Kent, beyng lurning their te- nuors and natura brevium with Mr. Strett, att Dwelyng, was tabelyd at Hugh Talbot's, the said Hugh then dwelling where John Dyllon now dwellyth, and that Ffyllip Bermyngham, then Chief Justice of the King's Bench, att that time dwelled there, as Ann White dwellyth now, having one John Harper in his service, unto the which John Harper the said Sir Wil- liam and Sir Thomas, with other ther companyons, on holy- days resorted to lurne to harpe and to daunce, at the said Justice's place, wher was then John Bermyngham ; and Sir Wyllim and Sir Thomas soe being in Dvellyng, was send for to the marriage of Nicholas and Luttrelis doghter, to Lut ti .liston, where they, accompanyed with divers of Dublin, went, at the which tyme Nicholas was as tall a man as ever he was and the best and strongest archere that was at the marriage, and at the least, to the said Sir Wylliam's remembrans there was forty good bowes there ; and after Sir Wyllim, his father fell sicke, and send for him home ; but here he rao_t (ere he rode) home his father died, the Newyeres Day next before the death of Edward the 4th, that died the Ester then next ensu ing ; and the May following Sir Wyllim went to Londyn, John Bermingham and his wife, and Nicholas and his wife, bein\" alyve at his departinge.\" Hume observes, that during the Wars of the Roses all we cnn"], [37, "PREFACE. XXIX distinguish with certainty through the dark cloud which covers that period, is a scene of horror and bloodshed, savage man ners, arbitrary executions, and treacherous, dishonorable conduct in all parties. Much as we may condemn the arbi trary government of the Tudors, it seems to have been the means by which civilization made its principal advances among the English. In Ireland, that family never gained any in crease of authority in civil government ; and to this we may attribute the distraction and bloodshed which prevailed in the greater part of the country until the close of the reign of Elizabeth. During all that period no law existed but that of the sword ; the grand pursuit was the plunder of cattle, the burning of houses, and the murder of their inmates ; and so incorrigible did the inhabitants appear, that St. Leger, Lord Deputy of Henry VIII., gravely discusses, in one of his des patches, the propriety of endeavouring to exterminate the Irish ; but concludes it to be impossible, chiefly on account of their amazing faculty of enduring calamities and privations. 0) That the execution of the law had no greater latitude than the Pale is manifest by the Statute of the 13\u00b0 Henry VIII. , c. 3, which recites, that at that time the king's laws were obeyed and executed in the four shires only; and the instruc tions given to the Master of the Rolls, when sent into England about the same time, confirms the fact; for he is required to inform the king, that the land of Ireland was so much decayed that the king's laws were not obeyed twenty miles in compass. Wherefore grew the phrase: \"That they dwelt by west the law, which dwell beyond the river of the Barrow\" which is within thirty miles of Dublin. The English territory gradually decreased in extent: \u2014 \" So wonderful had those Irish lords encroached into the Pale, that afterwards, when the king (Henry VIII.) came to the crowne. taking in hand the general reformation of that country, it was found that the English Pale was restrained into four contries onlie, viz., Dublin, Kildare, Meath, and Louth, and those also not to be free from the Irish invasions; arid so weakened withal, and corrupted, that scant four persons-in any parish (\u00bb) State Papers."], [38, "XXX PREFACE. wore English habits, and coine and livery as current there as in the Irish countries, which was brought into the Pale by Sir James of Desmond, in the time of his government.\"0) And in the State Papers, part iii., vol. ii., p. 22, it is stated, that the inhabitants of the four shires \" hath been so spoiled, op pressed, and robbed, as they be not of ability to give to your grace any notable thing ;\" and \" to the shires above the Bar row, viz., Kilkenny, Tipperary, Waterford, and Wexford, the king's judges and officers cannot resort to minstre justice.\" The extent of territory under the influence of English do mination materially varied at different times ; and, in conse quence, the extent of country represented in the Irish par liaments, holden by the English viceroys, was not always the same. I may venture to presume, that representation in Irish parliaments was at all times co-extensive, not merely with the Pale, but with whatever portion of the Irish territory acknowledged a subjection to English dominion, and acquiesced in its legislation. This, however, has been denied, and Sir John Davies is tempted to assert, that the Par liament of 1613 was the first general representation of the people, which was not \" confined to the Pale.\" The reasons which induced Sir John Davies to rush at this conclusion was his anxiety to flatter the vanity of James I., a prince proud and vain of his government in Ireland. It afforded him the greatest degree of satisfaction to be told that he was the founder of a constitution in this country ; but as a fact, the positive limits of the Pale were never clearly defined. By the Statute of 10\u00b0 Henry VII., c. 23, the Acts of a Parliament which had been holden at Naas were annulled, because it was composed only of members summoned from the four shires of the Pale. It, therefore, cannot be con tended that no Parliament was summoned out of the Pale previous to that of James I. In the year 1520 the Mayor and Aldermen of Dublin being at dinner with the Earl of Surrey, Lord Deputy, news was brought that O'Neil was coming with a great force to invade <\u2022) Titus, B. xii,, British Museum."], [39, "PREFACE. XXXI the Pale. Forthwith, the Deputy commanded the Mayor and citizens to set forth and resist O'Neil, which they did.. ) Spenser, in his \" View of Ireland,\" written in the reign of Elizabeth, speaking of the invasion of Edward Bruce, says \u2014 \" He burned and spoiled all the old English Pale.\" Again \u2014 \" They marched into the Pale, which then was chiefly in the north, from the Point of Dunluce and beyond, unto Dublin, having in the midst Knockfergus (Carrickfergus), Belfast, Armagh, and Carlingford, which are now the most outbound and abandoned places in the Pale \u2014 and, indeed, not counted of the English Pale at all, for it stretcheth now no further than Dundalk towards the north.\" According as the English power extended so did the Pale ; and it was considered to comprise at some periods the counties of Antrim, Down, part of Armagh, Louth, Meath, West meath, Dublin, Kildare, King's and Queen's Counties, Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford, and part of Wick low ; but in general the name of the Pale was confined to the counties of Dublin, Louth, Meath, and Kildare. It appears that the Irish who dwelt within the Pale, and acknowledged the English authority, were considered as sub jects, and had to a certain extent the protection of English laws ; but all the Irish outside the Pale were styled Irish enemies, not being recognised as subjects ; while the Anglo- Irish, or Irish of English descent, who resisted the Govern ment, were termed English rebels, being accounted as subjects. The native Irish, according to Sir John Davies, being re puted as aliens, or rather enemies, it was adjudged no felony to kill a mere Irishman in time of peace ; and it appears that if an Englishman killed one of the mere Irish, he was only fined a mark. He states in a letter to Earl of Salisbury, in 1610, tha't \u2014 \" When the English Pale was first planted, all the natives were cleanly expelled, so as not one Irish family had so much as an acre of freehold in all the five counties of the Pale.\" The Pale, which was in its commencement very indis tinctly, if at all, defined, became in the fifteenth century i a) My MSS."], [40, "XXXII PREFACE. better known as the English part of the island, and more accurately marked, until at length an Act of Parliament was passed (10\u00b0 Henry VII., c. 34), for making a ditch to enclose the four shires to which the English dominion was at this time nearly confined. Henry VII., however, introduced a better system of administration, but the English power did not fully recover its stability till the reign of James I. The greater part of the Irish chieftains acknowledged no superior but the sword, and no law but their own will. In the sixteenth century an intercourse between the Irish cities was kept up by sea, or through defiles and passes occu pied by an envenomed and oppressed foe, with whom the legislation of the state forbade coalition or friendship. The acquired portion of inland country was erected into palatinates, whose chieftains preferred independent dominion to the salutary restraints of the law. There were no circuits for centuries after the introduction of the English law. Superior courts alone af forded any encouragement or reward; within each precinct local jurisdictions determined civil causes, and martial law, guided by palatines or tanists, formed the criminal code. The spirit and process of English law were thus confined to the capital and a narrow portion of the Pale. A staff of legal officers had been regularly kept up, and courts constantly held, which employed a few barristers, who expected, after a prac tice more laborious than lucrative, to attain judicial eminence ; the surrounding palatines, or Irish chieftains, rendering the active duties of the Common Bench or Common Place very trifling : the equitable jurisdiction of Chancery did not then exist, or at least had no extensive subject matter to operate on, and such of the inhabitants as desired to prepare themselves by legal skill for professional eminence, resorted to the English Inns of Court, where the law was cultivated in great perfection. In the reign of Henry VIII. the greater part of Ireland was out of the limits of counties, and sent no knights to Parliament ; nor did the Irish Government at this period esteem the in habitants of those parts fit to be trusted in the council of the realm. It was only in the thirty-fourth year of the reign of the hitter monarch that the county of Westmeath was formed"], [41, "PREFACE. XXXIII The ancient cities were but four ; the boroughs which sent burgesses to Parliament not above thirty, to which Mary and Elizabeth added forty-eight more, including two county con stituencies erected by the former, and nineteen by the latter. James I. created forty new boroughs at one stroke. As for the temporal lords, there were few indeed ; and of the spiritual lords, though the number was greater than it was when Sir John- Davies lived, those of the prelates, whether bishops or abbots, who were resident in what was called \"the Irish coun try,\" and did not acknowledge the king to be their patron, were never summoned. In the year 1515 the limits were thus described: \u2014 \"The English Pale doth stretche and extend from the towne of Doundalke to the towne of Derver, to the town of Ardye, allwaie on the lyfte syde, leving the marche on the right syde, and so to the town of Sydan, to the town of Kenlys, to the town of Dengle, to Kilcoke, to the towne of Clanne, to the towne of Naasse, to the Bryge of Cucullyn, to the towne of Ballymore, and so backward to the towne of Ramore, and to the towne of Rathcoole, to the towne of Talaght, and to the towne of Dalky, leavinge alwaye the marche on the right hande from Dondalke following the said course to the towne of Dalkye.\" 0 ) This district of about thirty miles around Dublin was as much as the Government could hold in subjection. The country was so intersected with woods and bogs, and the Irish were so hardy and active, that a victory over them was attended with no considerable result \u2014 most of them could escape to in accessible places. War could neither impoverish nor incom mode them \u2014 it was their pastime ; and though they were not steady in battle, they were ever ready to renew it. Sir Edward Bellingham was the first Deputy from the reign of Edward III. to the time of Edward VI., who enlarged the Pale by defeating the Moores and Connors, and building the forts of Leix and Offaly. This service he performed with 600 horse and 400 foot, as appears by the Treasurer's account, in the office of the Remembrancer in England. \"And the Earl of Sussex put the last hand to this work, and rooting out these (.I State Papers.

XXXIV two rebellious septs, planted English colonies in their rooms, which in all the tumultuous times since have kept their habi tations, their loyalty, and their religion.\" In the \"Annals of the Four Masters\" we read that William, Earl of Kildare, prepared to return to Ireland in the spring of the year 1598; he embarked, accompanied by some gen tlemen of Meath and of the English Pale, and having sailed till out of sight at sea, none of them were ever seen alive afterwards ; it was from other countries, in two months after, that an account of their deaths reached Ireland. It had been usual in Ireland, says Leland, previous to the holding a parliament, for the lords of the Pale to be summoned and consulted as to the time and circumstances, and also as to what business should be transacted in this assembly ; this custom is insisted upon in the petition of the Lords to James I. in the year 1613: when, however, it was moved in Council that it should be observed, the Lord Deputy Wentworth de feated the motion. Dr. Boate, who, in the year 1652, wrote \" Ireland's Natural History ,\"00 thus describes the Pale : \u2014 \" There is yet another division of Ireland, whereby the whole land is divided into two parts, the English Pale and the land of the meer Irish. The English Pale comprehendeth only four counties, one whereof is in Ulster, viz., Louth, and the other three in Leins ter, to wit, Meath, Dublin, and Kildare ; the original of which division is this : the English at the first conquest, under the reign of Henry II. , having within a little time conquered great part of Ireland, did afterwards, in the space of not very many years, make themselves masters of almost all the rest, having expelled the natives (called the wild Irish, because in all manner of wildness, they may be compared with the most barbarous nations of the earth), into the desert woods and mountains. But afterwards being fallen at odds among them selves, and making several great wars the one upon the other, the Irish thereby got the opportunity to recover now this, and then that part of the land ; whereby and through the deo-ene- (\u00bb) This, with other useful Irish tracts for private circulation by the patriotic and treatises, from the year 1613 to the munificence of Mr. Alexander Thorn year 1769 have been recently published 2 vols., 8vo."], [43, "PREFACE. XXXV rating of a great many from time to time, who joining them selves with the Irish, took upon them their wild fashions and their language, the English in length of time came to be so much weakened, that at last nothing remained to them of the whole kingdom worth speaking of but the great cities, and the forenamed four counties, to which the name of Pale was given, because the authority and government of the kings of England and the English colonies or plantations, which before had been spread over the whole land, now were reduced to so small a compass, as it were impaled within the same. And although since the beginning of the present age, and since King James his coming to the crown of England, the whole island was reduced under the obedience and government of the English laws, and replenished with English and Scotch colonies, nevertheless the name of the Pale, which, in the old signification, was now out of season, remained in use, and is so still ; even since the last bloody rebellion, wherein the in habitants of almost all the Pale, although all of them of Eng lish descent, have conspired with the native Irish to shake off the government of the crown of England, extinguish the re formed religion with their professors, and quite to root them out of Ireland.\" During the four centuries which intervened between the conquest of Ireland and the closing years of Elizabeth, the portion of the island held by the English colonists was gradu ally enlarged in proportion as the skill and prowess of the settlers prevailed over the gallant though disunited opposition of the native chiefs. The English Pale was defined by a boundary even still more clearly marked than the surround ing line, on which were formed the fortified towns and castles which afforded protection from the inroads of the Irish. The Pale expressed something more than a territorial distinction. It expressed not only a certain defined district, but also a dif ference in race, difference in language, and difference in laws, between those who were found within and without its confines. The distinction between a beleaguered city with its garrison, and a besieging army, was not so great, nor could the feelings entertained by each to the other have been more embittered, c2"], [44, "XXXVI PREFACE. than were the sentiments entertained by the English within towards the Irish without the Pale. The English laws, which the colonists had imported with them, shed no protection over even those with whom they had established communication, and crimes the most atrocious were committed with impu nity, provided the victims belonged to the hostile race. On the Memoranda Roll of the year 1278, is a proceeding against Robert de la Roche and Adam le Wales, who were indicted for perpetrating a capital offence on Margaret O'Rorke. The culprits being arraigned, pleaded \" non culpa, pro eo quod predicta Marguereta est Hibernica :\" this issue being found in favour of the delinquents, they were acquitted. It would appear also that the learned administrators of the law did not discourage the wager of battle (\" vadiatio duelli\"), which had been frequently resorted to by the English of the Pale; although the members of the corporations of Dublin, Cashel, Waterford, New Ross, and other towns, were especi ally exempt from it by their charters. There is a curious instance of this ancient legal practice on the Plea Roll of 6\u00b0 Edward I. \" Geoffry de Prendergast challenges Paganus de Hynteberg for 5 carucates of land as his inheritance. Peganus came and defended his right thereto by the body of his champion, and Geoffry is prepared to support his claim by another. The court orders that a duel be waged at Drogheda: \"The champions came armed; they fought; the plaintiff conquered the defendant, and it was there fore determined by the court that Geoffry should recover possession of the lands.\".) And on the Patent and Close Roll of the 2\u00b0 Edward II., is a similar interesting discus sion: \u2014 \"Osberte Furlong sues and challenges Laurence Cas; Laurence comes and defends the violence and wrono and is prepared to defend with his body whatsoever is alleged against him; the court therefore orders the wager of battle.

Conor accepted the challenge, and the weapons, which were sword and target, being chosen by the defendant, the next day was prepared for the battle, and pa trons were assigned to each to introduce them into the lists. The day being come, and the court sitting, the combatants were likewise seated on two stools, one at each end of the inner court of the castle of Dublin. Most of the military officers were present, to render this action the more solemn, and the pleadings being read, the combatants were stripped to their shirts and searched by Secretary Fenton, then each of them took his corporal oath that his quarrel was true, and that he would justify the same with his blood; at the sound of trumpet, they began to fight with great resolution ; \" but at length Conor MacCormac being twice wounded in his leg and once in his eye, designed to close with his adver sary; but Teig, being too strong for him, pummelled him till he loosened his murrion, and then he easily stunned him, and with O'Conor's own sword cut off his head and presented .

Regulations touching the non residence of the clergy were followed by an ordinance for the regulation of the church and state, and for the effectual administration of the English laws. By this ordinance the parliaments of Ireland were regulated according to the in stitutions of England, for before this time, the conventions in Ireland were not so properly parliaments as assemblies of great men.(a) That the mere Irish were reputed aliens, appears by several records and charters of denization. On the Plea Roll of the 28\u00b0 Edward III., we find the following interesting record. Simon Neal brought an action of trespass against William Newlagh, for breaking his close at Clondalkin ; the defendant pleaded that the plaintiff \" est Hibernicus et non de quinque sanguinibus,\" and prayed judgment. The plaintiff replied, quod ipse est de quinque sanguinibus, viz., de les O'Neiles de Ulton (Ulster), qui per concessionem progenitorum Domini Regis, libertatibus Anglicis gaudere debent et utuntur, et pro liberis hominibus reputantur. The defendant rejoined that the plaintiff is not of the O'Neils of Ulster, \u2014 \"nee de quinque sanguinibus;\" issue was joined, which, being found for the plaintiff, he had judgment to recover his damages. By this record it appears that five principal bloods or septs of the Irish were by special grace enfranchised and enabled to take the benefit of the English laws, and that the nation of the put the said commandment, or any pro clamation or any other thing contrary or prejudicial to the said ancient customs, privileges, and franchises, in execution, on pain of forfeiture of all his lands and goods which he or any other hath to his use within the said land, and, above this, of a thousand marks, one half to the king, and the other half to the party who will sue in this case against any officer or minister by writ of scire facias, or by any other action in the law in this behalf convenient. It is also ordained by the said authority, that every appeal of treason sued in this land shall be deter- mined before the constable and marshall of the said land for the time being, and within the said land, and in no other place ; and if any person hereafter shall appeal against any other person within the said land, and the matter of the said appeal be found and proved not true, th at then such person taking or commenc- ing such an appeal shall thereby be adjudged to death, and that no pardon shall avail in that case.\" \u2014 Translated from the original Roll.

On the Plea Roll of the 4\u00b0 Edward III., is recorded a suit between Walter Ultagh and Thomas de Penkiston for ten shillings of silver, in which the defendant pleaded that he ought not to be compelled to answer the plaintiff, \" quia est Hibernicus.\" Ultagh replied that \" Dominus Rex statuit in parliamento suo quod omnes Hibernici, ad pacem DominiRegis exist entes, respondentur ad communem legem.\" The court decided in favour of the Irishman. But villeinage, of which so little trace can be found in Irish documents, was anciently quite prevalent; and there is no doubt, that men of Irish race, living on church lands, were destitute of any rights in their own labour, and were in a state of mere slavery, a condition similar with that class in England called \" villeins en gross.\" On the Pipe Roll of the diocese of Cloyne of the year 1348, will be found the follow ing finding of a jury: \u2014 \"That John, who was called Lowis, is mere Irish, and of the race of O'Karny, and that all his goods, lands, and tenements, are the property of the Lord Bishop of Cloyne, because all of the race of O'Karny are Irishmen of the Church St. Colman, and born [in servitude].

There never was a period in our history, even in the darkest times, in which the remonstrances of the middle classes against prescriptive abuses were not faithfully seconded by some of an aristocracy that did not stand, as a caste, apart from \"the people.\" The Bill passed after some opposition, such as is always at hand to resist what is dreaded as \"in- novation,\" and the lords added a clause to provide that records and other docu- ments should be written in a plain legible hand, such as that in which Acts of Par- liament are engrossed. The tenacity with which some minds, even of a high order, cling to custom and precedent, is shown in the lament of Blackstone that the old law Latin was disused. Lord Campbell adds \u2014 \" I have heard the late Lord EUenborough, from the Bench, re gret the change, on the ground that it has had the tendency to make attorneys illiterate.\" ( . Previous to the reign of Edward the Third, all public documents were written in Norman-French ; but by the statute of the 36\u00b0 of that king it was enacted that all law proceedings should be conducted in the English tongue, but be entered and enrolled in Latin, which was observed until the protectorate of Cromwell, when it was enacted that the English language should alone be used in the public records ; and the ancient practice of using a corrupt Latin for written pleadings was abolished, with many other legal abuses. This innova- tion was not observed after the restora- tion of Charles the Second ; and when the monarchy was restored, with much of its inherent good and a considerable portion of its trappings of evil, it was held wise and reverential to restore the old law language, and Latin continued to be used down to the reign of George the Second. In the year 1731, the ma- gistrates of the North and East Ridings of Yorkshire presented a petition to the House of Commons, complaining \"that the obliging grand-jurymen at the ses- sions of the peace to make their pre- sentments in a language which few of them understood, and the suffering, in any of the proceedings of the courts of justice, or in any of the transactions of the law, whereby the person or property of the subject may be affected, the use of a language not intelligible and of a character not legible but by the learned in the law, were great occasion of the delay of justice, and gave room to most dangerous frauds.\" Lord Chancellor King, described as \" one of the people,\" saw the necessity of attending to the prayer of the Yorkshire petitions. He directed a bill to be introduced to the House of Lords to enact \" that all pro- ceedings in courts of justice should be done into English ;\" the preamble setting forth \"that the common people might have knowledge and understanding of what was alleged or done for and against them in the process and pleadings, the judgment and entries in the cause.\" The judges, speaking through the Lord Chief Justice, were decidedly against the change \u2014 \" difficulties would arise in translating the law out of Latin into English ; law suits would be multiplied in regard to the interpretation of Eng- In Scotland the proceedings of courts of justice were never recorded in Latin, but that language was used in all char ters by the crown, and other crown writs ; and also in all cases of service (as it is technically called) of heirs, until 1847, when its use was almost entirely abro gated by different statutes passed that year, under the direction of the late Lord Rutherford, then Lord Advocate of Scot land. The great improvements effected at that time in the law, and the practice of the law in Scotland, by these and other statutes, which were carried through by his Lordship, are universally allowed. It has been questioned, however, how far the change specified was expedient, as the meaning of words and phrases in a living language may come in course of time to vary, which can never hap pen in a dead one. This remark, at the same time, is applicable to deeds only \u2014 such as charters \u2014 and not to the proceedings of courts of justice. Notes and Queries \u2014 Hist.

Perhaps the most ancient statute we find on the subject is that of Richard I. ; but the Irish Brehon laws were more ancient than the chartulary of the monastery, or the common law of England ; and although the Irish, \" from the beginning of time,\". ) had been governed by the Brehon law, the par ticulars of that code are as little known at this period as if it had never existed. The laws of the Irish parliaments of the Pale, enacted since the arrival of the English, are almost wholly unknown. As I have already stated, the few Acts previous to the seventeenth century which appear in our Statute Book bear but a small proportion to the number which still remain wrapt in the mouldering parchments on which they had been originally recorded. It is not, therefore, pre sumption to say, that those who have hitherto affected to treat of the affairs of Ireland, were in a state of ignorance of the sources from which they could obtain the most instructive portion of their labours. In the earliest ages of civilized Europe, the Chancellor was the chief civil officer employed by the monarch to draw up his commands in a formal manner, and authenticated them with his master's seal, of which he was the Keeper. The earliest information relative to the publication of our legislative proceedings will be found in the \"Red Book of the Exchequer,\" which contains a mandate from Edward II. to the Chancellor of Ireland, in the year 1318, to have the Statutes of Lincoln and York enrolled, exemplified, and sent to all the King's courts, and every county of the land ; and commanding the officers of these courts to cause the same to be published and firmly observed..1) By a writ, dated 12th May, in the twelfth year of the reign of Henry III., the King orders his Justiciary, that on a certain day and place, he should convoke the archbishops, (\u00bb) Hume. <b) \"Red Book of the Exchequer ;\" Dublin."], [52, "XLIV PREFACE. bishops, abbots, priors, earls and barons, knights, freeholders, and the bailiffs of every county; that he should cause to be read before them the charter to which King John affixed his seal, and which he caused to be sworn to by the mag nates of Ireland, concerning the observance of the laws and customs of England in Ireland ; and also to cause proclama tion to be made in every county of Ireland, that the laws and customs should be observed, with the exception, that neither for the death nor the chattels of the Irish should any one be impleaded until after fifteen days of Saint Michael in that year. The Charter of King John was transcribed into the \" Red Book of the Exchequer,\" where it is still to be seen; and King Henry, by patent, acquainted his subjects in Ireland that he had conferred on them those liberties, a copy of which he transmitted, sealed with the seals of his officers. The copy then transmitted has some variations from King John's charter; it is generally styled the \"Magna Charta Hiberni\u00e6,\" or, in ancient pleadings, the \" Grand Charter.\" When Prince Edward had the government of Ireland, a parliament was summoned, and one of the statutes passed in that parliament is still preserved by recital.

A general Parliament was held in Ireland in the reign of Edward I. for the purpose of raising a supply of 10,000 foot, fully accoutred, and sent over in the King's service, the proceedings of which were recorded in the \" Black Book of Christ Church.\" In this assembly several statutes were passed, each commencing methodically with a recital of some matter requiring redress, and generally ending with the remedy now provided or enacted. The King's ordinance against the Pollards, or \" Moneta Pollardoruin,\" and the pro ceedings of that parliament, were published by being tran scribed into the \" Red Book of the Exchequer.\" In the suc ceeding reign, owing, as it may be, to the growing importance of legal proceedings, the increasing practice of regular regis tration, and the better preservation of public records, we find fuller and more satisfactory evidence of our parliamentarv assemblies. In the second year of that king's reign, a parlia ment was held at Kilkenny, and eight chapters of enactments then passed are preserved on the rolls of the Exchequer. By letters patent under the great seal, and dated in \" full parliament at Kilkenny,\" the 11th July, in the nineteenth year of his reign, King Edward certified that, at Easter, in the thirteenth year of his reign, there were certain ordinances made in a parliament held at Dublin, \" to the honor of God and of Holy Church, the profit of his people, and the main tenance of his peace;\" and that the statutes and ordinances so made and enacted were afterwards confirmed by a parliament held at Kilkenny ; all which ordinances, therefore, so made and ordained, the King now accepts and for ever confirms. At that period there existed no Statute Rolls, and whatever copies of ancient statutes still remain are principally to be found amongst the records of the law courts, where such statutes were imme diately sent for the guidance of the judges and their officers, published in the Statutes of the Realm, tween the Clergy of the two Cathedrals, It likewise contains various articles re- Christ Church and Saint Patrick's; lating to tithes of merchandise, and tithe some curious lists of prices; and many fish of the Liffey, for which the Dean and other things illustrative of history and Chapter obtained a decree against the antiquities, particularly those of Dublin Corporation of Dublin; a Dispute be- and the Church."], [54, "XLVI PREFACE, as also amongst the archives of ecclesiastical and lay corpora tions; to the former, that they might be promulgated in the cathedral and parochial churches, by the archbishops, as is commanded by the statute of 2\u00b0 Edward II., and to the latter, that they should be read and published by mayors and other officers within their corporate liberties, as was directed in the instance of those very statutes now under consideration. For this latter purpose a record was made of the statutes of 13\u00b0 Edward II., by exemplification under the great seal, whereby the King recited and exemplified those statutes, and sent them to the mayor and bailiff's of Dublin, commanding them to cause the same to be read, published, and firmly maintained throughout their bailiwick. This exemplification was first, however, recorded in the Exchequer amongst the other ancient statutes there preserved. We find on the Memoranda Roll of the 9\u00b0 Edward III., that the Bishop of Emly was summoned to a parliament, and, absent ing himself, was fined. On his petition, the cause of his absence was inquired into, and it was ascertained, by inquisi tion, that on the Vigil of the Nativity, as the Bishop was riding towards the church, his palfrey stumbled and threw him on the earth, whereby he was grievously wounded, and had three of his ribs fractured; in consequence, during the whole time of the parliament, he lay so sick that his life was despaired of, and without peril of his body he could not approach the parliament ; whereupon the King, having consi deration of the Bishop's misfortune, and wishing to show him special grace, ordered him to be exonerated and discharged from the fine. _ In the year 1351 a parliament sat at Dublin, and several statutes were there enacted. Those statutes are enrolled; though, like many others, they have never been published. By one the English Statute of Labourers is accepted, and the same ordered to be sent by writ to each sheriff, seneschal, and mayor, for the purpose of being proclaimed.

The exemplification commences in the King's name, with a recital that the roll was found with Sir Christopher Preston on his arrest, and that it was exhibited before him and the Council at Trim on the 9th of January following ; and after reciting the whole contents of the roll, the exemplifica tion concludes as follows : \u2014 \" Nos autem tenores articulorum pr\u00e6dictorum, de assensu prefati Locum tenentis et concilii pre dicti, tenore pr\u00e6sentium duximus exemplificandum, et has lit teras nostras fieri fecimus patentes.

XLIX Earl summoning the nobles to meet him at Kilkenny, at a time when the Justiciary was unable to congregate a parliament in Dublin ; indignant and inflamed at the at tempt of the Crown to resume possession of the estates held by the Anglo-Irish, and the exclusion of all who were either Irish by birth, marriage, or Irish quoad their estates, from the direction of government affairs. The remonstrants commence by attributing the diminution of the royal power to the inso lence, excesses, and corruption of bad officers, whose frauds on the Crown are in several instances specified; those ministers holding many offices through covetousness of the fees; and pray the king that no minister should hold more than one office. They next loudly complain of absen tees, who set their seignories and lands to farm ; and with respect to the statute of resumption, they state, that in Scot land, Gascony, and Wales, rebellions were raised in times past against the Crown, but they, the remonstrants, had always deported themselves well and loyally, and had served the king and his progenitors against the Scotch, at their own cost; yet they had been misrepresented to him by those who were sent from England to govern this country, who had no know ledge of its circumstances, nor means to live, except by extor tion under colour of their offices ; and that his Majesty and his progenitors, by charters for services rendered, had granted estates to divers persons, which were peaceably possessed until of late when his ministers there, by writs from England, recalled and repealed such grants for their own singular profit, contrary to reason, as the grantees and their ancestors well deserved the same, and from time to time defended and maintained the country: wherefore they prayed his Majesty to order that they be not ousted of their freeholds, without being called in judgment, according to the grand charter On the Close Roll of the 16th of Edward III., will be found his Majesty's answer \u2014 recognising the remonstrants as his \" dear and dutiful\" \u2014 and addressing them for aid towards his expedition into France. At a Parliament summoned by Poigning about twelve months after his arrival in Ireland, the Statutes of Kilkenny d"], [58, "L PREFACE. were revived and confirmed, except one, prohibiting the use of the Irish language ; it was then commanded, that ir_ future the statutes should be written in two books, and carefully enrolled by the Lord Treasurer in the King's Bench and Common Pleas. It was further directed that the Patents of Office to the Chancellor, Treasurer, Judges, Barons, and Clerk of the Rolls, should be made out during the King's pleasure, and no longer for term of life. The first Acts in the English language were passed in a Par liament held at Drogheda, on Monday next after the Feast of Andrew the Apostle, before Sir Edward Poigning, 10\u00b0 Henry VII., 1495. One of them is an Act declaring the rate which soldiers should pay for their meat and drink in time of war; it provides that \u2014 \" Soldiers may be quartered on the subjects in time of hostility, and that they ne anie of them shall take of any of the army for their meat and drink above l\\d. for one meale, and for his servant, Id. ; for every horse that shall belong to the army, they shall not pay above Id. for six field-sheaves, with a double band, and litter ; that for lacke thereof, they ne none of them have cause to complain ; penalty 12d. for refusal.\" In 1537, Justice Luttrell complains, that \" fewe or none can have knowledge of all Statutes made in this land, because they be kept in the Treasury, and no books made of them, by reason whereof manie offendeth therein from ignorance.

Cotton, British Muse\u00bbm."], [59, "LI PREFACE. It is certain that the Statutes, whether printed or unedited, do not go higher than the early part of the reign of Edward II. There are recitals, indeed, in English records and in Irish Statutes, of more antient Irish Acts of Parliament ; but these recitals are not conclusive evidence of the fact ; and as for certain exemplifications, even these are not conclusive in the minds of those who assert the forgery of the \" modus tenendi parliamentum in Anglia et Hibernia.\" The true age of this modus, which purports to be of the reign of Henry FitzEmpress (Henry II.), is by Selden and Prynne decided to be of the age of Richard II. or Edward IV. The printed Statutes of Ireland previous to the 10\u00b0 of Henry VII., are only translations of the original Acts in Nor- man-French, which originals have never been published ; and there is every reason to suppose the translations have never been corrected with the originals; of this the following is an amusing instance. \u2014 By the 8\u00b0 Edward IV., c. 70, it was enacted, that all the English Statutes concerning rapes should be adopted in Ireland ; but the words, \" de toutz maners dez rapes \" in the original, having been omitted in the translation, the printed Act appears to adopt all the Statute law of England^ instead of that part only which concerned rapes. Therefore the greatest attention and fidelity should be observed in the translation of those important records. An eminent law- yer, writing on this subject, says, \" I have put every Statute in the tongue that it was first written in ; for these that were first written in Latin or in French dare I not presume to translate into English for fear of misrepresentation. For many words and terms be there, in divers Statutes, both in Latin and in French, which be very hard to translate aptly into English.\".) The legal institutions of Ireland were avowedly formed on the English model, in other words, the English laws and cus toms were introduced into Ireland with the English rule. The judges, in both countries, have ever laid it down as an acknowledged and settled dictum, that a perfect identity of the common laws and legal customs of England has existed in (\u00bb) Epi9tle to W. Rastall's collection of the English Statutes. _ 2"], [60, "LII PREFACE. all ages among the Anglo-Irish, and those Irish who resided within the Pale, and were lieges of the King. Mathew Paris states, that \" Henry the Second granted the laws of Eng land to the people of Ireland, which were joyfully received by them all, and confirmed by the King, having first re ceived their oaths for their observation of them.\" It is prob able that this was a grant to all the Irish who chose to adopt it; but as O'Conor, King of Connaught, O'Neill, King of Kinelowen, or Tyrone, O'Donell of Tyrconnell, and other Irish chiefs, became but vassal princes, \" reges sub eo ut ho mines sui,\" paying to the English sovereign annual tribute, in acknowledgment of his sovereignty, it is not probable that they would immediately change the laws or customs of their ter ritories ; and we find by a writ of the 6\u00b0 of King John, that no one was to be impleaded for the chattels, or even the life of an Irishman, until after Michaelmas Term in that year; there fore, if the boon was general, it must then have been consid ered forfeited by the frequent attempts made by the native Irish to shake off the English yoke after Henry's return to England. The writ of the 6\u00b0 of John, however, seems to imply, that after Michaelmas, 1205, the benefit of the laws extended to all the Irish as well as the English, although in the reigns of Henry III. and his successors, the records show that the Irish had not, during those periods, the benefit of the laws of England. The Irish lawyers were all educated in England, and the early judges were mostly Englishmen, sent over to administer the English law in its integrity. The Viceroys were also English or Irish noblemen in possession of large estates in England. They generally held the sword but a very few years. From the year 1173 to 1200 there were no less than seventeen Chief Governors ; in the thirteenth century, forty six ; in the fourteenth, ninety-three; in the fifteenth, eight i/ five; in the sixteenth, seventy-six ,- in the seventeenth, seventy-nine ; in the eighteenth, ninety-four. All were natu rally attached to the English laws and customs, but held office for so short a time, that they were not long enouo-h in Ireland to form laws in accordance with their own no-"], [61, "LIII PREFAC_. tions. The customs of the mere Irish were indeed different, but they had no influence on the administration of the laws. Where the Irish had power, they superseded the English law altogether, and introduced the Brehon, or Irish law, but where there was English rule there was English law. The Viceroys and the Judges knew no laws or customs but those of England, and when that was the case, no arbitrary variations could have occurred in the administration of the English law in Ireland. The earliest mention of a Parliament, by name, in the records of Ireland, is to be found in the great Roll of the Pipe of 10\u00b0 to 12\u00b0 Edward I. In the Red Book of the Exchequer, and on the Close Roll of the 13\u00b0 Edward I.,0 ) is the following me morandum: \u2014 \"Quod die Veneris in festo exaltationis sanct\u00e6 crucis anno regni Edward 13\u00b0, apud Wynton, liberata fue runt Rogero Bretan, clerico venerabilis patris Stephani, Water fordensis Episcopi, tune Justiciarii Hiberni\u00e6, quedam statuta, per regem et consilium suum edita et provisa, viz., statutum Westm. 1. statutum, post coronationem regis editum, et sta tutum Glouc. et statutum pro mercatoribus factum,et statutum Westm. 11. in Parliamento regis pasch\u00e6, anno predicto, provi sum et factum, in Hibernia deferenda et ibidem proclamanda et observanda.\" The first are declared to be statutes enacted by the King and his Council ; the latter enacted in the King's Par liament, id est, the King's Court of Justice, which were trans mitted to Ireland, to be observed there as the law, although Parliaments, or assemblies called Parliaments, were held pre viously in that country. In the Black Book of Christ's Church of the 26th of Edward I., 1297, we find described the component parts of the Parlia ment held in Dublin in that year. I regret its length prevents its entire insertion here, and I must content myself with a passing notice of some of the important features of this most curious and valuable document.

Meath should be a county of itself, as well the lands of the liberty of Trim, the lands of Theobald Verdun, and the lands of the Crosses, within the precincts of Meath.

No one shall keep more kerns or idlemen than he is able to support, or hire or take any idlemen from the neighbouring lords by force, against his will. It shall not be lawful to hold truce with the Irish who are at war, or who are not in the King's peace, unless the truce shall be universal ; and as it frequently happens that when the Irish have given their solemn oath to the Chief Justice, to abstain from sudden irruptions, few or none are to be found ready to resist, redress, or interrupt their misdeeds, by which very often the lands of the marches are frequently devastated \u2022"], [63, "PREFACE. LV to prevent this evil it is agreed that immediately, as soon as the Irish, by homicide, burning, or taking preys, should com- mence war, all persons dwelling in the liberty or country where those Irish dwell, and their neighbours, with one accord and simultaneously should rise against the Irish, and maintain war against them at their own expense, until the Irish be reduced to peace or truce obtained. Also, in consequence of the density of the bogs and the depths of the adjacent morasses, the Irish assume a confident boldness in sudden de- linquency, chiefly on the King's highway, in places so over- grown with wood, and so thick and difficult, that scarcely even a foot passenger was able to pass ; by which the Irish, when the mischief was done, run into some bog or wood, which they are able to pass, although the English are not able to pursue them, and not being followed, they escape without in- jury, or if they suffer themselves to be approached, are able to avoid being apprehended ; upon which it is ordained that the Lord of the woods, with his tenants, through which anciently was the King's highway, should sufficiently clear the passage where the way ought to be, and at their expense, cut and shorten the wood, so as to make the way wide enough, and clear from underwood and trees. But if the lord be unable, then the King or the Chief Justice should have the assistance of all the adjacent country. They shall repair the bridges in their district, aud if unable to incur an expense so great, the country shall supply the means. And the whole community of Leinster, which was lately but one liberty, shall assist and contribute to the maintenance of the war against the Irish. Every Eng- lishman, in the head and countenance, shall adopt the manners and tonsure of the English, and shall not again presume to turn back the hair into a culan ,- and to arrest their bodies if it be notorious that they wear the Irish costume ; no one shall plead as an Englishman wearing the Irish dress, but shall answer as an Irishman if in a similar case a question shall arise. The various proportions, denominations, and territorial divi sions of land mentioned in those volumes require a short notice. A paper on this subject was written by Sir Thomas Larcom, in the year 1846, which was published in the follow-"], [64, "LVI PREFACE. ing year, by order of the Government, in the first part of the relief correspondence of the Commissioners of Public Works. This paper, although professing to be merely an outline, con tains much valuable information in a concise form ; it closes with a reference to the ancient manuscripts of the Brehon Laws as the source from which the most valuable information on this subject generally is to be derived. The History of the Down Survey, by Sir Thomas Larcom, is also interspersed with interesting information relative to the several territorial denominations. The Rev. Doctor Reeves, the eminent Irish Ecclesiologist, and Secretary of the Irish Academy, well known to the learned by his elaborate edition of Adamnan's Life of Columkille, lately read a valuable paper on the Townland Distribution of Ireland before the Academy, and I have not only profited by his great research on this occasion, but on every other where the subject of our Irish records is concerned. \" The Tate was estimated at sixty acres, and a sixteenth was the unit; and this came to be distinguished as a townland. In Cavan the first division was a ballibet, identical with the ballybetagh of other parts; of this the proximate species was the poll or pole, sixteen of which constituted the ballybet. Each poll contained two gallons, each gallon two pottles, de scending even to a subdivision called pints. In Down the prevailing denomination was the ballyboe or cow land, sometimes called the carewe, from the Latin carucata or plowland, which has been estimated at sixty acres ; three of these formed the quarterland, and twelve the ballybetao-h ; sometimes a smaller division was in use called the sessiagh. In Antrim the townland, latinized villa and villata, was the prevailing denomination at the commencement of the seven teenth century : the higher division was, as in Down, the quarterland, that is, the conventional quarter of the ancient ballybetagh. Here as elsewhere the original name of the quarterland was often lost, while the specific ones were re tained, or the generic name was given in exchange to a prin cipal component part. In Antrim we have still the tradi tional aggregation in the \" four towns\" of Ahoghill, the"], [65, "LVII PREFACE. \" eight towns \" of Muckamore, and the \" sixteen towns \" of Antrim. The divisions in Donegal were ballybetaghs, de scending to quarters, ballyboes, and sessiaghs, of which the ballyboe, with occasional sessiaghs, was the denomination which eventually merged in the general townland. The divi sions in Donegal were ballybetaghs, descending to quarters, ballyboes, and sessiaghs, of which the ballyboe, with the occa sional sessiaghs, was the denomination which eventually merged in the general townlands. In Londonderry it was found by inquisition that thirteen ballyboes were equivalent to the ballybetagh. In Armagh the prevailing denomination was the \" ballyboe or town,\" which contained three sessiaghs; in several instances we meet with proportions of ten ballyboes in this county, which were estimated at 1,000 acres, that is 100 acres, with their appurtenances, to the ballyboe. In Tyrone as in Armagh, the ballyboe or townland was the prevailing denomination, and contained three \" sheshawghes \" or ses siaghs ; it had besides a compound denomination called tal lagh, consisting of a ballyboe and a sessiagh, that is, a town land and a third. The popular division of Longford was the cartron, which was estimated at from 60 to 160 acres; four of these made a quarter or ploughland. The cartron is repre sented by the modern \" townland.\" In Louth the carucate or carewe, of which 120, sometimes 60 acres, were the prevailing contents. Meath had the plowland, and under it the carucate and townland. In the direction of Cavan we find the poll. Westmeath had the cartron and carucate. An inquisition finds three carucates to consist of 360 acres, or 120 acres each. We also meet \"a half carucate,\" otherwise a \"half plowland.\" The county of Dublin was considerably subdivided. The prevailing denomination was the plowland or townland. Kil dare was similarly distributed. Wicklow had vill\u00e6, villat\u00e6, hamlets, lands, and cowlands, or ballyboes. The divisions of Carlow were mart-lands or beef-lands, and fractional parts, also pennv-lands; the half and quarter mart-lands are now represented by the townlands. Thus, too, in Wexford, besides quarters, carucates, and plowlands, we find an inquisi tion which sets out the barony of Ballaghkene as containing"], [66, "lviii PREFACE. thirteen mart-lands. In Kilkenny, also, we find the carucate and mart land ; it had besides a denomination called capell lands, three of which made a plowland, and a subdivision called a horse's-bed or horseman's-bed, containing twenty or thirty acres. King's County had the carucate and cartron. The English of Waterford reckoned by plowlands ; the native Irish by mart-lands and the subdenomination, horsemen's-beds. Tipperary had capell-lands of about 400 acres, English mea sure, each capell-land containing four quarter-meers. Limerick reckoned by quarters, each divisible into four quarter-meers ; it had also a subdenomination called a gnieve. In Cork we find the plowland Latinized carucata, and the gneeve a sub denomination. In Kerry the divisions were quarters and plowlands as one to three, each plowland estimated at 120 acres. In Connaught \"the prevailing distribution was into townlands of vague import; quarters, the fourth part of the former; cartron, the fourth of a quarter; gneeve, the sixth of a quarter. The cartron was computed at thirty native acres.\" (a ) Sir John Davis, in one of his letters, states that \" Monaghan (though but a small county) was divided into five baronies, 100 ballybetaghs, and 1,600 tates (or subdenominations), each containing about sixty acres. Many of these have Eng lish as well as Irish names ; and some have two or three of both.\" He adds that the Gavelkind laws multiplied subdivi sions to such a degree that almost every man had a patrimony, and, were it but an acre or two, called it his \" country.\" All grants of Seignories made in Ireland were in consid eration of the homage and service which the grantees and their heirs should render to the Crown, such service compre hending military and pecuniary aid towards the defence and preservation of the King and his realm. In consequence, those estates were held to be but stipends or fees assigned for the maintenance of those from whom such important duties were expected ; and where the possession of such seignories might be considered as tending to the danger of the King or his people, we have instancesO) of the King seizing the cas- <\u00bb) Reeves 's Townland Distribution of Ireland."], [67, "LIX PREFACE. ties, and resuming the estates before granted by him or his predecessors. In furtherance of this system, we find many entries on the Rolls, of grants occasionally made in money to fortify and repair the castles of the barons, who by war or otherwise, were unable to do so themselves; and when any seignories came into the King's hands by mi nority, escheat, or absence on the King's business, the care, defence, and munitioning of them were duties assigned to the King's Justiciary or his Lord Marshal. From these circumstances it must be evident that the defence and maintenance of the seignories granted to the barons, and by means of which their services to the Crown were to be rendered, were duties understood and imperative, and that they were so considered abundant records testify. Thus, in the 2\u00b0 of John we have his writ, wherein he commands those holding estates in the Marches to strengthen their castles against the Feast of St. John, so that damage may not arise to his realm as theretofore ; otherwise he will resume those estates, and give them to others who will fortify them. Under a similar threat the citizens of Dublin were ordered to fortify their city, which they held of the King ; and in the year 1220, it was a matter of grace shown towards the King's Marshal of Ireland that his lands were not forfeited and seized into the King's hands for his neglect in leaving them unfortified. The reign of Henry VIII. was distinguished by an uncom mon accession of property, which was as profusely distributed as it had been unjustly obtained; yet the firmness of Henry's character in Ireland appears evident by the general and in stant revolt which threatened the dawn of his successor's reign. Elective chiefs of Milesian race had been seduced or awed by Henry to accept the descendible rank of nobility, whereby paternal feelings superseded family pride, and a power derived from Brehon law or native customs was wisely directed to its complete subversion. Such, also, was the progressive strength of that principle, that the government of the young Prince, aided by those interested nobles, quickly enforced a general bedience. It also assumed another position worthy of notice, (\u00bb) Castleknock."], [68, "LX PREFACE. and which partook alike of the policy and justice of English law ; the Privy Council or Superior Courts encouraged the complaints and redressed the grievances of dependent Irish septs. This sagacious system rent asunder the link of Mile sian union, and enlisted, at no expense, inveterate enemies to its continuance. Persons acquainted with the habits, preju dices, and language of the inferior classes, were thereby in terested in exercising all their influence in exploding customs opposed to the common law. Religious disputes did not during this reign enforce any material deviation from existing law, or much inflame the civil disorders of the country ; but a new sovereign assumed the sceptre, whose policy and pre judices clashed with Edward's religious creed. All writers agree that so late as the age of Elizabeth, one half or three-fourths of Ireland had returned to pretty much the same state of civilization in government and language, in usages, religion, and laws, which at the landing of Henry II. prevailed over the whole of it. Elizabeth found the great body of the natives no longer suppliant for the ex tension of the English laws ; infuriated \"by the government of many preceding years, the}*, in common with some of the most eminent families of English descent, to whom they had been now allied by intermarriage and otherwise, had proffered their allegiance to foreign crowns ; under those circumstances the Queen, as appears by her records, endeavoured to reclaim those subjects of English descent who had withdrawn from the authority of her government, and to detach them from those alliances and connexions which seemed to threaten her authority. Need we wonder, therefore, that she partook of the feelings of some of her predecessors, and that on the escheat to the Crown of territories by forfeiture, her Majestv strictly prohibited. ) the regranting or subletting of any portion of those territories to the native Irish, whose existence by this time, as a people, seemed to her advisers almost incom patible with the maintenance of English government in the country. Even when granting estates in Ireland to subjects born in England, and whose attachment to her interest was (\u00bb) Commission for Plantation of Munster."], [69, "PREFACE. LXI undoubted, it became usual with the Queen to order the in- sertion of clauses in their patents, whereby it was provided, in case daughters succeeded to those estates, that such daughters should \" be bestowed in marriage to noe persons but to such only as be of English birthe for two descents successively to followe.\". ) Many of Elizabeth's grants are to be found cer- tainly, by which favours were conferred on the native chief- tains ; but some of those grants conveyed the chieftaincy and estates to junior, or spurious members of the sept, in opposition to the then acknowledged chief; others conveyed the estates of the whole sept to the chieftain, and to the heirs male of his body, though only deriving from the sept, according to their laws, the usual life interest in such estate ; and most of the other seeming instances of royal favour evidently proceeded from similar motives, namely, the creation of internal dissen- sions amongst the septs, and the total annihilation of that spirit of clanship which had so long preserved the power and influence of the natives. To further these views, fortresses were also erected, or newly munitioned, and largely endowed with landed estates for their maintenance ; many of those were garrisoned with governors and military companies on the no- mination of the Crown (pp. 4, 36, 65, 151, 465), and even at the present day, some of those fortresses, with their original endowments, exist ; while several of them were granted to experienced English officers, and their heirs male, with a cautious clause, that during the minority of such heirs male, the government of Ireland should have power to appoint a sufficient military guard for defence of the castles and estates, and that the minor should be chargeable with the expenses of \" ten hable soldiers \" for that purpose. Many- other of the State measures of Elizabeth's reign evince an equal tendency to a revival in Ireland of that feudal spirit which had so rapidly declined in England. Force was abso lutely necessary ; but the idea of a regular standing army w -as little understood, and, therefore, recourse was had to a rigorous revival of that ancient system of military* government under which a footing had been first made in the country, and which <\u00bb) Rot. Mem. 24\u00b0, 25\u00b0, 26 , Elizabeth."], [70, "LXII PREFACE. there, as in Scotland, had not yet entirely fallen into disuse. Amidst such arrangements the nobility were not forgotten ; for when the Queen, to effect an increase of her revenue, appointed Commissioners for disposing of the wardship and marriage of her tenants in capite, she specially reserved for her own disposal the wardship and right of giving in marriage of all her barons and other superior peers in Ire land ; and a Statute was passed in the eleventh year of her reign, whereby it was made treason for the Irish to nurse or foster the children of her Irish nobility. By this means she retained a considerable check on further alliances with the natives; and seeing the numerous intermarriages that had taken place before her time between them and her nobles, and the consequent possibility of large districts vesting through females in declared enemies, or at least doubtful subjects, her Majesty fully sanctioned the ancient usage of limiting their estates and dignities to heirs male. Though legal materials of most extensive import, and in uncommon variety, occur in the reign of Elizabeth, the lead ing maxim of her long and successful reign was to enforce, with steady aim and persevering counsels, every measure which tended to extend or confirm a complete model of the English constitution, with the full benefit of the common law in this island. The confiscation of the southern counties presented a new and unexampled precedent, which a perfect knowledge of English law, unsupported by the imperfections of Irish prac tice, would disable an honest man from carrying into effect. Thus, the election of an Irish chieftain was not allowed to have any weight in Irish Courts against the descendible quality of fee-simple estates ; yet the treason of such chief was considered conclusive proof of a right sufficient to defeat all derivative interests, and vest the property, w-ithout office or inquisition, in the Crown ; living within a rebellious district was evidence sufficient to constitute the guilt of treason against the party so circumstanced, and enforce from him proof of active loyalty. Being slain, flagrante hello, was deemed rebellion, and constituted an immediate attainder, in which instance"], [71, "lxiii PREFACE. the heir was irrevocably bound, and could not success fully support his right by showing that his ancestor, acted under compulsion, or suffered by martial law. These con fiscations, anomalous to common law, were, however, en forced by the rapacity of the administration and the cor ruption of the judges. The boundaries and claims of church lands, and the possessions of the monasteries, also afforded an extensive field for litigation and doubt ; add to these the con tradictory grants of the Crown, with the artful and fraudulent claims of existing and reversionary patentees ; such a state scarce needed the additional abuse of that ancient prerogative which presumes all landed property to flow directly from the Crown, and throws the necessity of showing a title on the possessor. The legal harvest afforded ample room for pro fessional discussion in arranging the conflicting rights of complaining natives, rapacious courtiers, and intriguing adventurers. Such was the actual state of Ireland during the period embraced by this volume. The successful rebellion in the north had nearly reduced the kingdom to the lowest depths of misery, anarchy, and confusion. Elizabeth herself says, \" she is sick at heart, and knows not what to project ; the very mention of the subject makes her sick and ill.\" The province of Connaught had been divided into six counties \u2014 Galway, Sligo, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, and Clare, which last county included Tho mond ; but no justices of assizes were yet sent to those coun ties. Though the province of Ulster came to the Crown so far back as Edward IV., through his marriage with the heiress of De Mortimer, and by the subsequent Statute of the 11\u00b0 of Elizabeth, no actual possession was taken. The Irish still possessed their lands by the strong hand ; and, as we are informed by the Inquisitions, finding the title of the Crown to those northern counties, the abbey lands called Termon, or Herenagh, were possessed by the clergy ; the Bishops -of Clogher, Derry, and Raphoe, were still nominated by the Pope, and \"the Archbishop in his own diocese, the Bishop of Clogher and the Bishop of Derry, from time to time, until the"], [72, "LXIV PREFACE. arrival of the Pope's bull severally collated to every void parsonage, and the party so inducted remained in the bene fice till the bringing of the bull\"\u2014 (p. 134, note.) Sir John Perrott, shortly after his appointment to the office of President of Munster, suppressed the rebellion which broke out in that province; and now the Plantation (p. 172) had become a favourite scheme, projected by Sir Thomas Smith, Secretary to the Queen, to provide for his son in Ireland, when the attempt was suddenly defeated by the assassination of Smith by the treachery of O'Neill. Devereux, Earl of Ulster, attempted to plant another district in Ulster with English settlers ; impediments were interposed by the jealousy of Fitz- William; his associates repented of their engagement, and withdrew to England. In the meantime, Sir Peter Carew reclaimed MacMurchad ; the sons of Clanrickard were reduced to submission and pardoned, and Desmond was obliged to renew his proffers of allegiance, which afforded Essex an opportunity to resume hostilities in Ulster; various circum stances conspired to defeat his operations, and he died a victim to vexation and disappointment. Sir Henry Sidney succeeded Sir W. FitzWilliam in the government of Ireland. He appointed Sir William Drury, President of Munster, where he held his courts. He adminis tered justice impartially, enforced a strict observance of English manners, dress, and language ; and succeeded in introducing and executing the English laws within the liber ties of Desmond. Sir Nicholas Malby succeeded to the presidency of Con naught ; and her Majesty, by letter dated last of March, in the 21st year of her reign, instructed him to unite the county of Thomond to the government of Connaught, as it had been in the time of Sir Edward Fitton, and that Connaught should be restored to its ancient bounds (p. 19). And for a time the entire country wore an aspect of tranquillity, until the dis proportion between the revenue of the country and the charge of maintaining the English power, induced Sidney to conceive a project for converting the casual assessment or contribution into a perpetual \" composition,\" exacting it from"], [73, "LXV PREFACE. all without distinction. He proceeded to a general imposition of the new tax by authority of the Council, and by virtue of the Queen's prerogative. Ormond, Kildare, Gormanstown, Dunsany, and others of the Irish objected, and prayed that the imposition might be moderated; the Lords and Gentlemen of the Pale, adhering to their declaration, were committed to the Castle, and their agents in London to the Tower. Sidney subsequently was instructed to bring this affair to some speedy accommodation, and a composition was settled between the Council and the Lords of the Pale (p. 476). Sir William Drury (p. 23) succeeded Sidney, and after a protracted warfare with Desmond, committed the charge of the army to Sir Nicholas Malby, with instructions from Mr. Secretary Walsingham to unite the country of Thomond to the government of Connaught (p. 18) ; and he was proceeding to reduce the castles of Desmond, when the death of Drury determined his authority. Meanwhile the Irish Council ap pointed Sir William Pelhan, Governor (p. 27), until the Queen's pleasure should be known ; who prosecuting the expedition against Desmond and his adherents, reduced them to the last extremity, when he was recalled on the arrival of Lord Grey, his successor (p. 29).(a) The Earl of Ormond succeeded Lord Grey, in the year 1581 ; and as the insurrection was almost wholly extinguished, and Desmond killed in a skirmish, a pardon was offered to those who would come and ask the benefit of it. Grey was recalled. Loftus, Archbishop of Dublin, and Sir Henry Wallop, were appointed Lords Justices (p. 31), and the Queen (\u00bb\u2022 Spenser, the poet, accompanied Lord Grey as Secretary, and he has left us the following narrative of the consequences of his patron's adminis tration : \u2014 \" Notwithstanding the pro vince of Munster was a most plentiful country, full of corn and cattle, yet in one year and a-half they were brought to such wretchedness, as that any heart would rue the same ; out of every corner of the woods and glens they came weep ing forth upon their hands, for their legs could not bear them ; they looked like anatomies of death ; they spake like ghosts crying out of their graves; they did eat the dead carrions \u2014 happy when they could find them : yea, and one an other soon after, insomuch as the very carcases they spared not to scrape out of their graves ; and if they found a plot of water-cresses and shamrocks, there they flocked as to a feast for the time (yet not able to continue there withal), that in a short space there was none al most left, and a plentiful and populous country was suddenly left void of man and every living creature.\" And such was the tyranny practised by Lord Grey, that it was represented to the Queen. \" that little now was left her in Ireland to reign over but ashes and carcases.\" t"], [74, "LXVI PREFACE. sent them directions for the defence of the pale against the O'Moores and the O'Connors. The death of Desmond, and the extinction of the rebellion, threw into the hands of the Crown the vast tracts forfeited by Desmond and his adherents, and which were now to be parcelled out to new possessors ; for which purpose a commission of survey was to be appointed. In 1584 the government was committed to Sir John Perrott (page 72), and he appointed Sheriffs for the counties of Con naught, Clare, Galway, Sligo, Mayo, Roscommon, and Lei trim ; and Sir Richard Bingham was appointed Lord President of Connaught. The Ulster chieftains surrendered their pos sessions and received them again, subject to English tenures ; they consented to a composition whereby 1,100 soldiers might be maintained in that province without charge to the Queen ; and Perrott projected a division of the un-reformed parts of Ulster into seven new counties, Armagh, Monaghan, Tyrone, Coleraine, Donegal, Fermanagh, and Cavan, for each of which the Queen appointed Sheriffs, Commissioners of Peace, and Coroners. He issued a commission for establishing a com position in Connaught, in the place of assessments for the maintenance of troops, which the inhabitants readily granted ; every obstacle was removed to Perrott's scheme of repeo pling Munster with an English colony, and Sir Christopher Hatton, Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Thomas Norris, Sir Warham St. Leger, Sir George Bouchier, and others, received grants of large portions of land for the purposes of the plantation (p. 324). The De Burgos in Connaught insisting that no Sheriff should presume to enter their territory, and that they would be governed by a chieftain, as in ancient times, called forth the decision and energy of Bingham 's character. He caused the law to take its course with inflexible rigour ; the insurgents were pursued to their retreats, and Bingham, by a decisive and signal victory, extinguished, for that time, the rebellion in Connaught. Perrott, before his departure summoned a number of the Lords and Chieftains, and exhorted them to give sureties for their peaceful conduct by delivering hostages to the government; to which they consented. He then delivered"], [75, "lxvii PREFACE. the sword of state to his successor, Sir William FitzWilliam (p. 157), declaring that he left the kingdom in peace, and that he would engage to bring in any suspected leader, without violence or contest, on twenty days' notice. FitzWilliam arrived in Ireland on the 23rd June, 1588, and on the Sunday following in Christ Church, presented her Majesty's patent, which being read by the Master of the Rolls, he took the usual oath, on his knees, \" divers and sundry of the nobility being present\" (page 157). He parcelled the country of Tyrone into a shire, and divided it into baronies after the English model, and established a composition for purveyance in Munster for three years. \u25a0 Tyrone, who had for some time past, kept at a secure dis tance from the seat of government, at length presented him self before Sir William Russell. He was allowed to depart, contrary to the advice of Bagnal, and to the private opinion of Russell himself. It was not long, however, until Tyrone stirred up commotion again in the north, and Sir John Norris was despatched to subdue him. He was invested with supreme command in military affairs in the absence of the Lord Deputy. Tyrone managed to negotiate ; and so confident and plausible were the clamours and accusations against Bingham, that he was arrested, conveyed to England to answer those com plaints, where her Majesty, refusing to see him, sent him to the Fleet; and when Sir Conyers Clifton was appointed his successor, Bingham was obliged to return in custody (p. 472), and was actually tried in Athlone before Commissioners appointed for that special purpose ; but being acquitted, as it was evident her Majesty inclined most favourably towards him, he was again employed in her service. On the death of Norris, Lord Burgh commenced military operations against O'Neill, but his sudden death abruptly ter minated his career (p. 463), and the Council appointed the President of Munster, Sir Thomas Norris (p. 462), the imme diate successor of Sir John, Lord Deputy ; while to the Earl of Ormond was intrusted the military department (p. 484), with the title of Lord Lieutenant of the Army. On the defeat of Bagnall, the Queen at first selected Mountjoy to be Lord .2"], [76, "lxviii PREFACE. Deputy, but the favourite Essex objected \" that this lord had not sufficient experience in the art of war, and that his retired and studious life was ill-calculated for a career which demanded vigour and activity,\" and succeeded in obtaining the appointment of Lord Lieutenant for himself (p. 520), with more extensive power than almost any* Governor had enjoyed before him, besides the extraordinary power of restoring to all rebels and traitors their dignities, honours, titles, ranks, pre-eminences, of granting or demising forfeited territories, counties, and dominions, to hold to the grantees and the heirs male of their bodies ; and he, in common with his predecessors, possessed the power of summoning Parlia ment at his pleasure, without the sanction and even without the knowledge of the Queen ; he was authorized to pardon all treasons, even such as immediately affected the Queen's person ; and to remove officers, and to confer all dignities. He was left to conduct the war at his own discretion, and he was furnished with an army of 20,000 men \u2014 a force which was then considered irresistible. On the deaths of Sir Warham St. Leger and Sir Thomas Norris, Mountjoy was appointed Lord Deputy (p. 564),. ) Ormond was continued Lieutenant of the Army, and Sir George Carew was nominated President of Munster, that office being vacant since the death of Thomas Norris (p. 539). In a short period the greater part of Ireland, by continual wasting and spoiling, was reduced to a desert, and the insurgents, de prived of supplies at home, were compelled to depend upon assistance from abroad ; and this they were enabled to procure with the Queen's own treasure, a large portion of which fell into their hands. The expenditure of the war now amounted to nearly half a million a year; and it was ascertained that by the regular payment of the army in sterling money, a great quantity went into the hands of the Irish, either by inroads and plunder, or indirectly through commerce, and was used in procurino from the continent a regular supply of arms, ammunition, and (\u00bb) The history of Mountjoy 's govern- more at large the proceedings of the Lord ment has been handed down by his lord- President of Munster.

The Government resolved upon an extraordinary method for remedying this inconvenience. It was a total ex change of the sterling coin then used in Ireland for a base cur rency, the use of which was restricted to Ireland. A proclama tion (p. 578) was issued, establishing an exchange in several towns in England as well as in Ireland, where the subjects of either kingdom might commute their coins, allowing a differ ence of one shilling in the pound between the Irish and Eng lish standard. As this new coin passed at a nominal value much above its intrinsic worth, it was of little use in purchas ing provisions or ammunition in foreign countries, so that of course the new scheme reduced the rebels to greater distress than ever. But it was soon found that it had also incon veniences as great as the advantages expected to be derived from it. Merchants made it an excuse for raising the prices of all articles of commerce, and great sums of counterfeit money coined by rebels and strangers were thrown into circulation ; \"so that,\" says Moryson, speaking in the name of the army, \" the exchange soon failed, and our hearts therewith ; for we served there in discomfort, and came home beggars; so that only the treasurers and paymasters, who were thereby in finitely enriched, had cause to bless the authors of this inven tion.\".) Connected with the proposed reforms at this time, was the establishment of an university in Ireland (p. 227). In the reign of Edward III. two successive archbishops suggested a scheme for establishing a university. The first was projected by John Leech, Archbishop of Dublin, in 1311 ; and Archbishop Bicknor, in year 1320, founded, under the Papal (a) On the Plea Roll of the 27\u00b0 Edward 1. are placita parliameiita and communia placila.

The endowment was enlarged by Edward the Third, who by writ granted protection and safe conduct to the students. The institution languished for a few years amidst commotion and anarchy, and at length expired. Leland observes that the penetration of the founder was not equal to his zeal. But though Ireland at that period was no place for an university of arts, science, and literature, the Bishop of Ossory showed himself skilled in the science of witchcraft and heresy. A woman and three men were brought before the Spiritual Court: three were burnt for heresy, and one died in prison. \" For though one of the charges against the woman could not be proved, at least clearly \u2014 namely, witchcraft \u2014 yet, on a new accusation for heresy, she was condemned to the flames.\" At length the charge of heresy recoiled upon the bishop himself. He was obliged to fly, making an ineffectual appeal to the apostolic see. The project for an university was not entirely forgotten, and still retained its name \u2014 at least, so late as the reign of Henry VII. An Irish Parliament had, in the year 1465, 1\u00b0 Edward IV., passed a statute that an university should be established in Drogheda,(a) with the same liberties and privi leges as were enjoyed by Oxford, but this, like similar Irish Acts, was forgotten in the tumult of the period.O.

The Irish students who resorted to England for education, though ex pressly excepted in the Act, were excluded from the Inns of Court ; thus they were denied access to the laws by which they were in future to be reclaimed and governed.

Finally, Sir John Perrot projected two universities, to be erected in Dublin, out of the Cathedral of St. Patrick, which he recommended to be dissolved. But this scheme was opposed by Loftus, Archbi- shop of Dublin, who was interested in the livings of the church by leases which had been procured for himself and his kins- men (p. 563). On the recall of Perrot, Loftus, to make some amends to the interests of learning and religion, fixed his eye upon part of the estate of the city of Dublin.

The corporation generously and immediately granted the monastery, with its precincts and possessions (p. 346), and her Majesty granted a royal charter of incorporation on the 3rd March, 1595, with licence to take that or any other gift it might obtain not exceeding the annual value of \u00a3400.

The increase of English power during her Majesty's reign appears from the subdued tone of the Irish chieftains in their submissions ; and in December, 1602, (a) the Queen despatched an order to the Lord Deputy Mountjoy, to grant a general pardon to all the inhabitants of Munster of what condition or state soever, to remove them from all suspicion of impeach ment for their former offences, \"whereunto,\" adds her Majesty, \" the greatest part of them have been violently carried rather by the power of the arch-traitors (whom she excepts from pardon) than by any wilful defection in their loyalty*.

It hath been heretofore most graciously accepted and recom pensed. Your Lordship hath, by your words and writing, vouchsafed to testify it to my comfort, and Mr. Strafford, here present, that hath worthily governed her Majesty's forces in Claneboy, by your Lordship's noble directions, I doubt not will report it; but my gracious good Lord, I am not now to plead it, sith the late unfortunate act committed by my men, in killing of Hugh Oge, hath de faced the reputation of it. I am heartily sorry for that ill fact so by them com mitted, he being, upon the Governor's direction, to come unto your honour ; yet, sith he was so casually met with and killed by my followers, whose men and kinsmen he had killed before, and also my brother, who was fostered by the chief nation under me, and the memory of my brother's blood, their fosterer, and their own kinsmen's death, did revive and stir in them such a natural passion on the sudden, as did overcome the fear of God, her Majesty's laws, and their reason; I humbly pray that my sorrowful repentance may be some satisfaction for that rash, unadvised fact, happening through natural frailty, committed by my men, and not done of malicious purpose, I coming with as much speed as may be to appease the matter, but could not prevail, they being so maliciously bent for revenge ; and that, therefore, your Lordship, of your accustomed goodness, mitigating the rigour of the law, will vouchsafe to extend her Majesty's mercy upon me, that do here upon my knees, as well of my heart as of my body, hum bly and lamentably beg the same, be seeching God to bless and preserve her Majesty's royal estate, and to grant your Lordship a continuance with increase of happiness in government, which causeth me and all others thus humbly to submit and prostrate ourselves at your feet.

Amongst many others in that case, I may and do reckon myself for none of the least ; for being a man born out of this realm, and gotten large possessions in the same, whereupon I lived, though I might claim none by inheritance, I have very incon- siderately presumed to think I might as well hold it as I got it, by the strong hand. Carried on with this imagina- tion, as one ignorant of her Majesty's might and force, and withaL ill- persuaded by others, I unhappily refused to come in to your Lordship as the rest of Ulster did, almost now two years past, thinking it might suffice for me, upon your Lord- ship's repair into those parts, to write a letter of some kind of observance unto you, with an offer, after a sort, to come myself also upon such capitulations as now, to my smart, I find were unmeet for me to make. But your Lordship having no mind, as it hath well appeared, to make advantage of my rash oversight, vouchsafed to license the Earl of Tyrone and Sir Edward More to send unto me such gracious conditions as I grieve to think that I refused them, and with the unadvised letter I writ to your Lordship, the haughty words I uttered, and the indiscreet demands I then made (to have men of far better sort than myself to be in pledge for me), were buried up in for- getfulness. I condemn my folly in leav- ing such men in the castle of Dunluce, within this her Highness' land as should say ; they kept it in the name and to the use of the King of Scots, a prince that honoureth her Majesty and em- braceth her favour. I sorrow for my perseverance in that purpose, whereby I have unjustly drawn her Majesty's force and whet her Highness' sword against me, which hath slain my son and most of my people, spoiled me of my goods, and left me with a few distressed, being in no way able to stand against her Majesty's force ; wherefore I do prostrate myself at the feet of her Majesty's cle mency, submitting myself wholly there- unto, and most humbly praying to be restored only thereby, through her noble favour, that is accustomed as well to pity the humble as to suppress the proud Submission of Sorlie M'Do-Tnell. \u2014 Most honourable Governor, it is and may be truly said, there is no unhappiness"], [83, "LXXV PREFACE.

The Irish customs of tanistry and gavelkind were now abolished by judgment in the King's Bench, and the Irish estates made descendible according to the course of the English common law. The Brehon law was entirely abro gated, and the English law substituted in its place w*as gradu ally made more palatable to the Irish by the fair and impartial manner in which it was administered. The occasional introduction of some detached and gene rally unimportant instruments relative to Ireland into the F\u0153dera, is much to be regretted, as it must tend to an erroneous impression, that the edition embraces all necessary documents relating to that country, and may hereafter pre vent the publication of a regular series of State Records or Acta Regia for Ireland. Such a collection would be of con- siderable importance, for the following reasons: \u2014 Some of the earliest and most authentic expositions or declarations that we now have of the ancient common law of England, are principally to be gathered from state documents issued for Ireland; most of the public events, transactions, and negotiations, in which the English kings were engaged at agreeable satisfaction she could receive for the mischiefs fallen on her loving subjects by his iniquities, she conceived the most ready means for effecting the same, was to draw from him the chief Captains of countries ; to which purpose her pleasure was, that the Lord Deputy should receive to her mercy such of them as truly and humbly sought it, without prescribing hka any particular course. who best knew all circumstances, only she gave this caution, to provide against former mischiefs \u2014 that whereas, com monly the rebels, fearing to be spoiled, were wont to contract underhand with the arch-traitor to submit themselves, thereby, for the present, to save their country, and to give succours to the re bels ' creights ' underhand, and after the return of the army to revolt again ; now, he should consider the motives of their craving mercy, and where he could not ruin them without spending more time and charge than the main action would permit, then to deal with them in a more easy manner, otherwise to give more sharp impositions in the conditions of their submissions, and by wasting their goods to make their obedience more durable. That she judged one condition necessary \u2014 not to pardon any but upon service done, not only upon those whom particularly they hated, but upon any other as they should be directed. That as an argument of her confidence in him. she gave him power of war and peace, only one thing she professed to see no cause to leave unexempted, namely, the pardoning of the arch-traitor, a monster of ingratitude to her, and the root of misery to her people, thinking all other mercy than the proscription of him to all manner of prosecution merely incom patible with her justice, and, therefore, commanding not to receive him upon any conditions but upon simple submission to mercy for all things (life only excepted), and to make this, her pleasure, known to all his accomplices, persuaded by him that he may be pardoned at his pleasure, and so fearing to leave him, lest after they should be left to his superiority and revenge.\""], [85, "lxxvii PREFACE. home or with foreign powers, are detailed in writs and other records also transmitted to that country; and during the reigns of John and his immediate successors, the records bearing on Ireland disclose many essential data as to its history, and of public rights generally in both countries. Now, few of the records alluded to appear in the last edition of Rymer, and until they are published, we must lament the want of such valuable information. Laws and rights well known and observed formerly in England were not recorded, unless under particular or perbaps accidental circumstances ; but when such were transmitted for execution or observance to a distant kingdom, they were, of necessity, committed to writing, and preserved by registration for posterity, therefore no inquiry into the baronial or legislative history of England can be satisfactorily completed, without examination of all the records relating to Ireland previous to the middle or end of the fourteenth century. Whenever the Acta Regia for Ireland may be undertaken, it is hoped its execution will be intrusted to intelligent officers conversant with the subject of which they treat, and each of whom should have full credit for his individual labours ; by this means, and by ex cluding all modern and erroneous copies of records as authorities, where originals could be found, with due atten tion to the orthography of proper names, such officers pos sessing the necessary qualifications, would have every motive to produce a creditable public collection. The period embraced by this volume, namely, from the 18th to the 45th of Elizabeth, will be found pregnant with interesting and valuable information, and is, perhaps, the most eventful in the stirring period of her Majesty's reign. Many of the documents on those Rolls will be found of curious import, particularly those relating to the \" Composi tion,\" a proceeding with which our historical writers appear to have been little acquainted. Not, however, to the student of Irish history alone is the study of those records profitable. The lawyer cannot glance at their contents without forcibly contrasting the regal power"], [86, "lxxviii PREFACE. then enjoyed with that which is now left to the sovereign of these realms after the many conflicts between the people and the crown. The information afforded by those records is no less varied than important. They serve as a storehouse of facts and documents for the use of the statesman, the lawyer, and the antiquary ; nor will they be found, I trust, unworthy the regard of the scholar and the historian. To point out the nature of those MSS., to give a precis of their nature and contents, and to indicate where the record is to be found, is the object of this work. In vain we search among the pages of the historian for the interesting details they supply ; they illustrate the condition of the people, the growth of the constitution, the operation of the law, and the tenure and descent of property, real and personal \u2014 trustworthy and deserving of notice by those who desire to know the early history of their own country. The topographer and historian will find here a harvest of authentic information, which to them must prove invaluable. It was usual to embody in the charter, when it conveyed manors, castles, or landed property, a description of the pre mises so granted, the limits being described by metes and boundaries, with such precision as to afford identification at a remote period. The advantage of having complete calendars to public records, seems in itself so obvious that it becomes matter of some surprise to observe how frequently their importance has been undervalued ; some barely and coldly recommend them as useful, others consider the want of them as of little or no inconvenience, and some others, which is still more to be regretted, seem totally unapprized of their value or use. It is to be hoped, however, that those errors, whether of opinion or practice, and which ignorance or prejudice may have occa sioned, will soon be dissipated. A ready access to public records must, undoubtedly, be viewed as a matter of the highest importance, and, in proportion to its importance, it must be regretted that such ready access is not at present afforded in many of our record repositories. The records are"], [87, "lxxix PREFACE. the people's evidences ; and by a Parliament of 46\u00b0 Edward III., it was ordained that they should be accessible to all the king's subjects.

upon your imparting those orders to the Lord Justice of that realm, he and you shall resolve upon some means how to draw the mayor and inhabitants of Limerick to consent thereto, either by parliament or otherwise, at least for a time, till some apt place in Thomond may, at the country charges, be circuited with a wall, which we think not hard to be brought to pass in this peace able time, wherein we are contented that the labourers reserved to us in the compositions be employed, and we refer to you the choice of the place, which we conceive may fitly be at Quyne, Killaloe, or Innis, if Clare be not ours, but granted to the Earl of Thomond as we are informed.\" \" Further it is to be wished that in every county of Connaught where there are not already apt and safe places for the keeping of the assizes and sessions, that the countie at their charges be induced by good persuasion, and not by constraint, to circuit a convenient place, apt for a town, with a wall of lime and stone, which place we are content to incorporate with such liberties to draw inhabitants to it, as to other corporations of like situation within that realm have been granted ; for passing of which grant this shall be sufficient warrant to the Governor for the time being ; which our determination and desire to have these places of strength builded, we will you in our name to signify to all those under your government, so as every county perform one work in the same, judging that the aptest place be at Sligo, for the county of Sligo, at Bures for the county of Mayo, at Roscommon, for the county of Roscommon, and at Balleasloe, for the county of Galway.\" \" Whereas O'Conor Sligo, upon a wrong suggestion made unto us of the small circuit and dishability of his countrie, obtained of us a warrant for a grant to pass in Ireland for tbe freedom of his lands, in consideration of \u00a3100 Irish per annum, to be paid by him ;

Depositions of witnesses taken in Chancery the 7th of February, 1578, in the suit in the preceding article mentioned. \u2014 Sir John Plunkett, knight, Chief Justice of the Chief Bench, to the first inter rogatory deposes, \"that he remembers six several abbots, in the late abbey of Chanons, then called Saint Thomas Court, as Abbot Walsh being \"a quondam,\" then Abbot Brante being in esse, after him Abbot Mey, and after him Abbot Duff, in whose time the late abbey was dissolved, and all that while he never heard or knew any officer of the Corporation of Dublin to serve any process within the site or precinct of the late abbey. His cause of knowledge is, that he attended upon his master, the Chancellor Fitzsimons, of Saint Patrick's, with his strollers singing \"balletes\" in the Abbot Brant's chamber, and afterwards attended upon Delahyde, the Justice of the Common Place, sundry times dining with Brante, and as he remem bereth, likewise with Holler, and being attorney in the Common Place two or three years, was well acquainted with Robert Houth, then one of the officers of the Exchequer, who had his lodging, meat, and drink, in the abbey, and did not suffer any officers of the Corporation to enter within the precinct of the abbey ; and heard in the time of Sir William Brabazon, and after his death, challange made by the Corporation, but what followed he knew not ; and this declaration he makes, by virtue of the Right Honourable the Lord Chancellor, his letter, in furtherance of justice.\" Sir Thomas Cries, Chanter of Saint Patrick's, deposes that \"the site and precinct of Thomas Court is and hath been, time out of mind, a place privileged, and without the rule, correction, and govern ment of the mayor, sheriff's, and commonsof Dublin; he saith also there had been controversy between the mayor of Dublin and the abbot of Thomas Court, which was Abbot Holler, about a house wherein one William Devonishe dwelled, which house the mayor affirmed to be without the Abbot's liberty; whereon they fell to suit ; but after wards, upon the determination of that controversy, he well remem bers that the Abbot established the house to be within his liberty, and he states that he knew the Vicars Chorals of Saint Patrick's, of whom he was then one, pay their \"pols\"tothe Abbot, his seneschal, divers times when he kept court at the barony of Donowre.\""], [147, "I583-] CHANCERY, IRELAND. 59 26 Elizabeth William Pigott, Sheriff of Dublin, also deposes to the privileges of Thomas Court ; and states his cause of knowledge to be that \"he saw one Hugh Crofton, deponent's man, killed by one Chicocke, upon the land of Thomas Court, and that he saw Barnaby Kinge, 8eueschall (to) Master Brabazon, keeping a coroner's \"queaste\" there upon the death of Crofton ; he does not know what privileges the house claimed as sanctuary, but the liberties extended to a house late in the tenure of John Healye.\" Peter Kell deposes \"that the house of Thomas Courte, with all the lodgings within the walls, and tbe forestreet houses in Thomas-street were, as long as he remembers, places privileged, and without the correction of the city. He had friends in the abbey in Abbot Duff's time, and was often \"using\" the house; and remembers that upon the killing of a man in Abbot Duff's time, a little before the casting of the house, there was a gallows set up at the wood side, and two persons were hanged there, who murdered P.ichard Marten and another, whose names he cannot remember ; and the queste that went upon their deaths was called within Thomas Court, and they were judged there, and hanged after the suppression by Sir William Bra bazon ; and at that time Barnabe King was seneschall of the court of the glebe. He knows not what privileges the house had before its dissolution, but he remembers that persons who committed great faults fled to the abbey and there remained, and none could take them away. The Abbot Duff, before the casting of the abbey, had a sergeant for the liberty, who \" reared\" all the rents off the tenants in Thomas-street and the Combe, and reared \" gadges\" of them for fines, for frays, battery, bloodshed, and other offences, committed in the liberty ; deponent reared both watch, hens, customs, and other fines, that were put upon the tenants by order of the court which was kept within the liberty.\" Bartholomew Russell deposes that Thomas Court was a liberty in itself, without the rule and correction of the city, as Christ Church and Saint Mary's had been ; his cause of knowledge is that he has known contention, ever since he was an officer in the King's Bench, between the citizens and those that had possession of Thomas Court, and he recollects having seen several indictments in his office, by the tenants of Thomas Court against the citizens, for trespass done within the liberty. Walter Broderepe saith, that when he was servant to Sir William FitzWilliams, at the time he was treasurer, dwelling at Thomas Court, there were certain felons who had committed a robbery upon one Patrick Malone, a merchant of the city, and came to one Hering's house, within the liberty ; and Master Patrick Gough and James Bedlewe, being sheriffs, having notice of the felons being there, came there, and would have had them away; and deponent resisted and kept them there twenty-four hours, and then sent them to the castle, where thev were tried and executed. He also saith. that the liber ties extend eastward to a post within the house wherein John Healie lately dwelled, westwards, round about the church within the manor, and southwards as far as Donower."], [148, "PATENT AND CLOSE ROLLS, [1583. 60 26 Elizabeth [Award between the mayor, bailiffs, and commons of the City of Dublin and tire Abbot of Saint Thomas Court, relative to a certain custom called the \" Tolboll:\" \u2014 \" This award and ordynance indentyd made the vii'h day of De cember the xvith yer of the reyng of Kyng Henri the viiith, wyttenissith that ivheras ther was certayn warience and debates long dependyng betwix Nicholas Queytrot late mayr of the cittie of Dublin, Bertheleme Blanchewill and John Candell then beyng b dliues of the sayd cittie^ and the commonis of the same of the one party, and Thomas, Abbot of the house of Seynt Thomas the Martyr besydis Dublin and his convent of the same, of the other party, as consernyng a certayn custom callyt : Tolboll,' wherapon the sayd Thomas, Abbot, the furst day of August, tlie yer aforsayd dyd put a bill of compleynt ayens the forsayd mayr and bedlywes befor Jamus Denton, Sir Rauff Egerton, knyght. and Antony fitz Herbard, one of the justices of the Kynqis Commen Place in Ingland, then they beyng the Kyngis commyssioners in Irland, declaryng and supposyng by his sayd bill that wheras Kyng John, then beyng Kyng of Ingland, did yew and graunt and by his dede conferme to the Abbot of the house of Seynt Thomas aforsayd, and to his successores, and lo the chanonys ther doyng Godis dewyn service, such custom of ale and methe as the sayd Kyng John vsyd to haw and lewy in the taverens of Dublin, that ys to say, of every brew of ale or methe lo be sold in Dublin, one mesure callit the Tolboll (conteynyng in hit self a gallon and di :) (a) of the best ale and methe, and as mych of the secound, and how that the sayd Abbot and his predecessores was seysyd of the sayd custom callit Tolboll by reyson of the Kyngis graunt till they was lettyd and disturbit by the foresayd mayr and ballywes, as pleynly hit doth upper by the forsayd Abbottis bill of compleynt; by reyson wherof hit was ordirrit, jugyt, and decreyt by the forsayd commyssioners and the Kyngis Counsaill her in Irland, by the assent of the sayd.

That being so seized, he by letters patent granted said premises to James Butler, then Earl of Ormond, from whom the right thereto descended to the com plainant ; that this grant was confirmed by letters patent of Philip and Mary ; but that the Mayor, Bailiffs, Burgesses, and Commons of the town of Galway, in the province of Connaught, always gave impediment in taking said prize wines grown there, without any color of right, but pretending prescription. The defendants, by Anthony Lynch, Nicholas Lynche, John Skerritt, Domyuick Martin, Marcus Lynche, and Edmond French, made answer ; wherein amongst other things they stated that neither the plaintiff, nor any of bis ancestors, since the said grant of Edward III. \u25a0was seized of any prisage in the port of Galway, and that they and"], [189, "1585-] CHANCERY, IRELAND. 101 27 Elizabeth all others, bringing and discharging wines therein were free, and discharged of and from the same. As evidence hereof they adduced au acquittal, by the Privy Council of England in the time of Henry VIII. And also the charter of that monarch dated at West minster, the 3rd July, in the 360 of bis reign, that no person thereafter bringing wines in any ship or boat to the key or port of Galway, and there discharging the same, should pay prisage ; they further stated that in the reign of Edward I., a composition was entered into between that King and merchant strangers, whereby he, his heirs, and successors, were to receive two shillings encrease of custom out of every tun of wine, besides divers other encrease of customs, upon sundry other sorts of merchandize: in consideration of which the King granted that all merchant strangers, repairing to every port of his dominions should be free and discharged of any payment of prize wine, which encrease of customs were ever since paid accordingly, and the merchant strangers freed and discharged of prisage. To this the Earl replied amongst other things, that the said composition was made with merchant strangers only, and did not extend to Ireland, and that even if it did, it was determined, as well by the death of Edward I., as by the aforesaid grant of Edward III. As to the decree made by the Privy Council of England, he states it was only until better proof should appear; and as to the allegation that no prisage was paid by the defendants since the grant of Edward III., the same was detained by the forceable and uncivil dealings of the defendants who made and meant to make a commodity of their dwelling in a remote part. The defendants re joined, and amongst other things said that the grant of Edward III. was made after the release of prize wines to strangers, and therefore no more could pass than the prisage of the denizens of some other parts of Ireland and not of Galway. That at the time of the grant, said commission was in force, and when made was proclaimed through the King's dominions, being higher esteemed to redound to the general profit of both the realms of England and Ireland, and extending infra regnum et potestatem suam, stretched to Ireland as well as to England, the same being then equally under the government of Edward I., that merchant strangers still took the benefit thereof in England. As to the prisage of denizens they said that the corporation of Galway was time out of mind freed and dis charged thereof, paying six pence tonnage for every ton, which custom was granted to the corporation by Richard II. They then affirmed that prisage is of that nature that a subject may lawfully prescribe to be discharged thereof against the prince, and if not against the prince, yet against the complainant, being in respect of the prince a private person, prescription lieth, notwithstanding his estate to be an estate in tail, the reversion thereof unto the prince ; and that, the rather, as the payment thereof is more hurtful than beneficial unto her Majesty, for thereby trade with strangers is slackened to the great decay of her Majesty's import and other duties, which would grow unto her Majesty if strangers were not discouraged by claim and demand of the said prisage to resort"], [190, "PATENT AND CLOSE ROLLS, [1585- 102 27 Elizabeth, 28 Elizabeth, hither, as in truth late experience declareth many strangers to have been ; and as to their uncivil dealing, and that they meant to make a commodity of their dwelling in remote parts, they said that since the first erection of their corporation they have with willing minds and furtherance, planted and increased civility, embraced the liberty of the law, and abandoned the contrary. The Earl surreplied : the cause was heard for several days; on argument it was stated on his behalf, that the decree of the Star Chamber, together with the com position with strangers and prescription, beihg the material points of defence, were resolved by Sir Thomas Bromley, knight, Lord Chancellor of England, and Sir Gilbert Gerrard, knight, Master of the Rolls in England, who were directed By the Queen to decide thereon, to be no title for subjects or strangers to be discharged of the payment of prize wines, and this decision was openly showed in court under their bands, wherefore, and particularly as the prescrip tion whereby the defendants claimed their discharge, was at divers times interrupted by seisin and possession as appeared to the court by divers good matters, and especially by a livery made in the reign of Henry IV., to James Butler then Earl of Ormonde, whereby he was restored to all the prize wines of Ireland by these words : De prisa vinorum in omnibus portubus et locis marilimis Hiberni\u00e6, saving the whole prize wines of Corke, and ODe-balf the prize wines of Waterford only, which were granted to the said corporations long before the time of Edward III. ; \"It was therefore ordered and decreed that the Earl of Ormond and Ossory, as cousin and heir of James Butler, the first patentee in tail of the prize wines, should have and recover to him and the heirs male of the body of his grandfather, the Lord Peter Butler, against the Mayor, Bailiffs, and Commons of Galway, the prize wines of all ships, barks, and vessels, that should arrive at the port or haven of Galway, and there discharge their wines whether they should be the goods of denizens or of strangers, according to the words of the writ of limitation sent to the Lord Justice, in the twenty-ninth year of the reign of King Edward the Third, that is to say, of nine tons, one ton ; and so to twenty tons, but one ton ; and of twenty tons, two tons ; and that the Mayor and Bailiffs should pay the Earl twenty pounds for his costs of suit.\" \u2014 Feb. 12, 27\u00b0.

Touching the origin and difference of corbs and herenaghs, and of the termon lands of the county, the jurors say, that Donell M'Hugh O'Neale, King of Ireland, did long before any bishops were made in the kingdom of Ireland, give unto certain holy men, whom they called sancti patres, several portions of land, and a third part of all the tithes, to the end they should say prayers and bear a third part of the charge of repairing and maintaining the parish church, the other two-third parts being borne by the parson and vicar, to whom the rest of the tithes is yearly paid, and also for their own honour and sustentation ; and that afterwards the said holy men did give unto several septs, several proportions of the said lands, and placed one or more of them in every parish, and with all gave unto him a third part of the tithes of that parish, to hold both the land and the tithe for ever, according to the course of tanistry, free from all exactions, and for that cause the land was called termon, or free, and the tenant thereof sometimes called corb and sometimes herenagh ; and the corb or herenagh was to bear a third part of the charge in repairing and maintaining the parish church, and the said portion of land, and the third part of the tithes so continued free unto the corb or herenagh, for many years, until the Church of Rome established bishops in this kingdom and decreed that every corb or herenagh should give to the bishop (within whose diocese he lived) a yearly pension, more or less, according to his proportion out of his entire erenagh, consisting of the land and the third part of the tithes, and that thereunto the corbs and herenaghs submitted themselves, but held their herenagh free for ever, and could not be removed by any of the temporal or spiritual lords or other person whatsoever: and further, the jurors say, that the difference of termon, corb, and herenagh consists in this, that the termon is the name of the land, and all termon land is herenagh land, and hath all the privileges of herenagh land ; but all here nagh land hath not as ample privileges as the termon. \u2014 Inquisition, Lynnavady, Aug. 30, 7\u00b0 Jac.

That special regard be bad for reservation of tenures, in capite, upon new grants to be made in fee simple or fee farm, unless there shall come a special direction from her Majesty to the contrary, and cause therein expressed why tbe tenure should be changed.

That in the commission for letting and setting her Majesty's lands and wards, the Chief Baron of the Exchequer may be also of the quorum; for very small fines are now made to her Majesty's use, as she is informed.

Pleadings in a suit in Chancery between Oliver Sutton, of Richardstowne, in the county of Kildare, and Thomas Pinckstowne, of Ballekeppagbe, in the same county, concerning certain lands in the county of Kildare.

The Lords of the Council of England to the Lord Deputy and Council of Ireland, concerning the O'Farrals : \" Whereas you and the Council there did, by your letters in July the last year, give us to understand of a complaint made there of the chief of the O'Farrall Boyes country, that, contrary to an indenture made in the time of Sir Henry Sidney, on her Majesty's behalf, and the sept of the O'Farralls on the other part, O'Farrall Boy, the chief of his name, had procured of late time a grant by letters patent of divers lands specified in the indentures to him and his heirs, contrary to the true meaning of the indentures, whereby in your opinion the same might open a way to the rest of the Irishrie, never hereafter to be brought to the like conformity as they were reduced to by Sir Henry Sidney ; and, furthermore, because you had understanding that one Irriall O'Farrall, son of O'Farrall Boy, to whom the grant was made, to him and his heirs, contrary to the purpose of Sir Henry Sidney, repaired hither to procure some further strengthening of the patent, wherein, if he should prevail, many inconveniences might fall out, as you did write, for which purpose you required us to be a meane to stay the execution of the patent until the controversy might be further discussed, or else to remit the cause back again thither ; upon these your letters we did at first think to remit the decision and determination of the complaint of the sept of the O'Farralls, against O'Farrall Boy, to your Lordship and the Council to be heard and ordered, as we thought it most convenient in all such cases, but yet by the importunity of Irriall, son of O'Farrall Boy, desiring that some of the complainants might be commanded to come hither, or to send some one, authorized in their behalf, to inform us what they could say for the maintenance of the first indenture, and for the im pugning of the last grant by letters patent ; we did yield thereunto, and by our letters, after long time spent, by reason of many other causes iucident, we wrote to your Lordship, requiring you to give knowledge to the O'Farralls who were complainants, that they should send some of their sept hither to declare just cause of their complaint, so as upon hearing both parties, we might make some determination for the appeasing of the controversy, and settling the country in good quietness ; whereupon, after long time, and many months past, there hither came with your letter, one Fergus O'Farrall, one of the principal of the sept of the O'Farralls, with vol. 11. 3"], [346, "258 PATENT AND CLOSE ROLLS, [1593- 35 Elizabeth, letters and supplications of a great number of tbe rest of the O'Farralls, subscribed with their hands, requiring to have their causes remitted to you, the Deputy and the Council, whereby the validity of their former indentures, their compositions with her Majesty, in the time of Sir Henry Sidney, and the validity of the new letters patent, might be indifferently there examined and ordered, as in like cases of controversy hath been usual ; whereunto, although we were much inclined, yet by the importunity of Irriall, son of O'Farrall Boye, who claimed to have the lands that belonged heretofore to the captain of the country, to him and bis heirs, con trary to the indenture, we did give hearing at sundry times, both to the complainants' allegations, making their titles by force of tbe former indentures, and also to tbe claim of Irriall, for his father, by tbe late letters patent, and after divers hearings, and view and con sideration had of the contents of the indenture of the letters patent, we resolved, according to our first determination, that it would be most convenient to command both parties to return to that realm ; and so we have given them charge, directing to have their titles there heard and discussed by you the Deputy and Council, or at least by the greater part of the Council to join with you for your assistance ; and for that purpose we require this cause and controversy may be heard and determined in such sort as the country may be best governed by justice and rules of law, and the people reduced to live and continue in their former obedience, which we are informed hath taken place in that country ever since the time of the former indentures, and quietly, or rather better than in any Irish country reduced to civil government within that realm ; and yet, notwithstanding this our determination to remit this cause to you, we cannot but impart to you the opinion we have conceived of both these claims, and how we would wish the final order might tend to the reducing of that country from all form of Irish government, and be ruled only by ordinary officers, accord ing to the course of the laws of the realm : for that purpose we declare unto you our opinion of the conditions of tbe first indenture, wherein we do dislike to have any one of the sept of the O'Farralls to have chief rule over all the rest, by the name of a Seneschal, as by the indenture was purposed, though be should be appointed by the Governor of the realm, only during the life of the party, for thereby the rest of the sept would be ruled much like to the Irish custom, for one to be chief over the whole, and an expectation would remain in the heart of the principal of the sept always to aspire to supreme government, not much differing from the Irish custom of Tani3try ; and upon consideration of the letters patent, we see cause more to dislike that he that is now O'Farrall Boy, should have his interest in all the lands, territories, customs, and services, that did belong to the Irish captainry, with courts leet, wardships, refections, and many other jurisdictions, to hold the same to him and his heirs, without any authority left to the governor of the realm to make charge thereof, and as by tbe indenture, which also We do dislike; was to be continued ; and therefore in our opinion both these"], [347, "1593-] CHANCERY, IRELAND. 259 35 Elizabeth claims being well considered, it were best for the Queen's service and the government of the country, that all Irish exactions and ser vices should be fully extinguished, and that the lands which belonged in former times, by the Irish custom, to the Captain, might be all first resumed to her Majesty, that grants might be made thereof to the principals of the sept ; foreseeing that O'Farrall Boy, who was the Irish captain, and was appointed by the indentures to be tbe Sen eschal, might have some greater portion of the lands to him and his heirs than the rest of his sept ; and the residue to be distributed to the principals of the O'Farralls who were parties to the indentures, and claim thereby to succeed O'Farrall Boy : to have the same in fee simple to them and their heirs, or their heirs male, with reservation of such services to her Majesty as in like cases have been reserved, whereby all parties might be the better satisfied with the extin guishing of the Irish captainry ; and in like manner we wish and think it expedient that all the other freeholders, who covenanted by the first indenture to surrender their lands, and to take them again of her Majesty, to them and their heirs, should be now ordered to perform the covenants of tbe indentures, and by these means the country should be best ordered for the quiet government of the people there, according to the order of the laws and extinguishing of all Irish customs and exactions ; and for the furtherance and perfecting of this our purpose, we think the parties who are at controversy ought, in good reason, to yield to this our opinion, for the imperfections are such, both in the indentures for lack of due execution of the same, aud in the letters patent also, because amongst divers provisions there is one specially that the letters patent should not be of any force to extinguish or change any cus toms, liberties, or powers reserved to her Majesty, her heirs or suc cessors, by the indenture made by Sir Henry Sidney ; and in some part also we think there is imperfection in the letters patent, for they have not been made to the O'Farrall Boy according to the form specially limited by the Act of Parliament made in that realm in the 12th year of her Majesty's reign, entitled \" an Act authorizing the Governor of the realm, by the advice of tbe Privy Council, and upon her: Majesty's pleasure, signified by instructions, to grant letters patent to the Irisbrie,\" according to which statute, if you shall find it necessary to have the grants made from her Majesty of the said country, you shall do well to signify your opinions in what sort her Majesty may direct you to make the said grants, according to the form of the statute, which we will willingly have sent to you from her Majesty; foreseeing that all things, and, namely, the \u00a3100 rent, granted to Sir Nicholas Malbye, be still reserved, as by the indenture was expressed ; and of your proceedings herein we require you to advertize us when time shall be convenient : and so we com mit you to God.

The custom is that every kinsman of O'Callaghan is to have a certain parcel of land to live upon, and yet no estate passeth thereby ; but the Lord, who is now Conoghor O'Callaghan, like his predecessors before, viz., O'Callaghan for the time being, time out of mind, may remove him to other lands, according to the custom ; and in that nature we find that O'Callaghan M'Dermody hath Rachaman, three ploughlands, and Gortengrosse, assigned him. Irrelaugh O'Callaghan is seized by the same custom as brother to O'Callaghan, of a ploughland in Kilecolman.

Partition and division of the territory in the preceding article mentioned. \u2014 The Commissioners state, \" that the matter in contro versy between Donell O'Swyllivan aud bis uncle, before the Lords of the Council, was, before their lordships, grown to a hearing, divers times debated and discussed, and upon full consideration of their titles to the territory in demand, it appeared to certain Com missioners to whom their honors committed the ' ripping up' of the cause, that her Highness had a better title to tbe contries than any of the parties ; nevertheless, her Majesty, of her bounty, was con tent they should have the same betwixt them ; thereupon the parties consented that a division should be made of all things de manded betwixt them ; and her Highness addressed her Commission under her Great Seal to us to divide and plot out, by certain limits, all the country of Beare, Bantry, and Ardea betwixt the parties, ac cording to tbe tenor of their lordships letter, dated the 5th of June, in the thirty-fifth year of her Majesty's reign, in the following terms: \u2014 \"After our bartie commendations to your lordship \u2014 whereas there hath been of long time a suit begonne and continued by Donell O'Swyllivan against his uncle, Sir Owen O'Swyllivan, of the Beare, for the title and possession of the country of Beare and Bantry, into which Donell hath alleged that bis uncle, Sir Owen, made first entry"], [384, "PATENT AND CLOSE ROLLS, [i594. 296 36 Elizabeth, thereunto after the death of Donell's father, being the elder brother of Sir Owen, and by that usurpation, according to an Irish custom .) continued the possession thereof divers years, until, by the abetment of M'Carthy More, now Earle of Clancare, bo came into England with M'Carthy, and procured him to surrender his estate to her Ma jesty, as though he bad good right thereunto, and soe obteyned upon that surmise, and by the favoure of M'Cartie More, at the time M'Cartie was made Earle, letters patent from her Majesty of that country; against which Sir Owen bath not only pleaded his patent, but also alleged that the possession of that country hath commonly come collaterallye to the uncles of the sons of the lyneal line of Donell. affirming for proof thereof, that there bath been in possession, besides himself, three that have been uncles to tbe children of the lyneal lyne, the which Donell alleged to have been by force, when the nephews of the lyneal line were within age; and that was also done by the supportation only of the Earl of Desmond, whereby tbe partie was called \" O'Swylevan Gyralduugh,\" and some of the rest were kept in possession forceably by the mainten ance of the M'Carties of Carbrie, and therefore were called \" O'Swyl livan Carbrye ;\" and so after divers allegations on either side, for maintenance of their title, Donell, making complaint against his uncle, was sent into Ireland to exhibit bis complaint there, where both parties might be heard before the Deputy and Council, and Sir Owen did appeare and made answer to the complaint and petition of his nephew ; and there was likely to have taken an end by plead iuge betwixt them, but Donell, doubting of some partial favor shewed by the Earl of Clancare, and others the M'Carties, neigh bours to that country, came hither into England, and by supplica tion to her Majesty, and to us of the Council, made earnest suit to have Sir Owen sent for over hither, to have tbe cause here beard and determined ; and in this case long time was spent before it came to any hearing, for we thought it mete to send for the plead ings that bad been in Ireland, which being brought over and perused, we found no ground to judge upon the antient title and right, for, by the pleadings, there did appear only tbe demands and allegations of the plaintiff, and the answer and denial of the defendant, for proof whereof there was nothing shewn by good warrant, either by evidence of writing or testimonies ; and, therefore, lacking the same, wo thought best, with the consent of the parties, that a Commis sion should be sent to the Vice-President and Council of Munster, as persons indifferent, to examine, by all good means, what proofs might be produced by either party for maintenance of their allegations.\" \"And to the end our intention should not be frustrated, we moved them to be bound in great sums of money, whereunto they would willingly assent, to obey the final sentence which we should o-ive upon the return of tbe Commission, and so they were dismissed to return into Ireland ;

And yet, nevertheless, for the better discussing of the varieties and contrarieties of the de ponents, we committed the perusal of the depositions to Sir John Popham, Chief Justice here of tbe King's Bench, Sir Thomas Norris, Vice-President, and Thomas Egerton, her Majesty's Attorney-General in England, and Roger Wilbraham, Solicitor in Ireland, who took great pains to peruse the depositions, and having both parties before them to be more fully informed of the state of their several titles, in conclusion, informed them that the Queen bad better title to those countries than either of them, though it bad been long discon tinued by the usurpation of the M'Carties, after the Irish manner, ami, upon consideration had of the proofs, it seemed very doubtful to which of them any title might be adjudged without scruple ; To that end they were content to submit themselves to such division of the lands between them as her Majesty and we should best like of, and to accept the same from her Majesty by her letters patent.\" \" And now, after this long declaration of the cause, how it hath been proceeded in, and continued here many years, we desire, briefly, to express our opinion and resolution in what sort the controversy may be determined, and either party provided with a convenient por tion of the country to be allotted unto them, which being plotted aud bounden out, may be hereafter, by her Majesty's letters patent, granted to either of them ; which resolution, touching tbe manner of dividing the country, we have reserved from the knowlege of tbe parties, until the same may be directly executed, without any quar relling of the parties or their friends. And for the partition of the countrie, we find fit that Donell O'Swillyvan, the plaintiff, is lyneallie descended in five descents from Dermot Ballogh O'Swillyvan Beare, who was quietly possessed of the castle of Beare, the haven, and a portion of the country round about, before any of the collateral hne usurped upon their nephewes in the lyneal line, and the more part of the children of the lyneal line from Dermod was, for tbe more part, in quiet possession of the castle and countrie adjoining.\" \" Therefore, we do think it agreeable with right, that the castle and such portion of land as hath been usually held by him who had the castle, should be allotted to Donell, and the other part of the country called Bantry, should be allotted to Sir Owen ; and that in this division of the country, the same may be as equally divided as the Commissioners shall think convenient ; saving that Phillip O'Swillyvan, brother to Sir Owen, and bis Tanist, may have al lotted unto him some portion in this division of the country called"], [386, "298 PATENT AND CLOSE ROLLS, [i594- 36 Elizabeth, Ardea, where the said Philip hath, as we be advertised, present possession ; and now that we have shewed our opinion of the manner of tbe partition to be made, and at good length declared the manner of our proceeding; wishing that the execution there of may be performed both speedily and quietly, that neither of the parties nor their friends might be made acquainted therewith, before it be executed, we require your Lordship to communicate, these our letters, to such of her Majesty's Council there, as shall be fit to give any advise thereon, and to acquaint the solicitor with the same, because he was both a Commissioner in Munster, and was used by us here about this matter ; and thereupon to send the double of these our letters to tbe Vice-President and Council is Munster, and to cause a Commission to be granted to tbe Vice- President and Council to proceed to the execution of this parti tion according to our advice, to whom we have also written our letters at this time to signify our desire that he would carefullie regard the execution of that Commission ; and yet, if you the Coun cil should find any just occasion to alter any part thereof, we leave it to your better consideration, and so, requiring you to advertize us of your proceedings, we bid you, heartily, farewell.\" \u2014 From the Court at Nonesuch, 5./1 of June, i5g$.

we have, therefore, accordingly divided and plotted to the said Donell, for his part and portion of the castles, territories, and tenements in controversie, the castle of Donboy, tbe castle of Beare haven, with the haven of Donboy or Bearebaven, and all the profits of fishings, customs, and duties, and all other certain and uncertaine profits thereof, with the demesne lands before specified, containing eight quarters and two ploughlands, and all other the demesne lands belonging to O'Swyly van, in the countrie of Beare, within the bounds hereafter expressed, together with the rents, services, lawful duties, and casualties whatsoever, due to O'Swylyvan, out of the freehold of the freeholders within the countrey of Beare, viz., Sleigh tffynnynduff, O'Linshighen, O'Holighan, O'Donegan, Sleight Dowlinge, Sleight Swleagwill, Dermod O'Swylivan, of Ballaghbuy ;

[This city appears to have been first incorporated as a distinct county in itself, by the Charter of Elizabeth, whereby she granted, that all the former lands and houses within the bounds of the city, as granted by King John, or any the succeeding Kings or Queens, should be a county of itself, as fully as was the city of Dublin, except the church and chancel of the Black Friars within the walls, and the place called Our Lady's Chapel. Waterford was, at a very early period, a place of considerable im portance, and had, from time to time, received numerous Charters, grant- ing it various liberties and privileges. Many of those Charters relate to a contest which ivas carried on for a great length of time, between Waterford and Ross, respecting a claim made by the former, that ships, entering the great port of Waterford, should load and unload at Waterford, to the exclusion of Ross. This privilege was granted and confirmed to Waterford by many Charters, and was, on the other hand, opposed and resisted by the men of Ross, with great zeal and perseverance, and sometimes with no little violence ; but it was at last abolished by a writ of i\u00b0 Richard II., A.D. 1377. In the reign of Richard the First, John, Lord of Ireland, granted Baliowodam to his almshouse of Saint John of Waterford, and protec- tion and certain privileges to the Brethren of Saint John of Water ford. King John, by charter, bearing date the yrd of July, in the seventh year of his reign, granted and confirmed to the citizens of his city of Waterford, residing ivithin the walls, his whole city of Waterford, with all its appurtenances ; and that the citizens should for ever have"], [395, "I595-] CHANCERY, IRELAND. 307 37 Elizabeth, their bounds as they were ascertained by the oaths of twelve men of the city, and of twelve men out of it, by virtue of the precept of King Henry, viz., \" his whole great port of Waterford, which enters between Rody boke and Ryndowane, even to Carrig, by water, and as the pill of Saint Katherine tends, as far as the bounds of Kilbary ; and from thence to the bounds of Cloncridane; and from these bounds to the bounds of Portficherie ;\" and that the citizens, their heirs, and successors, should have, for ever, all the liberties and free customs there written ; The first of these is, that all ships or vessels which should enter his great port of Waterford, between Rodybake and Ryndowane, should load and unload at the quay of Waterford, and nowhere else within the port, because this pertained to his dignity. This Charier is of considerable length, and grants to the citizens many privileges and immunities of the same nature as those granted about the same periods to other favoured cities, such as freedom from toll throughout his (the King's) territory, to hold pleas in the hundred of the city, to have the fines and amerciaments there, and to have all reasonable guilds as the Burgesses of the town of Bristol had, or were accustomed to have. Awrit of Henry III., in 1222, commandsthe Arch bishop of Dublin, Justiciary of Ireland, that henceforth he should not permit strangers, not residing in his cities or good towns of Ireland, to take places and messuages in the towns and cities, to the detriment of him and the towns ; and another writ of the same King, in the same year, commands the Justiciary not to permit ships to touch at the port of Ross, to the damage of him and of his town of Waterford, otherwise than as they were accustomed in the time of King John, his father, before the war waged behveen him and his Barons of England ; or to permit any to have freedom from toll or custom in the town or elsewhere by reason of lands which they should take and hold in the town of Waterford, unless they should be couchant and levant (cubantes et levantes) in the town, and contributing to lot and scot in common with the Burgesses there residing. \u2014 Gale, Appendix, Nos. VIII. and IX. Henry the yd, in the fourteenth year of his reign, issued a writ, addressed to the Archbishopi of Dublin, and his Justiciary of Ireland, commanding him that he should not permit any ship to touch at the port of Ross, in the county of Wexford, with merchandise, to the damage of the city of Waterford, otherwise than ships were accustomed to come to land there in the time of the Lord King John, his father, before the war waged between him and the Barons. \u2014 (Rot. Mem., 130 and 140 Edward II., m. 31, d.) Henry the 3rd, by charter, dated 16th day of June, in the 16th year of his reign, granted to the citizens, that they, and their heirs, should hold the city, with the appurtenances in fee-farm, by rendering 100 marks annually to the treasury, and that they, and their heirs, should have all the liberties and customs thereunder written, viz., that the citizens be quit of toll, lastage, pontage, and passage, and all other customs throughout the King's whole land and power, and if any per son, any where in his land or power, took toll of the men of the city, and should not restore it, after having been required so to do, the Provost of vol. ii. x 2"], [396, "308 PATENT AND CLOSE ROLLS, [i595- 37 Elizabeth, the city should thereupon, take pledges at Waterford, and distrain him to restore it, that no foreign merchant should buy, within the city, of a stranger, corn, hides, or wool, unless of the citizens, and that no stranger should- keep a wine tavern, unless in a ship, with this liberty reserved to the King, that from each ship which should hapypen to come there with wine, his bailiff, in his place, (the Provost of the city being present!), should choose ttvo casks of wine, whichsoever he would in the ship scilicet, one before the mast, and the other behind the mast, for the King's service, and should take nothing more, unless at the pleasure of the merchant. With regard to one of these casks of wine, there appears to have been a grant by the king, the record of which, is now so obliterated, that the object of it is not discoverable. It is further granted, that no foreign merchant should delay in the town with his merchandise for sale, ex cept for forty days, unless with the consent of the citizens ; and that the citizens might have all their reasonable guilds in like manner as the Burgesses of Bristol had, or were accustomed to have. The King also granted them all tenures within the walls and without, even to the right bounds of the city, in messuages, in buildings, and by water, and else where, in the town ; To be held in free burgage, to wit, by the service of the landgable, which they rendered within the walls ; and that each of them might improve themselves, as far as they could, in making build ings wheresoever they would upon the bank, without the damage of the citizens or town ; and that they might have and prossess all lands and vacant places, within the bounds, for building, according to their plea sure ; To have and to hold in fee-farm for ioo marks. There is extant a close ivrit of Edward, eldest son of Henry III., in the fifty -first year of Henry III., directed to his Justiciary or Lieu tenant, commanding them to hold an inquisition respecting certain complaints made by the citizens of Waterford, against the Burgesses and Men of Ross, for carrying off, by force and arms, to the port of Ross, ships coming to Waterford, and that they should cause to be remedied, those things which they should find requiring correction. Accordingly, on the same roll, it appears that an inquisition was held at Waterford, on the Saturday next before the Feast of Saint Nicholas, 51\u00b0 Henry III. \u2014 (Rot. Mem. 13\u00b0 and 140 Edward II., m. 31, d.), by which the jurors found, that after the conquest of Ireland, every ship coming from any land whatsoever, except from the land or liberty of the Earl Mareschal, Lord of Leinster, or his heirs, after it came to the entrance of the port of Waterford, according to accustomed usage, touched at Wcderford, and not at Ross, until the Burgesses of Ross, ivith an armed force, carried off certain vessels coming to that port, and wishing to have landed at Waterford; wherefore, the jurors found that the Burgesses of Ross, with force, carried off more than 40 ships, from each of which the King or the Lord Edward, ought to have had two casks of wine for 40s., in respect of prisage. After detading several other matters, the jurors found that, unless correction be applied to those transgressions, the town of Waterford, within a short time, would be abandoned by men, so that the Lord Edward would be deprived of his revenue coming from that city. There is a Charter, supposed to have been granted in the 28th year"], [397, "I595-] CHANCERY, IRELAND. 309 of the reign of Edward I. (Plea Roll, 280 Edward I., m. 12, d., 37 Tower), by which the Hospital of Saint John without the walls, near Elizabeth, the southern bridge, granted to Audoen, son of Thomas, the town which is called Ballyookyn, and the town which is called Mailhoh; To hold of them and their successors, at a rent of 2_. of silver, retaining the ecclesiastical benefices, and 12 acres for their own use. On the Close Roll of the 510 Edward III., a. 46, is a writ to the Mayor, Bailiffs, and Commonalty ; after reciting that the King had granted lo them his custom, called the \" cocket,\" for 10 years, and that at the time of his grant, it was his intention, that they should repair the quays of the city, and make a firm enclosure about the same, against the weapons and stratagems of his enemies, he enjoined and com manded them, that with all haste his city should be firmly enclosed, and the quay so repaired, that no loss should befall the city from a des >ct of its enclosure, or reparation of the quay. The following statute is of record, confirming the privileges granted to the Ostmen of Waterford: \u2014 \"Edward, by the grace of God, King of England, Lord of Ireland, and Duke of Acquitaine, to his Justice of Ireland, and all other his bailiffs and faithful subjects to whom the present letter shall come ; greeting : Inasmuch as by inspection of the Charter of the Lord King Henry, son of the Empress, formerly Lord of Ireland, our ancestor, it appears to us that our Ostmen of Water- J'ord ought to have the law of the English in Ireland, and, according to that law, be judged and brought lo trial ; We command you that you cause Gillechrist Macgillemory, William and John Macgille mory, and the other Ostmen of the city and county of Waterford, who derive their origin from the aforementioned Ostmen of the Lord Henry, our ancestor, to have the law of the English in those jiarts, according lo the tenor of the aforesaid Charter, and them to be conveyed according to that law, as far as in your power, until we shall introduce some other to be ordained according to our Counsel ; Witness myself at Acton Burnell, 5th of Oct., n\u00b0 of our reign. On the Statute Roll of the yd of Edward IV., is an Act which, re citing a former Statute, 380 Henry VI., providing that the grosse (groat), the denier, the demidenier, and the quadrant, should be struck within the castles of Trim and Dublin, enacts : \"Now as the mayor, bailiffs, and commons if Waterford are encumbered for want of small coins for change of greater, it is enacted, at their petition, that the above-mentioned small coins be struck at Waterford, in a place called Dondory, alias Reynold's Tower ; and that they be made of the same weight, print, and size as is mentioned in the said Act, to be done in the castles of Dublin and Trim, and that they shall have this scripture \u2014 \" Civitas Waterford.\" On the Statute Roll of the 8th Henry VII., is an Act repealing all Acts in prejudice of the mayor, bailiff's, and commons of Waterford, from 1st Nov., 1\u00b0 Henry VII., to the present dale ; and a full confir mation of all former grants, privileges, and liberties, especially the right of the delivery of the King's gaol, cocket, poundage, and the an nual rent of \u00a330,/. om the fee farm of the city, to the mayor, bailiffs. and commons."], [398, "PATENT AND CLOSE ROLLS, [i595. 310 37 Elizabeth.

(Michaelmas, 50 James I.) an infor mation in \"quo warranto\" was exhibited in the King's Bench against the Mayor, Sheriffs, and Citizens of Waterford, for having received the great and petty customs, and the subsidy of poundage of all merchan dise imported and exported into and out of the port, and for having. appointed a Customer, a Collector of Customs, a Controller of Customs. a Searcher, and a Gauger in the port. They pleaded the Charier of the ninth of King John, granting murage as in Bristol; (averring that the Burgesses of Bristol, at the time of the grant, had the custom of murage of all things and merchandise bought and sold within the town of Bristol) ; the Charter of 6th May, first of Henry 5, granting the cus tom called the cocket; the Charter of the 12 th May, Third of Henry 7, granting exemption from the new custom of poundage ; and the Charter of 8th February, 1 ith of Elizabeth, enabling the Corporation to elect a Searcher, Gauger, and other officers necessary within the city, (averring that the Customer and Controller were necessary officers to collect the cocket granted by Henry the Fifth). \u2014 Upon the first Charter, it was resolved that no custom or subsidy was thereby granted to tlie Corpora tion, for murage is nothing but a toll payable for reparation of walls, out of things sold in open market by retail ; whereas custom is paid for merchandise imported or exported across the sea, and sold in gross, and also because murage does not lie in grant but in prescription. Upon the second Charier it was resolved, that the grant of the custom of the city, called the cocket, was a good grant of the great customs of tlie place. Upon the third Charter it was resolved, that the exemption thereby granted did not give the Corporation a right to collect the duty in their city ; and the poundage having been vested in the fraternity of Saint George, by an Act of the fourteenth of Edward the Fourth, the grant of it by the third of Henry the Seventh was void, and none were exempt from poundage but those saved by the fifteenth of Henry the Seventh, _. 3. . .

Petitioner prays to be continued in quiet possession, which he can not enjoy without instituting a suit at the common law for each disturbance and trespass, where, be states, he cannot have an indif ferent trial in consequence of the great alliance, friendship, and kindred of the defendant in tbe country."], [419, "1 595-] CHANCERY, IRELAND. 331 37 Elizabeth Tbe defendant answering, alleges that Christopher Eustace, at the time of his attainder, was not seized of tbe lands wherein the dis turbance is supposed, neither was the pasture at that time, or at any time, parcel of the lands of Much Riverston, or was the pasture which the defendant holds ever found by any sufficient office or survey to be parcel of tbe lands of Riverston; but saith that the pasture in question is parcel of the lands of Killanston, in the county of Meath, and so has been known time out of memory ; that the bounds of tbe pasture is severed from Much Riverston by a little brook which runs from Cullenston to Merlingford, and so close by Much Riverston to tbe Nanny water; that long before the attainder, aud before tbe death of Eustace, one Mathew Bath, of Rathfeigh, was seized of the lands of Killanston, as of bis inherit ance, and being so seized, did enfeoff thereof to his use, one John Talbot, of Dardeston, who after, by the appointment of Mathew, granted the same lands of Killanston to Elizabeth Preston, for her life, remainder to Patrick Bath, father of defendant, and the heirs male of bis body. On tbe decease of Elizabeth, Patrick, de fendant's father, entered into possession, and, on the decease of the latter, the lands descended to defendant, as his son and heir, who entered into possession, and accordingly has enjoyed the same. Defendant further states that tbe tenants of Mathew, of Elizabeth, and of defendant's father, and tbeir ancestors, inheritors of the lands, had pastured and possessed the lands in severalty quietly, without disturbance of any, as tbeir proper soil, and as parcel of Killanston. In declaration of truth, the defendant further asserts that he, bis father and mother, and those who claimed under them, for the space of many years, set and demised the town of Killan ston to one Richard Ferrall, who then resided in Much Riverston ; and to William and Christopher Nolan, farmers ; by reason whereof the inhabitants of Much Riverston pastured the lands of Killanston, which is the only colour that the plaintiff can produce in evidence of pasturing the lands ; defendant further states that the cattle of the inhabitants of Much Riverston have been oftentimes distrained and impounded on tbe pasture, when it pleased the defendant or his ancestors; and that the cattle of the farmers of Killanston were never distrained or disturbed from pasturing tbe lands.

Witness oftimes resorted to Brobill, where Shane and Meawe dwelled, after tbe marriage, and well remembers Meawe bare Shane a daughter, whose name was Dorry u-nyn- tan e, long before she departed or left her husband. To tbe third inter rogatory, he says that Meawe, contrary to lawe of Holy Church, de parted and left her husband Shane, after their marriage, and ran away with Oliver FitzGerald, of Loughsewdie, son of tbe Earl of Kildare ; witness was then a scholar in Fercall, and well remembers Meawe's departure, and the common report was, throughout all the countrie, that she ran away with Oliver.\" To the fourth interro<_ tory, he says, \"that Oliver kept Meawe in adulterie, and by her had issue, three sons, in tbe lifetime of Shane her husband, and that she during her continuance with Oliver, was commonly taken to live with him in an adulterous manner; \u2014 his cause of knowledo-e is by common fame, and report of the countrie. To the fifth interroga tory he says, that Oliver was executed for treason in Eno-land in the lifetime of Shane M'Hugh ; he well remembers that Oliver was sent into England, and heard how he was there executed - Shane was slayne long after by Shane M'Donnell O'Mulloy, and William Moyle O'Carroll. He heard that Shane had, in niarriao. goods with Meawe, after tbe marriage, many horses, good store of armor, and O'Connor's fast friendship, which was to him better than a great deal of other substance in those daies.

They were married in face of Holy Church, publicklie ; witness was, at tbe time of the marriage, a boy twelve years of age, and went with his father, Tery, to the marriage, where he saw it solemnized in the church of Kilbride ; one Rory O'Lenan was then curate, and married them together. After the marriage solemnized and done, they did keep and dwell together in Brohill, longtime, as man and wife, and so were taken and reputed of all men, and had issue betwixt them, a daughter, who lived long, but her name he doth not now perfectly remember ; witness's father and himself were near of kindred to Meawe, and were often- times in her bouse at Brohill, and be did see them cohabit and dwell together as man and wife, and such all the countrie people there- abouts did know. She left her husband and ran away with one Oliver, son of tbe Earle of Kildare, and lived with him as a concu- bine, and he well remembers that witness's father and mother, and many others of her kindred, were verie sorrowful for her bad be- haviour and light parts, and the whole countrie, at the time, was full of the report of her going away from her husband. She had issue three sons, named Henry, Thomas, and Gerald, who witness knew well, by right of name ; and the common report in all the coun- try then was, that Meawe lived with Oliver in adultery, and as a naughty harlot, having her own lawful and married husband then living; witness deposes this of his own knowledge, and by the report of many of good sorte, aud of her best friends, who hated her life and doings. Oliver was executed in England, in the lifetime of Shane, with others of his brethren, and Shane was murthered long after tbe execution of the Earl's sons. Shane received, after his marriage with Meawe, divers goods, as horses, cows, and harness, and he saw his own father pay some cows to Shane, as parcel of the marriage goods, but how many, he cannot remember. Teige O'Growgan, of Little Keppaghe, in Oughterrimye, in the county of Kildare, says, \" that Shane and Meawe were married in face of Holy Church, at Kilbride, in Fercall ; but tbe priest's name he doth not remember ; witness was then a pretty boy, living with his father and mother in Ballicowan, and did keep their sheep ; he went with his father and mother to the marriage, saw them mar- ried, and after the marriage they returned, and all the company that was with them, to Ballicowan, to dinner ; they afterwards lived together as man and wife, a long time, and she bare him a daughter ; they dwelt at Brohill, and lived very well, wanting nothing that witness knowetb, and he did see, with his eyes, the same to be true. After tbe marriage, Meagbe left Shane, contrarie to Holy Church, and ran away with a son of the Earl of Kildare, named Oliver, and remained with him as bis leamon or concubine, which be knows to be true, for he dwelt at Ballicowne at the time, and heard evil speeches reported of her by her own friends, kinsfolk, and others of the country. He heard it reported by his father, mother, and many others, that Meawe bare three sons to the said Oliver in adulteri,and that they were bastards.

Shane O'Grogan, of Balfeaghan, in the county of Meath, also proves the marriage, and states he \"was then a boy of a dussen yeares olde, dwellinge in Irrye, in the Queen's county, and was taken by two of his unkels into Fercall. where his unkles resided, by reason there was a plague then in Irrye ; and being with his unkells in Fercall, he there remained three yeares, or thereabouts. Of himself he can say nothing, but he heard his grandfather's brother, one Brian O'Growgan, who was foster father to Shane M'Hugh, declare and tell that Meawe did run awaye from her husband with one of the Earle's sons, named Oliver, and that Brian O'Growgan was verie sorrowfull for her follie. Oliver was executed before the murther of Shane M'Hugh a good while, for Shane lived till after the rebellion of tbe Earl of Kildare.\" Anne Nicawill, of Belfeagban, of the age of an hundred years or thereabouts, also proves tbe marriage, and states \"she was then a mayde of some twentie years, and went with her mother to the marriage. Her mother was foster-sister to Meawe, and was speci allie requested to the marriage. Meawe, contrary to tbe laws of tbe Church, left Shane, by inticement of Oliver, son of the Earle, who then dwelt at Ballymore-Loughsewdie. She ran away with him, and dwelt with him as his harlot and concubine, and this she doth not onlie speak, and know of her own knowlege, but also by the report of her mother, who many times found great faulte with her, cursed her, and would never after come near her. Her mother could never abide her after for that cause, being her foster-sister, and she heard her mother, many and divers times, speak and declare that Meawe lived but as a w , and bare divers bastards to Oliver, then called MTnerle. She well remembers that Oliver, with four of his brethren, was sent over into England, and there executed, and remembers that Shane lived after, a good space, and was mur dered. Witness dwelt in Ophaley at the time of the marriage, and saw both kyne, garrans, horses, and other things delivered and paide by Mawe's friends unto Shane for her marriage, in her estimation, to the value of \u00a3300, as money then went.\" Annable M'Geoghegan, of Kilcocke, says, that Meawe, daughter of Cahir O'Connor, of Ophaley, chief of bis name, was married to Mulloy ; she was present in the church of Kilbride, in Fercall, at the marriage, and afterwards went with them to dinner to Ballicowne, and then Shane took her to Brogbill, his own bouse where witness served as maid ; they afterwards kept and lived together as man and wife, and she bare him a daughter, who was married long after into Maherquirk, to one Morish Dillon. Meawe did privatelie steale away from Shane and went with Oliver, one of the sons of the Earle, and continued with him, who kept her as a harlot and concubyne, of long time, and she bare him three sons ; at the birth of every one of whom she was present with Meawe, and did her tbe best service she could ; but everie bodie that knew them did both think and speake that they lived in open adultery, and that"], [539, "CHANCERY, IRELAND.

(a IHanse. \u2014 An old Gothic word, signifying a society of Merchants, for the good usage and safe passage of merchandise from one country to another. The Hanse, or mercatorum societas, was endowed with many large privileges by princes within their territories, and had four principal seats or staples, where the Almain, or German and Dutch merchants, being the founders of this society, had an especial house ; one of which, in London, was called the Steel Yard. A commercial union called the Hanseatic league was formed by a number of port towns in Germany, in support of each other against the piracies of the Swedes and Danes; this association began in 11G4, and the league was signed in 1241. At first it consisted only of towns situate on the coasts of the Baltic, but its strength and reputation increasing, there was scarce any trading city in Europe but desired to be admitted into it, and in process of time, it consisted of sixty-six cities. In 1630, the only towns of note of this once powerful league retaining the name were Lubeck, Hamburgh, and Bremen. Dr. Robertson, in his History of the Emperor Charles V., says :\u2014\" Towards the middle of the thirteenth century, the nations around the Baltic were extremely barbarous, and infested the sea with their piracies ; this obliged the cities of Lubeck and Hamburg, soon after they began to open some trade with these people, to enter into a league of mutual defence. They derived such advantages from this union, that other towns acceded to their confederacy, and in a short time eighty of the most considerable towns scattered through those vast countries which stretch from the Baltic to Cologne, joined in the famous Hanseatic league, which became so formidable, that its alliance was courted, and its enmity dreaded by the greatest monarchs.

It is derived through the French guarteron, from the medi\u00e6val Latin quarteronus or quortrona, and was probably brought in after the invasion. Carucate is also of foreign extraction, being derived from caruca \" a chariot,\" which in medi\u00e6val Latin, denoted a plough, and passed into the French charm!; from which was also borrowed in Ireland, the form carewe or carve, hence it denoted a plough land. In an English charter of Richard I., a carucata is declared to consist of 60 acres. Spelman observes \u2014 \" Carva seu potius carucata terr\u00e6 est e\u00a3 portio qu\u00e6 ad unius aratri operam, designated A ploughland; Matheo Paris, hida.

To find names of liquid measure applied to land is strange, and still more so when it is remembered that they are English, and in such an Irish quarter as East Breffny. They had all become naturalized long before 1600, for we find soon after that date, townland names into which these words enter in combination with Irish terms of qualification, as Tattenheglish, Tattenamona, &c. ; so also Pottlebane, Pottleboy, Pottleduff, Pottlereagh ; denoting white, yellow, black, and mottled pottle.

in which manner also long time hath been used, to our great charges, and yet little good effects have followed thereof, saving three or four only near to Athlone ; and yet as wee be now lately advertized by you, one of the chiefest of them who bad submitted, Fardorogb O'Kelly, is newly revolted, but upon what occasion, or what is don or ment to reform him, wee have no report made, neither yet have we any report from John Norrys and Fenton, what hope there is of bettring of that disordered state, and therefore, by reason of these uncertainties, we cannot absolutely prescribe any special manner of proceeding, but presently do make choice of this manner of proceeding, by degrees, as hereafter followeth : the Province of Connaught being chiefly to be regarded \u2014 fir.t, considering the great number of complaints made against Bingham, by the people of that province, pretending the great wrongs and extortions by him and his followers, to have been tbe cause of their disloyalties; like as we have caused them to understand our princely disposition and clemency in yielding to have their complaints beard and tried, and the same to be reformed by tbe correction of Bingham, if be should be thereof duly convicted, so wee continue in the same mind ; and as Bingham of late came hither into this realm, with pretence to purge himself of the complaynts which are properly to be heard and examined in that realme, wee conceived that displeasure against him, as we did not only forbid him any access unto us, or to our Council, but com mitted him to prison, where he remayned until this few dayes, being only removed out of prison, to other custody, by reason of bis sick nes, and to tbe intent he should be returned thither into that realme; and so, without yielding to him any audience here as he hath re quired, we now send him thither in the custody of the bearer, Conyers Clifford, requiring you, the Deputy and Council, to let this, our severe proceeding against him, be made known unto tbe prin cipal complainants in Connaught, by the means of Norris or Fenton, if they shall think the same may further the disposition of the com plainants to return to tbeir obedience; and now, considering that we have suspended Bingham from the government and rule which be held there before time, and that it is convenient to have the office supplied during the suspension, we have made choice of the bearer, Conyers Clifford, knight, a gentleman of good sufficiency for service both in war and peace, having been heretofore employed in that province, so he is acquainted therewith ; and, therefore, wee will and require you, and by warrant hereof, do authorize you and our Chancellor to cause tbe like commission, under the great seal, to be made, to authorize Conyers Clifford to exercise the office of Princi pal Commissioner there during our pleasure, iu like manner as Bing ham was authorized to doe ; and besides the commission, you shall deliver to him, in writing, such instructions as heretofore have been given by any our former Deputies and Council to Bingham, with"], [561, "1597-3 CHANCERY, IRELAND. 473 39 Elizabeth such other cautions to be added thereto as the tyme requireth ; and because tbe entertainment of Bingham as Principal Commissioner, and of sundry other officers joined with him for the government there, the charges of their dyet, the pay of forty horsemen and a hundred footmen, have been borne only by the profits that did arise in that province by force of certain compositions made by the chief tains there for sums of money, amounting yearly, by estimation, to \u00a33,000 or more, besides certain sums answered to us, both for the re venue of our lands and tbe impost of wynes in that province, with which yearly sums those charges were defrayed, and now being un certain how much may be had and received of the composition, revenue, and impost, by reason of the general revolt and disobe dience of tbe people there, we cannot specially direct the continu ance of that former government, but with tbe mean3 of so much of the same profits as can be recovered, or as from time to time may be recovered, either by means of treaty or inducement, or by forcing the parties chargeable with the yearly payments ; and, therefore, we would have you, the Deputy and Council, with the privity of Conyers Clifford, aud with those who have been in commission with Bingham, first to enforme yourselves how much of the composition rent is presently to be had, and of that, to cause allowance to be made to Conyers Clifford, as Principal Commissioner, after the rate of an hundred pounds yearlye, and an allowance also for the wages of forty horsemen, and the band of footmen which Richard Bingham had, of which two companies, we will that Conyers Clifford shall have the like charge, during our pleasure. \"And as far forth as any larger sums of money may be levied in that province, wee think it fitt that the Justice, Attorney, Clerk of the Council, aud other officers heretofore appointed, be now newly placed in commission ; and as far as the money will serve, that may be recovered in that province, from time to time, by tbe composi tion renewed and imposte, the same sums to be received by Conyers Clifford and his justice and officers repairing to the province, to be allowed by him for their diett and stipendes as by tbe former estab lished was prescribed ; and in this manner we are occasioned to prescribe the reviving or continuance of this government with these several degrees of uncertainties, for that tbe state and condition of that province is, at this time, uncertain unto us ; and, therefore, we require you to advertise us presently, how these our orders may be executed, and, from time to time, also bow the same may be executed by recovery of our composition and revenue, wherein we doubt not but Clifford will employ himself, by all good means, to recover the same, and to enable him to do so, we require you to give him autho ritie, as John Norrys had, over all tbe forces that shall continue in that province, which numbers we know not how many to limit, for lacke of knowledge of the state of that countrie, but refer the num bers, to be there continued, to your discretion, upon good consulta tion thereof had ; and for this purpose we will you, the Deputie, to require John Norris to repaire to Dublin, there to give bis best advice, as a principal counsellor of that estate, until we shall give him any other direction for further employment ; yet, nevertheless,"], [562, "PATENT AND CLOSE ROLLS, ['597- 474 39 Elizabeth, if, at tbe time of the receipt of these our letters, it shall appear unto you manifestlie, that John Norris, by treatie lately intended with the Erie of Tyrone, bath recovered any further number of tbe heads and chieftains of the province of Connaught to submit themselves to live and continue as obedient subjects, then shall you permitt John Norris to abide there to finish such offered submissions, and to receive sufficient pledges for tbe same before you shall remove him from thence; but without good appearance of such submissions to be presently perfitted and good'pledges taken, you shall not stay him any longer in tbe province to govern tbe forces there ; and yet if for these respects he shall continue for some time, you shall au thorize Conyers Clifford, with the former commission, to repaire unto that countrie as Chief Commissioner of that province, and join with Norris about the recovery of such persons to their obedience; and Norris is not to continue there longer than it may appear his presence is necessary, for some short time, to recover tbe country to obedience by such offered submissions without delay. \"As to tbe proceeding for the examination of tbe complaint against Bingham and tbe trial thereof, wee think it meet that, after the complainants shall be made privy of our hard usage of him here, and the remitting of him to be tried in Connaught, they be also warned, at some reasonable day, to come with their complaints and proofes to some place in Counaght, near Athlone ;

and after the same be fully beard by the four Commissioners, we will that true report be made by them, in writing, with all circum stances, for the understanding of the truth on both parts, to be sent unto us, so as thereupon we may determine our further pleasure for a good ending of that cause, to the good of the countrie. \"And although our meaning is not that Clifford shall be a Commis sioner in tbe cause concerning Bingbam's trial, yet, to tbe intent he may be the better acquainted both with the state of the countrie hereafter, and presently being there appointed our Chief Commis sioner, during our further pleasure, our will is that he shall be pre sent at all the proceedings. \" Upon the perusalof the charges answered by tbe composition, we find that the Earle of Thomond of late contrived to have \u00a3200 a year paid him out of tbe same composition if tbe same might so bear it, which Bingham made some difficulty to pay, by reason sometimes the composition was not able to satisfie the necessary charge, and therefore, at this time, we would be persuaded to think it the harder, and not to expect the payment thereof hereafter, but as the compo sition may bear it, wherewith we doubt not but he ought to rest satisfied. \" We think it convenient, that although Bingham has interest in"], [563, "1 597-] CHANCERY, IRELAND. 475 39 Elizabeth the office of Athlone, during the time he shall be suspended from the government of Connaght, that Connyers Clifford shall occupy tbe same room ;

and knowing by many laws of her relme of England, namely, by one made in the third year, and one other in the nineteenth yere of her Majesty's grandfather, of famous memory, King Henry the Seventh, that the transportation of moneys of the coyne and standard of England into this her relme of Ireland, is severely for bidden, under great penalties; perceiving also by experience in some parte heretofore, but more fullie and apparentlie now of late years, since the last rebellions, which have caused her Majesty to sende greate soms of money into this realm for the payment of her armie and for other services, that a great part of such moneys, into this realme sent, do either come into the hands of the rebells by divers slights and cunnings of theirs, who, by tbe use and means there of, trafficinge in foreign countries, relieve themselves with such warlike provisions as they neede, as with powder, lead, match, arms, weapons of all sortes, and with wines, cloth, and other necessaries, without which they could not possibly so long subsist in their treasonable courses, bring so huge calamaties to the rest of our good subjects, and waste to tbe whole realm, or els the sterling moneys, as well in respect of their goodness,, being better than the moneys of other countries, as also for want of merchandize wherein to employ them, which this countrie now, specialise since the rebellion, doth not yield, are partly by merchant strangers and partly by the natural merchants of the country, using trade in foreign countries, transported from hence to the said contries, to the inestimable losse and impoverishment, as well of the relme of Ireland, as also chiefly of her Majesty's relm of England; therefore, in her Majesty's princely wisdome she entered into consideration, with tbe advice of her Privy Council, how those great inconveniences might be avoided, and hath founde, after long and serious debatinge, that the readiest waye to prevent the same is to reduce the state of her monies to tbe ancient course of her progenitors, that is, to a differ ence in fines (fineness) betweene tbe moneys of the realme of England and her realme of Ireland ; and for that purpose hath caused great quantities of moneys, according to that auncient standard, which was in use for this realme in the days of her Ma jesty's father, brother, and sister, to be coined here into several peeces of shillings, six pence, and peces of three pence, stamped with her Highness's arms, crowned, and inscription of her usual stile on"], [667, "i6oi.] CHANCERY, IRELAND. 579 43 Elizabeth the one side, and on the other with au harpe crowned, being the arms of this her kingdom of Irelande, with the inscription \"posui '\u25a0 Deum adjutorem meum,\" and also certain pieces of smalle moneys of mere copper, of pence, halfepence, and fartings, for the use of the porer sorte, stamped on each side as the other, and the same monies so coined, hath sent into this her realme of Ireland, there to be established as the lawful and currant moneys of this realme, and so to be uttered and used, as well to herarmyeand officers, in payment to them, as also to all other her subjects of this realme and others heere abidinge or hither resorting for traffique and intercourse of buying, selling, and all other manner of trading amongst themselves, which said coines as well of silver of this new standard, as also of mere copper for small moneys, her Majestie doth hereby publishe and make known to all men to be from henceforth, immediately after the publishing of this proclamation, her coine of moneys established and authorized to be lawful and currant within her realm of Ireland and proper to this kingdome;

His cause of knowlege is that he, deponent, making a challenge unto Morishe for abusing Edmond Nugent in saying that 'he wrote more in tbe deed than Morishe allowed him to do,' whereupon Morishe showed tbe deed to depo nent, which he then perused and read, and saw no corruption therein at all, to his knowlege ; he heard Morishe say and swear \" that the deed was taken from his wife by tbe rebels after deponent perused the writing which, after the due perfection, was left as a pledge with Morishe, until Nugent would pay a sum of money for him.\" \u2014 William Delamare, of Rarorye, says, that \" he was in company with Edmond and Morishe at the hill of Leyne, and there heard some speeches concerning the perfection and delivery of the deed which he understood was formerly delivered by Piers Nugent to Morishe. He remembers that Edmond Nugent, in his own presence, at that time, called to Morishe for the deed, who made answer that 'he had left it in keeping with his wife, and the rebells had taken it away from her.' He said ' be would perfect another deed to the same effect to Edmond whensoever be would, only that he would reserve the fishing to himself,' whereupon Edmond told him that \"he would have it perfected according to the former deed,\" which was that he should have the fishing as well as the land, but Morishe refusing, they broke off without the second agreement. Witness says he heard it reported that the deed was kept back on purpose to defraud Edmond Nugent of his bargain, and witness verily believes it was, because he once heard Maurish promise that be was willing to have perfected another deed to Edmond according to the effect of the former deed, although he then refused to do the same unless he might reserve the fishing to himself. Witness heard Maurish confess having the deed; the parties being in deponent's bouse the night afterwards.\" Numerous other witnesses depose to the perfection of the deed and delivery of seisin and possession.
