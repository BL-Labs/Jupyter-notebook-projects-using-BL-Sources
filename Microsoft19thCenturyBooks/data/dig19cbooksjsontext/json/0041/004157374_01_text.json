Having been much employed in the study and examination of the Modern Architecture of England, I lately wrote a work on the improvements of its Metropolis ; and in some other of my publi cations, as in the \" Life of Sir Christopher Wren,\" in the \" An nals of the Fine Arts,\" and in the \" London in the Nineteenth Century,11 I ventured some free but honest criticisms on the archi tecture of our Public Buildings. But it has been suggested, that a work more comprehensive in plan, more general in arrangement, and more complete in accounts of the whole Metropolis, than the desultory opinions and particular descriptions of the \" London in the Nineteenth Century,11 was desirable.

The purpose of my present undertaking may be gathered from the title page, yet, a few observations on its advantages, in com parison with other works on the same subject, may be permitted. In addition to the ample accounts of the squares, streets, lanes, courts and alleys, given in Mr. Lockie's Topography of London, which is a work now become of little use, through the sweeping away of entire districts, by the excavation and formation of the St. Katherine Docks and warehouses, by the enlargement of other docks, and the establishment of various great commercial under takings, by the formation of Regent-street, and by the vast addi tions to all the environs of the metropolis, particularly to the western and north-western portions, all of which I have omitted or added as the case required, this work contains brief historical notices, architectural descriptions, and other details of all the churches, companies1 halls, and other public buildings. To these I have added the names of the patrons and incumbents of all the livings, and in what diocese, archdeaconry, jurisdiction or exemp tion, they are situated, whether the incumbents are rectors or vicars, and the dates of their several institutions. Also descrip tions and boundaries of the city wards and precincts, the names of their principal streets and public edifices, their aldermen, and number of their common-councilmen, and other ward officers ; accounts of the principal collegiate, scholastic and charitable institutions, hospitals, dispensaries, and asylums, with the names of their present patrons and governors, medical and other officers.

The correctness of these lists are the more to be depended on, as they have all been acquired by myself, from the best authorities. No pen has been employed in this work but my own, except in the transcription of the alphabetical arrangement of the articles, from my rough draughts prepared from Mr. Lockie's once useful and meritorious work. The descriptions may be considered too brief, but the work is not intended to be so much a full description of every particle, as a brief abstract of the great aggregate, and of the minor portions, that compose \" The Metropolis .of England.1\" That there are errors, no one can be more aware of than myself, but from the before mentioned circumstances, I take them freely and wholly upon myself. Yet I hope and trust, they will be found so unim portant, in comparison with the mass of information that I have accumulated, by the humble drudgery, as Dr. Johnson calls it, of the pioneer, into this small volume, that my kind readers will excuse and correct them. Any information of such errors of omission, or of commission, or of suggestions for improvement in a Second Edition, if a second edition should be required, from any of my readers, will be esteemed a favour, and be thankfully received.

This distinguished and beautiful portion of the metropolis was designed and executed by Messrs. John, Robert, James and AVilliam Adam, the well-known archi- tects, on the site of the ancient Durham- yard, then a district of mud and coal wharfs. On this low spot they erected a series of arches, terraces and subterranean streets, and spread forth on their surface that variety of streets known by the name of \" The Adel- phi,\" as being the production of \" the bro- thers.\" The various streets are designated after them, as that fine row of mansions which faces the Thames is called, by way of excellence, \" the Adelphi terrace ;\" and the other streets from their christian names, John-street, Robert-street, James-street and William-street.

This court of judicature is held in Doctors' Commons, at the second house on the left from No. 7, Great Knight Rider-street, in the street so named. It is held under the jurisdiction of the Lord High Admiral, or the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, who take cognizance of all causes and pleas, criminal and civil, which relate to mer- chants and mariners. Their proceedings are guided by the principles of the civil law ; but in criminal cases, as the trial of pirates, and crimes committed on the high seas, and upon large rivers below the first bridge which crosses them, the process is then conducted under a special commis- sion from the crown, by a judge, jury and witnesses. Such trials are generally held at the Sessions-house, in the Old Bailey. This court was erected in the reign of Edward\" III., and was originally held in Southwark. The officers of this court are the judge of the admiralty, who must be a civilian, two advocates general, a counsel, a solicitor, two proctors, a registrar, and a marshal, who carries a silver oar before the judge. The present officers of this court are, Judge of the Court, the Right Hon. Sir Charles Robinson, D.C.L. ; King's Advocate General, Sir Herbert Jenner, D.C.L. ; Admiralty ditto, James Henry Arnold, D.C.L. ; Counsel to the Admi- ralty and Navy, Henry J.

ADELPHI-Terr., The, is the before- mentioned row of mansions facing the Thames, erected parallel to the Strand and the river by Messrs. Adam. The view from this terrace, beginning at West- minster-bridge on the west, crowned by the antique towers of the Abbey, and Waterloo- bridge on the east, beautifully surmounted by the majestic cupola and elegant turrets of St. Paul, is almost unequalled for variety and architectural beauty. The central si- tuation of this fine terrace, and its airy and healthy qualities, have always rendered it among the most desirable spots in the me- tropolis for a town residence. ADELPHI THEATRE, The, a small commodious theatre, which is opened under a licence from the Lord Chamberlain, for the performance of burlettas, ballets and pantomimes. It was originally opened by an ingenious and clever woman, a Miss Scott, who wrote, composed the music, and acted in her own pieces. It is now under the management of Messrs. Mathews and Yates, and is much patron- ized for the intellectuality of its dramatic pieces and the abibty of its actors. ADELPHI WHARFS, The. Thebefore- mentioned wharfs stand under the Adelphi streets and terrace. The principal access to them is down Durham-street, at No. 65, in the Strand, under the mansion and repository of the Society of Arts.

ALBANY, Mansion and Chambers, Picca- dilly, formerly York-house, is at No. 52 in Piccadilly, and adjoining to Burlington- house. The mansion in the centre was designed by Sir William Chambers for Lord Melbourne, who exchanged it with his royal highness the late Duke of York for the present Melbourne-house, adjoining the Horse-Guards in Whitehall. On its being parted with by the duke, the mansion was converted into the present range of chambers, or temporary residences for the nobility and gentry, and the gardens and court-yard built upon for similar purposes. It was then named Albany, after its late royal occupier's second title. AIR'S ALMS HOUSES, White' s-alley, Coleman-street, are in the second turning on the left above No. 61, Coleman-street.

St. ALBAN'S CHURCH, Wood-street, Cheapside, is situated about the middle of the east side. It is an indifferent at- tempt at the pointed style of architecture by Sir Christopher Wren, who, it is clear by this and other of his churches in the an- cient English style of Gothic architecture, had but little knowledge and feeling for this appropriate and elegant style of eccle- siastical architecture. It is dedicated to St. Alban, the Anglo-protomartyr who suf- fered under the persecution of Diocletian, and gave his name to the ancient town and abbey of St. Alban, in Hertfordshire. The first church on this site was erected in the year 930, and dedicated to the same saint. After various repairs, the ancient church was taken dov/n in 1634, and another erected, that was destroyed by the great fire of London in 1666, when the present edifice was erected after the same plan as the former. The living is a rectory, in the patronage of Eton college, and the dean and chapter of St. Paul's, alternately ; and the parish of St. Olave, Silver-street, was united to it after the fire. Its present rec- tor is the Rev. Edward J. Beckwith, one of the minor canons of St. Paul's, who was instituted in 1800. In Munday's edition of Stow are several curious epitaphs trans- cribed from this church, particularly the fol- lowing : \u2014 ALBANY-Pl., Walworth, is in East -street, formerly East-lane, on the east side of the high road leading from the Elephant and Castle to Camberwell.

The island of houses between Grafton-street and Picca- dilly, was formerly the mansion and gar- den of the Duke of Albemarle, who pur- chased them of the Earl of Clarendon, whose seat it had long been. On the disposal of the property by the duke on building leases, the present houses in Albemarle-street, and those at their back in Boud-street, formerly called Albe- marle-buildings, were erected. The Cla- rendon Hotel in New Bond-street, is on part of the property, and so named from that cause. ALBION-Pl., Blackfriars'-road, is the large square on the south side of Black- friars-bridge, corresponding with Chatham- place on the north.

But on the dissolution of the monasteries the advowson was given to the Archbishop of Canterbury. It escaped the fire in 1666, and is of considerable extent, being one hundred and eighty feet long, sixty-seven broad and thirty-five high ; it has a plain bell tower, with a well proportioned turret, about eighty feet in height from the ground. This church is of considerable antiquity, as appears from the circumstance of Richard the First having founded and endowed a chapel within its walls. Its present vicar is the Rev. S. J.

It derives its name from its deification to all the saints or hallows, and its epithets, to distinguish it from an adjoining church of the same name, which was called the less. It is also in ancient books caUed the more, or the greater, and, ad F\u0153num, in the ropery, from its vicinity to some rope walks. This church was founded by the ancestors of the Despencer family, from whom it passed to the crown, till in 1546 Henry the Eighth gave it to Thomas, Archbishop of Canterbury, in whose successors it has remained to the present day. It is a rectory, and one of the thirteen peculiars in London, belonging to the Archiepisco- pal see of Canterbury. After the fire of London, the parish of Allhallows the Less, originally called Allhallows, super cella- rium, from being built on arched vaults or cellars, was united to Allhallows the Great, and the present church, built from the designs of Sir Christopher Wren, erected for the use of both parishes. Its present rector is the Rev. Wm. St. An- drew Vincent, a prebendary of Chichester, who was instituted in 1788. \" Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.\" On the representation of a book above her bust is the following : \" They that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Sion, which shall not be removed.\" On the right side of the monument, \" Spain's rod, Rome's ruin, the Netherlands relief, Heaven's gem, earth's joy, world's wonder, na- tion's chief.\" On the left side, \" Britain's blessing, England's splendour, Religion's nurse, and Faith's defender.\" And beneath, \" I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course.\" Queen Elizabeth died the 21th March, 1602.\" ALLHALLOWS, Honey-lane, a small church-yard, upon which stood, before the fire of London, the small church of the above name. Being a very small parish it was united by act of parliament to that of St. Mary-le-bow in Cheapside.

Honey-lane Market, small as it is, occu- pies the site of two ancient parish churches; the one at the head of this article, and that of St. Mary Magdalen, Milk-street, which was also destroyed by the great fire in 1666 [See St. Mary-le-bow. The interior of this church is of the Tuscan order, is eighty-seven feet long, sixty feet broad and thirty-three feet high, built of brick and stone in a strong and solid man ner. The tower is plain, square, and divided into five stories, and having neither spire, turret or pinnacles, has the appear ance of being unfinished, which is very likely to be the case, as Sir Christopher Wren was too good a master of his art to erect such a foundation to carry nothing. Among the funereal monuments that were in the ancient church of Allhallows the Great, and that were destroyed by the great fire, was one of too interesting a nature to be omitted, even in a work like the present, where \" brevity is the soul\" of its excellence, if not of its wit.

A church stood here dedicated to the same patrons before the year 1053. It is a rectory, and one of the thirteen peculiars within the city, apper- taining to the see of Canterbury. The advowson appears to have been anciently in lay hands, as Brithmer, a wealthy citizen, with the approbation of Archbishop Stigand and Dean Goderic, gave it with a messuage adjoining to the cathedral church of Canterbury in the year 1503 ; by virtue of which donative it still remains in the gift of the dean and chapter of the Metropolitan Church. The present rector is the Rev. Walter Brown, a prebendary of Canterbury, who was instituted in 1810. It is a neat, plain, and like all Sir Christopher Wren's churches, a well proportioned edi- fice. The body is eighty-four feet in length, fifty-two in breadth and thirty in height. Edward Camel was its incumbent. It was anciently a rectory, under the patro nage of the De Walthams, till 1365, when Simon, Bishop of London, presented it to the abbot and convent of De Grace, near the Tower. At the reformation it de volved to the crown, and was afterwards sold by James I. to George Bingley and others in soccage.* It came afterwards into the possession of Lady Slany, who be queathed it to the Grocer's Company, who stillhold the advowson, but it is not in charge.

It is a rectory, the patronage of which was anciently in the prior and convent of the Holy Trinity, near Aldgate, who in 1335 presented it to Thomas Richer de Sanston. At the dis- solution of religious houses in the reign of Henry VIII., this church, with the priory to which it belonged, was surrendered to the crown, in whose gift the advowson still remains. Its present rector is the Rev. Robert Nares, a canon residentiary of Litch- field, archdeacon of Stafford, and a prebend- ary of St. Paul's. He was instituted in 1817- It escaped the fire in 1666, but became latterly so ruinous that in 1765 the parishioners obtained an act of parliament to pull it down and rebuild it ; which they did from the designs of the elder Mr. Dance, the (then) city architect, who also built the churches of Shoreditch and Bishopsgate. It is a plain substantial church, of brick and stone, with a well proportioned stone tower and cupola.

ALMS-HOUSES. For accounts of these, the reader is referred to the several articles under the title of their respective founders. ALPHA-COTTAGES, Regent's-park, a series of respectable dwellings on the western side of the said park, which de- rive their name from the circumstance of a builder of some taste taking the first piece of ground that was to be let, and building thereon a cottage for the residence of himself and family. An imitator fol- lowed, and, as imitators from the time of Horace were always \" a servile herd,\" forgot when his predecessor had said A, that he ought to have said B, and have called his imitation Beta Cottage, but multiplying first letters, named the whole concern, cottages, streets and roads, Alpha-cottages !

ALMONRY, The LITTLE, is the con- tinuation of the preceding, crossing Dean- street, and leading to Dean's-yard by the Abbey. On the site of the Almonry, vulgarly called the Ambry, stood origin- ally a chapel dedicated to St. Catherine, or, as Stowe says, to St. Anne. Near this place Abbot Islip, whose chapel is among the greatest beauties in the adjoining Abbey, erected, in 1474, the first printing- office that was ever established in England, when the celebrated AAllliam Caxton, a citizen and mercer of London, brought that invaluable art from Holland, and became the earliest printer in England.

St. ALPHAGE, the church of, is situated in Aldermanbury and London - wall, having an entrance from each. It derives its name from St. Alphage or Elpha^e a noble Saxon saint, and Archbishop of Canterbury, who was murdered at Green- wich by the Danes, in the year 1013. The former church, which was a small and mean edifice, escaped the flames in 1666, but has"], [29, "AME 13 AMI been recently rebuilt from the designs of the younger Mr. George Dance. It has the singularity of having elliptical columns instead of circular, where, being attached to the wall in a very narrow street, great projection could not be obtained, and con sequently produce a better effect of light and shade from the depth of the under cutting, than either pilasters or half co lumns.

There was a church on this site dedicated to the same saint as early as the year 1362, which was pulled down in 1532, and the present church erected in its room, at the expense of AVilliam Fitz- AVilliams, who was sheriff in 1507- It derived its name of Undershaft from a very lofty May-pole, anciently called a shaft, which was annually raised in the street near to it on May-day, and was higher than the steeple. The church is a plain Gothic structure, with a well lighted body, and a square tower, with pinnacles at the angles, and a campanile with six bells within them. It is a rectory, in the gift of the Bishop of London, and is cele- brated as containing the monument raised in memory of the faithful and able his- toriographer of the city, John Stow, who died on the 5th April, 1605, and, to the disgrace of his contemporaries, in great poverty.

The ancient church, which was destroyed at the fire of"], [32, "16 ANG ANG King's wardrobe to a spot now called Wardrobe-place, it received its present addition to its name. This church is supposed to have been founded about the same time as Baynard's Castle was built, and, perhaps, by the same nobleman, as the advowson was anciently in the family of Fitzwalter, from which it passed through many hands, till the year 1663, when it devolved to the crown, in whose gift it still remains. But the parish of St. Anne, Blackfriars, having been united to it after the fire of London, the right of presentation is alternately with the crown and the parishioners.

St. ANN'S and St. AGNES, Aldersgate, the church of, is on the north side of St. Ann's-lane, at the northern extremity of the New Post-officeinSt.Martin's-le-grand, and receives its name from being dedicated to St. Ann, the mother of the Virgin Mary, and its addition from its situation as being formerly just within the ancient Aldersgate. It was formerly designated St. Ann in the AVillows, from the number of trees of that species which grew in that neighbourhood. The foundation of this church is very an- cient, and mention is made of it as so in 1322. It is a rectory, and the patronage was formerly in the dean and canons of the conventual church of St. Martin's-le-grand, until that corporation was annexed to the abbey of AA'estminster ; when the abbot and convent, and after them the bishop of AVestminster, became patrons. On the suppression of the bishopric of Westminster by Queen Mary, she gave it to the Bishop of London and his successors, in whom it still remains, alternately, with the dean and chapter of St. Paul's. The present rector is the Rev. John Hutchins, who was pre- sented by the Bishop of London in 1796. The old church was destroyed by the fire of London, and the present church was erected on its site by Sir Christo- pher Wren in 1680, and the parish of St. John Zacchary united to it.

R. M'Leod, D.D., who was instituted in 1 806. The walls of this church are of brick, with rusticated angles of Portland stone. At the east end is a large modilhon cornice and triangular pediment. It was repaired by the late S. P. Cockerel!, Esq., about twenty-five years since, and the tower and spire taken down and rebuilt. The original organ was presented to the church by AVil liam III., and at the time of the above repair, was removed into the church of St. Michael, Royal College-hill, and entirely repaired by the late Mr. Gray, under the superintendance of the father of the editor of this work, and a very fine new one erected in its stead, by that able organ builder Mr. John Gray, sen. A very handsome painted window was also added to the east end at the same time. The interior, since Mr. Cockerell's repairs, is very handsome. The roof is divided into panels, and supported by columns of the Ionic order, and the gallery by columns of the Tuscan order. In spite of theridicule that somehypercritics of a quarter of a century ago attempted to affix to the new tower and spire, it is, with the exception of the clock, a very original, chaste and classical design ; but its origi- nality, hke the compositions of Vanburgh and Hawksmoor, were stumbling blocks to the pedants, and foolishness to the (self- called) critics. Among the monuments appertaining to this church is one that de- serves peculiar attention. It is a tablet erected to the memory of Theodore An- thony Neuhoff, king of Corsica, who died in this parish in the year 1756, soon after his liberation from the King's Bench prison by an act of insolvency. The friend who gave shelter to this unfortunate monarch, whom nobles could praise when praise could not reach his ear, and who refused to succour him in his living miseries, was himself so poor as to be unable to defray the cost of his funeral. His remains were mented ceiling. At the four angles the ceiling is lower, and is divided into square sunk panels, within each of which is a circle enriched in its circumference by fretwork. St. ANN'S SOCIETY SCHOOLS are situated one in St. Ann's-lane, opposite the northern end of the New Post-office, and one on the eastern side of the road leading from Brixton to Streatham. They originated in 1709, with some well-disposed persons in the parish of the before-mentioned St. Ann, who raised subscriptions and contributions for the establishing of these schools. The asylum at Brixton-hill is a very spacious and handsome building, erected in 1829, on a most salubrious site, from the designs of John Henry Taylor, Esq., F.S.A., an architect of much taste and knowledge. For nearly a century this society only af- forded a day-school in London, for educa- ting and clothing thirty boys and thirty girls, not chosen indiscriminately from any parish, nor even confined to the metropolis, but open to necessitous legitimate children of every condition, whether orphans or not, and more especially to children of persons who have seen better days, but from un- foreseen casualties have been compelled to seek its assistance. The new asylum at Brixton-hill is calculated for the reception of one hundred boys and fifty girls, and is a handsome substantial building, with an Ionic portico in the centre, and two wings raised on a handsome rusticated ground story. The Duke of Sussex is patron ; William Wilberforce, Esq., president. There are also thirty vice-presidents, three house-stewards, and a committee of ma- nagement, changed every year. Mr. Tho- mas Jones, of No. 20, King's-arms-yard, Coleman-street, is the secretary, by whom all communications will be received, and inquiries answered. St. ANN'S, Soho, the church of, is situated on the south of Dean-street, Soho, near the lower end towards Gerard-street ; and the church-yard reaches from Dean-street on the east to Princes-street on the west. This church and parish owe their origin to the same cause as the last named, and was se- parated from the overgrown parish of St. Martin-in-the-fields by an act of parlia- ment, passed in the year 1661, the provi- sions of which were however not completed till 1678, and the present churcli was fi- nished in 1686, on a spot formerly called Kemp's-fields.

It extends from Lower Chapman-street, to Back- lane. which, according to Stow, was originally called Limehurst, a Saxon word, implying a grove of lime trees, on account of the number of that description of trees which formerly grew in that neighbourhood. Limehouse was formerly a hamlet belong ing to the parish of Stepney, or Stebon heath ; but being joined to the metropolis by the great increase of buildings in that part, the commissioners for building fifty new churches in Queen Anne's reign, or dered one of them to be built on this spot. It was designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor, a favourite pupil of Sir Christopher AA'ren, and architect of those fine edifices the churches of St. Mary Woolnoth, Lombard street, and St. George, Bloomsbury. [See those two churches.] The foundations were began in the year 1712, and was fi nished in 1724. It is a rectory, which is not to be held in commendam* and the advowson, as well as that of its mother parish, St. Dunstan's, Stepney, is in the principal and scholars of King's Hall, and Brazenose College, Oxford. The present rector is the Rev. John Radcliffe, who was instituted in 1807. The building is of singular but picturesque construction, and of great originality, particularly the tower and spire. The entrance door under the tower is protected by a portico, covered with a cupola. The tower is embellished by a large window, dressed with columns and pilasters of the Corinthian order. The angles of the tower are strengthened by massive pilasters, wbich have on their acro teria a series of sculptured vases. The up per portion of the tower is plain and mas sive, which supports four angular turrets, and a more lofty one in the centre. St. ANTHONY'S, or St. Anfholins, CHURCH, Budge-row, is at the south- west corner of Size-lane, Bucklersbury, and Budge-row, Queen-street, Cheapside, which runs in a direct line from Watling- street to Cannon-street. It was erected by Sir Christopher Wren, in 1682 ; and al- though it has no great pretensions to taste, it is a scientific, well-constructed church. The interior is of the Tuscan order, is sixty-six feet long, fifty-four broad, and forty-four high. The roof is in the form of an elliptical cupola, enlightened by four lantern windows, and supported by co- lumns of the Composite order. The steeple is composed of a plain solid tower, and an octagonal spire, with a Corinthian capital by way of a fintial, which is too for- mal for such an ornament, and leads the spectator to consider too much of the order whence it is derived, to think it either beautiful in itself or well applied to its situation. \u2014 This church receives its name from St. Anthony, an Egyptian hermit, and founder of the order of Eremites of St. Anthony. The time of its foundation is not known ; but that it is of great anti- quity appears from its being in the gift of the canons of St. Paul, in 1181. It was rebuilt, in 1399, by Thomas Knolles, Lord Mayor of London; again, in 1513, by John Tate, mercer. In 1616 it was repaired and beautified at the expense of one thou- sand pounds, raised by the contributions of several munificent parishioners ; but being destroyed by the fire of London, in 1 666, it was rebuilt in 1682, as before mentioned. To this parish is annexed that of St. John the Baptist, whose church, before the fire of London, stood close by Walbrook. The antiquity of this church appears from the mention of it by Ralph de Diceto, Dean of St. Paul's in 1181. The canons of St- Paul were its patrons, and gave it to the convent of St. Helen, in whom it con- tinued till the suppression of their nunnery, when it devolved to the crown, in which it still remains, so that the presentation to the united parishes is alternately in the crown, and dean and chapter of St. Paul's.

ANTIQUARIES, SOCIETY OF._This society holds its meetings at its apartments in the south wing of Somerset-place, Strand, next the street ; the entrance to which is at the first door on the left under the first archway nearest to Temple-bar. It was originally founded about the year 1580, by some of the most learned men in the kingdom, who possessed a love for the study of antiquities. Its meetings were frequently discontinued till its revival in the year 1717, by a number of gentle- men of similar pursuits, but who were in- clined more particularly to the study of the antiquities of their native country. Their number was originally restricted to one hundred, and the members met weekly. At length, in 1751, they obtained the grant of a charter from king George II., who became their founder and first patron. Under this charter they became a body corporate, with power to have and use a common seal, and to enjoy other rights and privileges as are usual to corporate bodies. It also directs that the society shall be governed by a council of twenty- one members, of which, the president for the time being shall always be one ; and that Martin Folkes, Esq., shall be the first president, and twenty other members, whose names are enumerated to be the first council. The election for officers and council takes place on the 23rd day of April, St. George's day, in every year. In 1752 the society encreased its numbers to one hundred and fifty, and in 1755 to one hundred and eighty, exclusive of peers, privy councillors, and judges, that should be chosen after that time. They also gave the management of their affairs entirely to the council, who are a standing committee for that purpose ; and thereby assimilating their government to that of their more ancient neighbour the Royal Society. The rooms in which the society hold their meetings are contiguous to those of the Royal Society. The general meeting room is on the one pair story, and is both spacious and commodious. The li- brary is on the ground story, and very lofty, it contains a large collection of books, and"], [38, "APO 22 ARA City of London.

This large site of open ground is the exercising place of the an cient and Honourable Artillery Company, a volunteer association of armed citizens. The following is the account given by Strype, the historian, from Stowe's chro nicle of the origin of this company. \" In the year 1585, the city having been greatly troubled, and charged with con tinual musters and training of soldiers, certain gallant, active and forward citizens, having had experience both at home and abroad, voluntarily exercised themselves and trained up others for the ready use of war, so as within two years, there were ARTHUR-Pl., St. Luke's, is the first turning on the north and parallel to Great Arthur-street, and a part of Bell-alley leading from Goswell-street to Turk's - court and Golden-lane.

ARTICHOKE-Ct., Lambeth, is in Arti- choke-yard, the first turning on the left from Lambeth Marsh."], [41, "ART 25 ART almost two hundred merchants, and others of like quality, very sufficient and skilful to train and teach common soldiers the management of their pieces, pikes and halberds, to march, countermarch and ring. AVhich said merchants, for their own perfecting in military affairs and dis cipline, met every Thursday in the year, practising all usual points of war, and every man, by turn, bare orderly office, from the corporal to the captain. Some of them, in the dangerous year of 1588, had charge of men in the great camp at Til bury, and were generally called captains of the Artillery Garden, the place where they exercised. These took precedent of the merchants of Antwerp. \" But this useful Artillery exercise be came afterwards discontinued for a great while, till the year 1610 ; when by means of Philip Hudson, Lieutenant of the said Company, Thomas Laveroch, Robert Hughes, Samuel Arthors, Robert Green hurst and divers other gentlemen and citizens of London, this brave exercise was renewed and set on foot again. These gentlemen associated in the said garden, having sufficient warrant and toleration granted them by the Lords of King James's Privy Council, to whom they be came humble suiters in the beginning, for the prevention of all future misconstructions of their honest intent and actions therein. At length, the company grew so nu merous, amounting to nearly six thousand men, that the old Artillery-Ground, or garden, as it was then called, was too small to contain them. Therefore, they were obliged to seek a more convenient and capacious place for their exercises, and having procured a large field without Moorgate (the present Artillery-Ground), they removed thither about the end of the reign of James I. King Charles II., when Prince of AVales, enlisted himself in this company, as did his brother James, Duke of York ; who, after the restoration, took upon himself the command, and named it his own company. Our late King George IV., also, when Prince of AVales, was Cap tain-General of this Company, and paid it many honourable attentions. Among other donations to the company, King George I. gave \u00a3500, and its late President, Sir AArilliam Curtis, a pair of very handsome brass field pieces. The Artillery Company is governed by the King, who is Captain-General, , President ; Sir James Shaw, Bart., Vice-President ; His Royal Highness the Duke of Sussex, Colonel ; Charles Edward Cox, Esq., Lieutenant-Colonel ; James W. Freshfield, Esq., Major; Bewley W. Hemans, Esq., Adjutant ; the Rev. An drew Hatt, D.D., Chaplain ; Ralph J. Kirby, Esq., Quarter-Master ; James A. Gordon, Esq., M.D., Physician ; Robert Pugh, and William Kingdon, Esqs., Sur geons ; F.AV. Bossy, Sergeant-Major, and AVilliam Henry AVhite, Esq., Secretary. And having duly considered the necessity of the knowledge of arms in so populous a place, and the inconveniences that happened to Antwerp, and other their late populous and flourishing neighbour-cities, princi pally by reason of their neglect of that most noble exercise of arms and martial discipline in times of wealth and peace, these, therefore, now undertook, at their own private and particular charge, a weekly exercise of arms, after the modern and best fashion and instruction then in use. And, moreover, for their better ease and conve niency, they erected a strong and well furnished armoury in the said ground, in which were arms of several sorts, and of such extraordinary beauty, fashion, and goodness for service, as were hardly to be matched elsewhere.\" ARTILLERY-GROUND, The OLD, Bi- shopsgate, was a little to the north-east of what is now Devonshire-square, in Bishops- gate-street. The site was originally a spa- cious field called Tassel Close, from its being planted with tassels, or teasels, a species of thistle that are much used by cloth-workers. It was afterwards let to the cross-bow makers, who used to practise archery there ; but, being afterwards enclosed with a brick wall, served as an artillery ground, to which the gunners of the Tower repaired every Thursday to practise their art. The last prior of St. Slary Spital granted it to them for thrice ninety-nine years, and King Henry A^III. gave the company a charter. Hence this artillery-ground became subject to the municipality of the Tower ; and the streets, &c. which occupy its site being part of Union-street, Bishopsgate, and Artillery- lane, the whole of Duke-street, Gun-street, Seward-street, and Fort-street, compose one From this period, the Artillery Com pany increased greatly. Gentlemen re sorted to the Artillery-Ground from all parts, to learn military discipline, and having acquired a competent knowledge of the art of war, returned home to instruct the trained bands in every part of the kingdom."], [42, "ART 26 ART ARTISTS, BRITISH, SOCIETY OF.

He directed also for each alms man \u00a38, with half a chaldron of coals, and a gown of baize every third year, and the school-boys to be clothed and taught to read, write, and account; for which the masters were to receive salaries of \u00a330 each, in addition to their dwelling-house.

A few words relative to the founder may not be uninteresting to the reader. He was, as before-mentioned, one of the Lord Blayor's officers, and having, in a course of years, amassed a very large sum of money, by the most mercenary and oppres sive practices in his office, left it for the foundation of this splendid charity, and the anniversary sermons to his memory. At his death, says Stow, he so incurred the hatred and ill-will of his fellow citi zens, that the persons who attended his funeral, had great difficulty in preventing his corpse from being jostled off the shoulders of the bearers by the enraged populace, who seizing the public church bells, rang them for very joy at his un lamented death. He left also a sum to keep his monument in the church of St. Helen's, Bishopsgate, which he erected in his fife-time, in good repair. In this mo nument his body lies embowelled, em balmed, and in a chest or box, made with a lid and hinges, without any fastening, and a square piece of glass in the fid just over his face. It is a plain cubical monu ment, with a door for the sexton, who has forty shillings a year for the service, to go in and clear it from dust and cobwebs, but the keys of the iron rails about the monu ment and of the vault door are kept by the clerk of the Drapers' Company. BANK OF ENGLAND, The, is the large stone building on the north side of the Royal Exchange, Cornhill, bounded by Princes-street on the west, Lothbury on the north, Bartholomew-lane on the east, and Threadneedle-street, Bank-buildings, Bank-street and the Royal Exchange on the south. It is a spacious and splendid pile of buildings, erected at various periods, began originally by Sir. George Sampson, an architect of much knowledge, then added to by Sir Robert Taylor, and finally enlarged, many parts rebuilt, and brought to its present unity of design by John Soane, Esq., R.A., and Professor of Ar- chitecture in the Royal Academy. It is most substantially built of brick and Port- land stone, and has a most appropriate treasury looking appearance. The various elevations are of the Corinthian order, selected and adapted from the Temple of the Sybil at Tivoli. The interior courts, particularly the Lothbury court, and the various halls, offices and apartments, are designed with an originality and beauty almost unequalled in modern architecture. For the history of this great, opulent and influential association, the reader is referred to works more diffuse than the present. It is at present under the manage ment of Samuel Drew, Esq., Governor ; John Horsley Palmer, Esq., Deputy Go vernor ; twenty-four Directors ; John Knight, Esq., Secretary ; a Deputy and Assistant Secretary, a Standing Counsel, a Counsel in Chancery, three Solicitors, an Architect, a Chief Accountant (Wil liam Dawes, Esq.) to whom all its notes are made payable : a Deputy and Assistant Accountants, eighteen Cashiers, five Su pernumerary Cashiers, and an immense number of Clerks, of various denomina tions. BANGOR-Ct., Shoe-lane, is at the back of St. Andrew's Church, Holborn-hill, and on the west side of the north end of Shoe- lane. It derives its name from having been formerly the residence of the Bishops of Bangor. It was sold in 1647, by the trustees for the sale of bishops' lands to Sir John Barkstead, who was exempted from the penalties of the act for restraining new buildings in London. The last bishop, who appears to have resided here, was Bishop Dolben, who, having been formerly Vicar of Hackney, contributed to the re- pairs of the highway from Clapton through Hackney to Shoreditch, and dated his letter from Bangor-house in Shoe-lane, the 11th November, 1633.

In 1248, the brethren disposed of it to AV alter de Grey, Archbishop of York, who left it to his successors, for their town residence, and named it York-place. It was, however, seized by Henry ArIII. when Cardinal AA'okey incurred the penalty of pr\u0153munire,' by which all his goods and possessions were forfeited to the crown. Henry improved it in every respect, changed its name to Whitehall-palace, added a magnificent gallery, a tennis court, a tilt yard for tournaments, bowling greens and other appendages of a royal palace, and also built the beautiful gate across the street, designed by Hans Holbein. AArhen this gate was taken down about seventy years ago, AVilliam Duke of Cumberland had all the parts of it numbered for the purpose of having it erected at the top of the Long-walk, Windsor, but it was not carried into execution. From the time of Henry, AVhitehall-palace became the royal residence of the kings of England, till 1697, when it was entirely destroyed by fire, except the present building, which had been added to it in 1619 by James E, as a beginning of Inigo Jones's splendid design, which is well known to all con noisseurs in architecture. It is built en tirely of stone, and has been recently restored and renovated in a very masterly style by Sir. Soane. The elevation is divided into two principal stories, raised upon a rusticated basement. The lower story is of the Ionic order, and the upper of the Composite, with a lofty blocking course and balustrade above the upper en tablature. The ceiling of the interior is by Rubens, and painted by that great master while residing in England as an ambas sador. The subject is the Apotheosis of James I., and is in nine compartments. The pictures were cleaned, repaired and new lined under the directions of Sir Christopher AA'ren,* by BIr. Parry AA'alton, in 1687, and again by G. B. Cipriani, Esq., R. A., about twenty years ago. In front of this building, upon a scaffold erected for the purpose, Charles I. was be headed, on the 30th of January, 1648-9, having passed to the block through one of the windows. Within the area, behind this building, is a very fine statue in bronze of James II., by Grinlin Gibbons. BANKRUPT'S OFFICE, SECRETARY OF, is in Southampton-buildings, Hol- born.

The soldiers of the footguards who are on duty, are accommodated in a large gallery, built a few years since for their accommodation. Over the altar, are arranged the various eagles that were taken from the French in the various battles in the Spanish Peninsula and at AVaterloo.

Itwas the advanced post of Cripple gate, and like the others that surrounded the city, was always intrusted to the cus tody of some person of consequence in the state. This tower was granted by Edward III. to the Earl of Suffolk ; he made it his town residence.

The prin- cipal entrance next the street is enriched with the company's arms, and festoons of fruit and flowers. The court-room has a richly ornamented ceiling, and some fine pictures. Among which is a master-piece by Hans Holbein,representing Henry A'HE presenting a charter to the master and wardens of the company ; and a portrait of Charles II. The theatre, which is unused since the separation of the surgeons from the barbers, contains ranges of seats for the members to hear lectures. In this apart- ment is a bust of Charles I., figures of the seven liberal sciences, the twelve signs of the zodiac, the skins of a man and woman stretched on frames, and some valuable anatomical paintings and preparations. The company was incorporated in the thirty-second year of the reign of Henry VIII., by the title of The Masters or Go- vernors of the mystery or commonalty of Barbers and Surgeons of the City of Lon- don. Thus the company obtained the name of Barber-Surgeons, which they enjoyed till the 18th Geo. II., when the surgeons applied to Parliament to have this union dissolved, and they were formed into, first, a separate company, having their hall in the Old Bailey ; and still more lately into a royal college, with a handsome collegiate building and museum on the south side of Lincoln's-inn-fields \u2014 [See Royal Col- BARBICAN-Ct., Barbican, is at two houses on the left from No. 77, Aldersgate- street, by the side of No. 68 in Barbican.

St. BARTHOLOSIEAV THE GREAT, the church of, is situated on the north-east side of Smithfield, and at the north end of Duke-street. It escaped the fire in 1666, and is a large plain church of Saxon and Norman architecture one hundred and thirty-two feet long, fifty-seven broad, and forty-seven high, with a square tower crowned with an angle turret. It was ori- ginally a parish church adjoining that of the priory of St. Bartholomew ; but when the latter was pulled down as far as the choir, that portion was annexed by the king's order for the enlargement of the old church. It thus continued till Queen Slary gave it, with the residue of the priory church to the Blackfriars, who used it as their conventual church till the first year of Queen Elizabeth, when the friars were ejected, and the church restored by act of parliament to the parish. The present church is in nearly the same state as it stood in the reign of Edward VI. ; but the recent fire in Slay, 1830, has opened to view many of the beautiful and curious architectural antiquities which had been concealed by mean buildings. On the north side of the chancel is an BARTHOLOSIEAV CHAPEL, Little Bartholomew -close, was a Protestant Dis- senter's Chapel of some standing, held on a portion of the ancient Convent of St. Bartholomew ; to it was also attached a Protestant Dissenters' Charity School, founded by voluntary subscription, in Oc tober 1717, for the education of the Chil dren of Protestant Dissenters of all deno minations, and was maintained by interest of stock, annual subscriptions and dona tions, and occasional collections at ser mons.

Both the chapel and schools were destroyed by fire in the spring of 1830. St. BARTHOLOSIEAAr, BY THE EX- CHANGE, the church of, is situated at the south east corner of Bartholomew-lane and Threadneedle-street, near the north-east angle of the Bank of England. It was destroyed by the fire in 1666, all but the tower, which was cased and newly topped at the time of rebuilding the body of the church. This church is of very ancient foundation, for in the year 1331 John de Tyeme was presented to it, on the death of John de Aldeburgh, the rector, and it was then so entirely decayed that it was necessary to rebuild it. The living being at the time of the Reformation in the gift of the Abbey of St. Blary de Grace, it fell on the dissolution of the religious houses into the hands of the Crown, in whom the advowson, which is a rectory, has continued to the present time. The present rector is the Rev. George Shephard, D.D., preacher of Gray's-inn, who was instituted by the Lord Chancellor in 1807- elegant monument of Rahere, the founder of the splendid adjacent hospital, with his effigies painted in proper colours, and his hands joined over his breast as if in prayer, recumbent beneath an arch, with an angel at his feet, and a friar on each side of him in the attitudes of prayer. This monu ment was repaired and beautified by Wil liam Bolton, the last prior of this convent. The patronage of this church, which, in all probability, was anciently in the prior and canons of St. Bartholomew is now in private hands. This parish claims an exemption from the necessity of being free of the city to carry on retail trades within its boundaries. The present rector is the Rev. John Abbiss, who was instituted by the late William Phillips, Esq., of Caven dish-square, its patron, in 1819."], [58, "BAR BAR 42 St. BARTHOLOBIEW THE LESS, the church of, is situated within the prin- cipal gate of Bartholomew's Hospital, on the south-east side of AVest Smithfield. It was originally a chapel to the hospital, and was founded in the year 1102 ; but at the dissolution of the priory, it was con- verted into a parish church for the inhabi- tants of the precinct of the hospital. It is a vicarage, in the gift of the Lord Sfayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of the City, as governors of the hospital. The church is an old fabric, but was tastefully and substantially repaired, and the interior rebuilt in 1823, by Philip Hardwick, Esq., the surveyor to the hospital. The present vicar is the Rev. Samuel Wix, who was instituted by the governors in 1808. Since that time the hospital has received considerable benefactions from charitable persons, by which means the benefits of the charity have been much increased. The government of this and the four other royal hospitals within this city having been found inconvenient, and these five royal foundations having increased in utility and prosperity, and as many wealthy and charitable commoners had contributed very largely towards their permanent establishment, the particular privileges of each, and the power of the corporation, who were governors by virtue of their office, were much involved in doubt. It therefore became necessary that they should be correctly and distinctly acertained, as a dispute had subsisted for some years between the court of Common Council and the acting governors of these five royal hospitals relative to the right of the latter to participate in the government. At length an amicable compromise took place by written agreement, and an act of parliament, the 22 Geo. III., c. 77, was passed, by which the Common Council were empowered to appoint twelve of their own number to be governors of each of these foundations (Bethlem and Bridewell being considered as one) respectively, who were to continue so while they continued members of that court. The title of this hospital was then settled to be thus: \u2014 \" The Mayor and Commonalty, and Citi zens of the city of London, as Governors of the House of the Poor, commonly called St. Bartholomew's Hospital, near West Smithfield, London, of the foundation of King Henry VIII.\" In Sir. Highmore's work on the law of Blortmain and Charitable Uses* may be found this agreement and the act of par liament in full, to which the reader is referred, as their great length prevents their insertion in this work. The reader will there find the mode of electing gover nors, the style and title of each hospital, the manner in which the corporation is represented at the general courts of these five hospitals, and the mode of sealing deeds particularly detailed. It may be sufficient in this place to state, that the Common Council at their first corporation court after their annual election on St. Thomas's day, or at any subsequent court, nominate forty-eight of their members, of whom the names of twelve are sent to each hospital, Bethlem and Bridewell being St. BARTHOLOS1EAVS HOSPITAL, is a splendid charitable institution, that has been traced from the *earliest do- cuments and records to the benevolence of Raherus, or Rahere, in the year 1102. He is said to have been minstrel to Henry E, who repenting and quitting his gay disor- derly life, founded near this spot a priory of black canons, which he dedicated to St. Bartholomew, and became the first prior. He obtained from the king the grant of a piece of waste ground, upon which he built an hospital, for a master, brethren and sis- ters, sick persons and pregnant women, -f He endowed his priory with the sum of \u00a3553 a year, and the estates which he set- tled on this hospital were then valued at \u00a3305 a year.:\u00a3 This eminent benefactor to the poor and afflicted of his fellow-crea- tures, whose charitable memory is not likely to be forgotten while the English language shall endure, was buried, as before-men- tioned in a former article, in his church of St. Bartholomew the Great, where his tomb, still in perfect repair, affords a curious spe- cimen of ancient monumental sculpture. Both the priory and the hospital were surrendered to Henry VIII., who in the latter year of his reign re-founded the hos- pital, and endowed it with an annual re- venue of 500 marks, on condition that the City of London should pay an equal sum. This proposal being acceded to, the new foundation was incorporated by the title of \" The Hospital of the Mayor, Commonalty and Citizens of London, Governors for the Poor, called Little St. Bartholemew's, near West Smithfield.\" * Highmore's Pietas Londinensis. \u25a0f Cough's Camden.

D. 1102, refounded by Henry VIIE, 1546.\" Over the pediment are two reclining figures, repre senting lameness and sickness, in humble imitation of Cibber's fine recumbent sta tues of melancholy and raving madness, at Bethlem. The interior of this hospital is conve niently arranged, and cleanliness, returning health and comfort pervade all its apart ments. The grand staircase was painted gratuitously by Hogarth, for which he was made a governor for Use. The subjects are, the good Samaritan ; the pool of Bethesda ; Rahere, the founder, laying the foundation stone ; and a sick man carried on a bier, attended by monks. In the great hall is a whole length portrait of Henry VIII., and another of Dr. Ratcliffe, who deserves to stand second only to Rahere ; also a picture of St. Bartholomew, holding a knife as a symbol of his martyr dom, and a fine portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds, of Percival Pott, Esq., many years surgeon to the hospital. In one of the windows is a painting on glass of Henry VIII., delivering the charter of incorporation to the Lord Blayor. The management of this hospital has been so pure and free from reproach, and its revenues so faithfully applied, that its beneficial effects have been more extended than even its greatest benefactors could possibly have foreseen. Patients are received without limitation, and necessity is the only recommendation. Applications for admission are greatly facilitated by the readiness with which all information is given to the poor and their friends at the Steward's Office, which is in the north side of the quadrangle nearest to Smithfield, and where the necessary petition is given gratis. In this paper the name of the disease under which the patient labours is to be inserted, and some housekeeper is to undersign an undertaking to receive the patient when discharged, or to bury the corpse if the person should die in the hospital.

The annual court for all these hospitals is held at Christ's Hospital, on St. Blat- thew's-day, where the corporation is repre- sented by the Lord Blayor, Aldermen, and, the above mentioned twelve members of the Common Council for each hospital. Notwithstanding the whole of the buildings of this ancient hospital escaped the great fire in 1666, yet a considerable part of the houses which constituted its chief revenue were destroyed. The hospital was repaired 1691, and by the liberality of the corpo- ration and citizens its houses were rebuilt and its income restored. The progress of the institution was carried on uninter- ruptedly till 1729, when on a general survey, under the superintendence of Gibbs, the architect of St. Blartin's in the Fields, the buildings of the hospital were found by their antiquity to have become ruinous and dangerous. A subscription was therefore entered into by many of the governors and other charitable persons, among whom was Dr. Ratcliffe, to defray the expense. The latter, in addition to his munificent dona- tion, bequeathed a perpetual annuity of \u00a3500. a year for the improvement of the diet, and \u00a3100. a year to buy linen. The plan was prepared by Gibbs, their architect, and the first stone was laid on the 9th of June 1730, by Sir George Brocas, then Lord Blayor, and President of the Hospital. The principal entrance next Smithfield, is of earlier date, having been erected in 1702, as notified by an inscrip- tion beneath the statue of Henry VIIE, its second founder, which says that it was in the first year of Queen Anne, Alderman Sir AVilliam Pritchard being President. The building forms a spacious quadran- gle, each side being detached from the other, and joined only by stone screens and gateways. Each building is of Bath stone, with moulded dressings to the win- dows, and a cornice and balustrade at the top. Over the entrance next Smithfield is a statue of Henry VIIE, the second founder, over whom the corporation should place that of the benevolent Rahere, who endowed it so liberally from his own funds. Under this statue is inscribed, \" St. Baii- tholomew's Hospital, founded"], [60, "BAS BAR 44 Wheeler, Apothecary ; John Wood, Clerk and William AA'ix, Steward.

BENEVOLENT INSTITUTION, The, for the sole purpose of delivering Poor Slarried Women at their own habitations, is held in Castle-court, Strand. This charity was established in January 1780, by several respectable inhabitants of Lon- don and AArestminster, who, actuated by generous principles of humanity, entered on this laudable undertaking. It has met with the patronage and support of the public in a degree commensurate with its utibty, which cannot be too much com- mended. Its design is to afford poor mar- ried women, at their own habitations, the assistance of midwives regularly instructed in their business, and all necessary medi- cines during the time of their lying-in ; and in all cases of difficulty and danger, the advice and assistance of a physician and man-midwife. Since the commence- ment of this charity upwards of forty thou- sand poor married women have been so relieved.

The officers are a President, seven Vice Presidents, a Treasurer, Sir Richard Birnie ; a Secretary, James Ab bott ; a Physician, and fifty Midwives. King (George III.), by the Marquess of Buckingham, as President of the Society, it met with his Slajesty's entire approba tion, and permission that H. R. H. the Duke of Kent should be Patron. In Slarch, 1809, the leading members of this society effected a junction with the before mentioned \" Irish Charitable Society,\" which had an unemployed capital of nearly eleven hundred pounds South Sea Annui ties, and the funds and benevolent duties of both societies were united. The anni versary dinner of the Society takes place on the 17th of Slarch, and I am happy to say, from my own knowledge, that by the prudent management and exaltedpatronage which it obtains, there is not a more useful and more flourishing institution in the metropolis. For many other interest ing particulars of this benevolent society, which are too long and too much in detail for this work, my readers are referred to Sir. Highmore's Pietas Londinensis. The building is on the south side of Stamford street, Blackfriars-road, and consists of a central edifice which contains the com mittee-room, office, residence of the master and mistress, and other necessary apart ments ; and two wings, one of which, the nearest to Waterloo-bridge, is the school room for boys, and the other, the nearest to Blackfriars'-bridge, is the school-room for girls. The entrance is in the centre under a portico of the Grecian Doric order, on the acroterium of which are the royal arms. It was erected from the designs, and under the superintendence of James Blountague, Esq., of Guildhall, one of the Surveyors of the City of London. Its present officers are the King, Patron; , President; the Blarquesses of Lansdowne and Downshire, the Earl of Glengall, Lord Downes, Lord Arthur Hill, SEP., Sir John Doyle, Bart., Sir Henry Parnell, Bart., SEP., and Charles Brownlow, Esq., SEP., Vice Presidents ; Edward T. Bainbridge, Esq., Treasurer ; and James Charles Blitchell, Esq., 18, Queen-square, Bloomsbury, Secretary. BENEVOLENT SOCIETY OF BLUES, is, as its name imports, a charitable asso- ciation of persons educated at the Bluecoat School, or Christ's Hospital, for the relief of their distressed school-fellows, their widows and orphans. The society is held at No. 11, Basinghall-street. Henry Woodthorpe, Esq., LL.D., the Town-clerk of London, is the President. BENEVOLENT SOCIETY OF St. PATRICK, Stamford-street, Blackfriars- road. This society was established, and is supported by the voluntary subscriptions of noblemen and gentlemen, who are either natives of Ireland, descendants of natives, connected by property, ties of blood, the high offices they have filled, or alliances with families of that kingdom, for the relief of the poor and distressed Irish residing in and about London, and that of their children, without any regard to the tenets or mode of worship of the objects. It being a fundamental maxim and un- alterable rule of this charity, that no reli- gious distinction whatever is to prevail in its execution.* In the year 1 704, the Irish Charitable Society was established, and continued its operation till the year 1756, when it ceased to meet. From that time to the institu tion of the present society, the poor and distressed Irish had no public charity in the British metropolis. The consideration that the capital must be the resort of poor people from all parts of the kingdom, in duced several classes of his Slajesty's sub jects resident in London, the Scotch and Welch in particular, to institute under chartered authorities, public charities for the relief of the distressed natives of their respective countries. Influenced by such motives, a considerable number of the before-mentioned classes of Irish Society, met on the 17th of Slarch, St. Patrick's Day, 1784, and formed themselves into a body, under the name of \" The Bene volent Society of St. Patrick,\" and immediately opened a subscription for the purpose of carrying their charitable intentions into execution.

This church is of very ancient foundation, and appears from the registry of Diceto, Dean of St. Paul's, under the year 1181. Its distinguishing epithet has been frequently changed, having been called, at various times, St. Bennet Huda, and St. Bennet, AVood-wharf, as well as by its present appellation. The ancient church on this site having been destroyed by the fire of London in 1 666, the present building was erected inits stead by Sir Christopher AVren, who finished it in 1683. It is a plain brick structure, with stone architraves to the windows, and festoons over them. The tower is at the corner, and is surmounted by a small cu pola and spire, the finial of which is 118 feet from the ground. The interior is nearly square, being fifty-four feet long, and fifty broad, by thirty-six in height. Since the fire, the church is also paro- chial for the parish of St. Peter, Paul's AVharf, anciently denominated St. Peter's Parva, from the smallness of its dimen- sions, and to which it is united, the church of which was also destroyed at the same time. It is a rectory, and as the patronage of both parishes appear to have been always in the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's, it still remains in that body. The present rector is the Rev. Henry Ducane, who was instituted by the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's in 1824. BENNET'S ALSIS riOUSES, St. Peter's- hill, Upper Thames-street, are a few doors on the left hand from Thames-street. St. BENNET'S, GRASS-CHURCH, or GRACECHURCH, the church of, is situated at the south-west comer of Fen- church-street and Gracechurch-street, nearly opposite Lombard-street. It derives its name from its dedication to St. Bene- dict, or Bennet, and its vicinity to the Grass-market, which was anciently held before its western door. The old church was destroyed by the great fire in 1660, and rebuilt by Sir Christopher AArren. It is a handsome church, and of the harmonious proportions of a double cube, being sixty feet in length, thirty in breadth, and thirty-two in height, the two feet in height being allowed by our great master to compensate for optical defect. It is richly ornamented after the fashion of the day, has handsome moulded wainscot pews, carved pulpit and altar, and a richly carved font. It was finished for divine service in 1685. The exterior is finished by a handsome cornice, a. lofty blocking course, and light balustrade. The tower begins from the ground, hke all of AA'ren's, and the tower above it is lofty and obeliscal, beginning from five small porticoes, and finishing with a ball and vane. The Church of St. Leonard, Eastcheap, was also destroyed at the same time, and the present church is now the parochial church of the two united parishes. It is a rectory, the patronage of which appears to have remained in the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's ; but as the patronage of the rectory of St. Leonard was anciently in the Priors and Convent of Canterbury, and since the Reformation, in the Dean and Chapter of that see, of which it is one of the thirteen peculiars within the City, the presentation is alternately with St. Paul's and Canterbury. The present rector is the Rev. George Gaskin, D.D. a prebendary of Ely, who was instituted by the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's in 1791. St. BENNET or St. BENEDICT FINK, the Church of, is situated on the south side of Threadneedle-street, and derives its name and addition from having been dedicated to St. Benedict, an Italian saint, who was founder of the order of Benedic- tine monks, and from having been rebuilt by one Robert Fink or Finch, whose name is also borne by a neighbouring lane. It is of ancient origin, and though at present only a curacy, was formerly a rectory, John de Brakentree being rector thereof before the year 1333. The old church, having been destroyed by the great fire in 1666, the present edifice was erected by Sir Christopher AVren, in its stead. The church, although a fine specimen of its author's genius, is scarcely so well known to the public as the celebrated vender of biscuits and fancy bread next door. It is built of stone, in an elliptical form, sixty- three feet in length, and forty-eight in width. It is covered by an elliptical cu- pola, surmounted by a glazed lantern St. BENNET'S, Paul's Wharf, Upper Thames-street, the Church of, is situated at the south-west cornerof St. Bennet's-hill, Doctors'-commons, and Upper Thames- street.

The interior is wainscotted seven feet high, with fine Dutch wainscot, is well pewed after the manner of English churches, and has a handsome carved pulpit, and desks, of the same description of wood. The altar-piece is in a handsome bold style, and well carved. The tower is square, built of Portland stone, and covered with a cupola and turret. The patronage of this church was for merly in the noble family of the Nevils ; but falling to the crown in the reign of Edward IV., that king gave it to the Dean and Chapter of AVindsor. The impropria tion is still in the said dean and chapter, who generally supply it with one of their own canons, who is licensed by the Bishop of London. The present curate is the Rev. C. R. Ashfield, who was instituted by the Dean and Chapter in 1818. St. BENNET'S-HILL, Upper Thames- street, is the second turning on the left hand from Earl-street, Blackfriars, and leads into Godliman-street, Doctors' Com- mons, and St. Paul's church-yard.

In the year 1323, it went by the name of St. Osyth's, subsequently corrupted to Sythes, and next to Size, from its being dedicated to a queen and martyr of that name. But she was divested of the tutelage of this church by Benedict Shorne, a fishmonger of London, who rebuilt and otherwise benefited it. He dedicated it to the saint whose name he bore, and his surname, being corrupted into Shrog, became, sub- sequently, Sherehog. The ancient church shared the fate of its neighbours in 1666, and not being rebuilt, was united by act of parliament to the parish of Stephen's, AValbrook [See St. Stephen's,Wal- BHOOK.

This royal hospital for lunatics, is one of the five royal hospitals mentioned in the account of St. Bartholomew. It is situated in St. George's-Fields, Lambeth, on a spot formerly celebrated as the Dog and Duck Tea Gardens, whence it was removed from Bloorfields about fourteen years ago, having in ancient times stood on the spot now called Old Bethlem, in Bishopsgate- street.

It extends to Charles-street opposite the Bliddlesex Hospital, and is about one-sixth of a mile in length. The original building was formerly a priory founded in the year 1247, by Simon Fitzroy, of London, or, according to Stow, Simon Fitz-BIary, Sheriff of London in the year 1 247- the thirty-first year of Henry III., on the east side of the Bloor, near Finsbury, from which it was divided by a large and deep ditch. This priory he endowed by deed of gift, with lands not far from it, on which the street now called Old Bethlem stands. A copy of this deed may be found in the second volume of Blaitland's History of London, page 796. He received from Edward HE, in the fourteenth year of his reign, the grant of his licence, and protec tion for the brethren \" Militia beat\u0153 Mari\u0153 de Bethlem,\" within the City of London.

It does not appear whether the society was ever very numerous, but Cam den says, in his third volume (Gough's Edition), page 22, that in the year 1403, it was reduced to the master only. At the suppression of monasteries by Henry VIIE, Sir John Gresham, Lord Blayor of London, petitioned for it with success ; for in 1547 the king granted its lands and revenues to the corporation of London, for the reception and maintenance of lunatics. In 1549 he followed it up by granting letters patent to John AA'hitehead, proctor of the hospital, to solicit and receive donations within the counties of Lincoln and Cambridge, the city of London and the Isle of Ely ; and at a court of aldermen in the reign of Edward VI. it was ordered, that the precinct of Bethlem should be thenceforth united to the parish of St. Bo tolph without Bishopsgate. The number of its unfortunate patients having increased, and the ancient buildings of the priory having become much dilapi dated, it was found necessary to remove it to a more spacious site, and to enlarge its accommodations. This necessary work was began in April 1644, and the corporation of London allotted a large piece of ground on the south side of Bloorfields, on the north side of London-wall, for this pur pose. The building was began and com pleted by voluntary contributions in 1676, at an expense of \u00a317,000. The design is said to have been copied from the palace of the Tuilleries at Paris, and that Louis XIV. was so much offended by it, that he ordered a copy of our king's palace of St. James's to be taken for offices of a very humble kind. In 1708 Queen Anne granted the corporation a license to pur chase and hold in fee, or for lives, or years, or otherwise, in trust for this hospital, any lands, &c. to the value of \u00a32,000 a year. The increase of application, as there was no limitation, from all parts of the king dom, rendered a farther enlargement neces sary, therefore in 1733 two wings were added, which enabled the governors to maintain one hundred incurable patients. When these buildings were finished, the length of the hospital was 540 feet, and its breadth 40 feet. This hospital being united by the charter of Edward VI. to that of Bridewell, as mentioned in the account of St. Bartholo mew's Hospital, it is conducted by the same governors, being members of the corpora- tion, and others who become so by bene factions, as will be more particularly stated in the account of Bridewell, which see. The management is confided to a committee of forty-two governors, seven of whom, with the treasurer, physician, and other officers, attend every Saturday in monthly rotation for the admission of patients and other bu siness of the hospital ; and these meetings are open for the attendance of any other governor. By the agreement and act of parliament of 1782, alluded to in the account of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, the style of this hospital was settled to be \" The Blayor, Commonalty and Citizens of London, as Blasters, Guardians and Governors of the House and Hospital called Bethlem, situate without and near to Bishopsgate, of the said City of London.\" This style is of course altered, so far as concerns its situa tion. The antiquity and consequent decay of the old building in Bloorfields, rendered an expensive repair, or total re-building necessary. The corporation, after due de- liberation, finally determined to build a new hospital in a more proper situation ; and as the leases of the Bridge-house estates in St. George's-fields and Lambeth-marsh fell in at Lady-day 1810, the governors agreed with the Bridge-house committee for a ground plot of nearly twelve acres, fronting the high road leading from New- ington to Westminster-bridge, on part of which were the house and gardens of the notoriously infamous Dog and Duck. On a portion of this ground they have erected the new hospital, from the designs and under the superintendence of the late Sir. Lewis, their architect. Of these twelve acres, eight are occupied by the hospital, its airing grounds and kitchen garden. The other four are turned to profit other ways, as the act of parliament restrains the governors to the use of eight. This new building is of great extent and magnificence, and much more like a palace than that which is said to have excited the jealousy of Louis le Grand. It was began in 1812, and the patients removed into it and the old hospital pulled down in 1814. The new hospital is really a magnificent structure, consisting of a centre and two wings extending along the principal front to the length of 580 feet. The centre, which projects from the main body, has a hexastyle portico of the Ionic order, which supports a handsome pediment. The wings also project, and are in harmonious accord-"], [74, "BET 58 BET BETHNAL-GREEN, is a village, or large green, situated about a mile to the east- ward of Shoreditch, and about half a mile northward of the Turnpike at Mile End, up the Cambridge New-road, formerly called the Dog-row. Bethnal-green was formerly one of the hamlets of the large parish of Stepney, from which it was sepa- rated by act of parliament of the 13th George II. The old Roman way from London led through the hamlet, where joining the military way from the west, it passed with it to Lea Ferry, at Old Ford. In this place, Bonner, the infamous Bishop of London, had his palace, and a row of houses, altered from it, is still called Bon- ner's-hall.

In the great hall under the portico are preserved the two celebrated statues of raving and melancholy madness, by Caius Cibber, that were formerly on the gate piers of the late hospital in Bloorfields. The buildings and inclosures are said to have cost nearly \u00a3100,000, and are capable of accommodating some hundreds of patients. Its annual income is about \u00a318,000.

The trustees, with some savings, made an advantageous purchase of a piece of ground, called Cambridge Heath, in the parish, near the Hackney-road, let it on building leases for ninety-five years, at a ground rent of \u00a343 a year ; and have also a stock of \u00a3550 South Sea Annuities. AArith these funds they educate and partly clothe fifty boys. The schoolmaster has \u00a350 a year and coals ; the six alms men, \u00a35 a year each, and coals. A subscription school has been likewise established in the same pa rish, to which various benefactions have been given to the amount of \u00a31,200, as appears from the tables in the church.

It is a large fish market, public wharf and landing place. The earliest notice of this market or water gate is in Dr. Howel's History of the AA'orld (vol. iii. part 4, chap. 2) under the date of a. d. 979, about which time Ethelred made laws at AA'antage for the regulation of the customs on ships and merchandize, to be paid at Blynesgate or Billingsate in the Port of London, then the only quay. This little haven was for a great length of time the most important place in the metropolis, for the landing of almost every article of commerce after Queenhithe was forsaken. \u2014 (See Queenhithe.) But it did not become celebrated as a fish-market till the year 1699, when an act of par- liament was passed, making it a free port and market for the sale offish, six days in every week, with permission to sell mac- kerell on Sundays, before and after divine service ; and for permitting the resale of the fish purchased there in every part of the city or elsewhere by retail, but no fish- monger or other person, is to engross or buy more than shall be for his own sale or use, under the penalty of \u00a320.

It is bounded on the south by the Ward of Langbourn, on the west by that of Broad- street, on the east by those of Aid gate and Portsoken, and part of the liberty of the Tower, and on the north by the parish of Shoreditch, being itself the most northern of the city wards. The principal buildings in this ward, are the parish churches of St. Botolph AVithout Bishops gate, St. Ethelburga, and Great St. Helens ; Leathersellers' Hall, the Excise Office, and the London AA'orkhouse.

BISHOPSGATE St.-AVITHOUT, is the north continuation of the last ; it extends from Camomile-street and AArormwood- street to Norton Falgate. Its total length is about half a mile. This street gives its name to the ward in which it is situated, and derives its own from the ancient gate that formerly stood across the street, a little northward of AVormwood-street and Camomile-street. Its site is still marked by a sculptured mitre against the house. Strype, the historian, imagines that Bishops-gate was erected by Erkenwald, Bishop of London, about the year 675, a conjecture founded only on the effigies of two bishops, sculptured on the ancient gate. Stow, however, could find no men- tion of this gate earlier than 1210, when William Blound, one of the Sheriffs of London, sold his land and gardens without Bishopsgate to the wardens of London- bridge. As Bishopsgate-street escaped the ravages of the great fire in 1666, there are several remains of the ancient domestic BISHOPSGATE PAROCHIAL CHA- RITY SCHOOLS for the parish of St. BOTOLPH, ore in Bishopsgate-street AVithout.

It was formerly a monas- tery of Dominicans, called the Convent of the Black Friars, or Friar preachers, founded about the year 1276, by Robert Kilwarby, Archbishop of Canterbury, by licence from Edward I. It was built with the stones taken from the Tower of Blount Fitchet, and from a part of the city wall, that was pulled down to make way for the new building. This produced an order from the king to the citizens of London, to build a new wall with a tower at the head of it for his reception. This wall run from Ludgate westward, behind the houses on Ludgate-hill to the Fleet-ditch, and thence southward to the river Thames ; for the completion of which works his majesty granted the city a duty on certain mer- chandize.

Edward I. and his Queen Eleanor were great benefactors to the new convent, and by their aid the archbishop erected the monastery, a fine mansion and a large church. He kept his charters and records here, and in his time the precinct was crowded with habitations of the nobility. The priory church was very large, and in it were held several parliaments and other great meetings. In 1529 the Cardinals Campeius and AArolsey sat here to annul the marriage of Henry VIIE with Catha rine of Arragon ; and in the month of October in the same year, the parliament which condemned AVolsey in a pr\u0153munire assembled here. This precinct was very extensive, and was surrounded by a wall with four gates, and contained a great num ber of shops, the occupiers of which were allowed to carry on their trades, although not free of tho city. These privileges were maintained, even after the dissolution of the monasteries, for when the Lord Blayor interfered in behalf of his freemen, Henry VIII. sent him word, that he was as well BLACK BULL-ALLEY, Whitechapel, is about a furlong on the right up Bliddlesex- street, formerly Petticoat-lane, from No. 41, Aldgate High-street; or from AA'hitechapel, about ten houses south from AArentworth- street, and leads into Goulston-street.

In the fourth year of his reign Edward VI. granted the whole monastery, with all its lands and tenements, to Sir Thomas Cawarden. After this time the inhabitants fitted up a portion of the church for their parochial use, with various alterations, till it was completely destroyed by the great fire in 1666, when the present church was erected in its stead \u2014 [See St. Anne's, Blackfriars, the church of.] \u2014 Within this ancient precinct also stands, on the east side of AArater-lane, the hall, warehouses, and offices of the Apothecaries' Com pany. \u2014 [See Apothecaries' Hall. In consequence of the inhabitants of this precinct claiming, in the year 1735, a privilege of exemption from the jurisdic tion of the City of London, in right of the ancient monastery being dissolved there by Henry VIIE, the Lord Blayor and Alder men determined to ascertain their right thereto, which they did by a trial in the Court of King's Bench, on the 10th July, of that year. John Bosworth, Esq., Chamberlain of the City, was plaintiff, and Daniel AAratson, shalloon and drugget seller, defendant. The action was brought against the latter, for opening a shop in Blackfriars, and retailing his goods there, without being a freeman of the city. The counsel for the plaintiff alleged that Blackfriars actually belonged to the City of London, when it was a monastery, and before trades were ever used there. To prove this allegation they produced several ancient records, namely, a charter of King Edward I.,* and a record of the 2nd of Richard II., calling it \" the Friary of London ;\" and another of the 21st of Henry VIIE, dated November 3, 1530, mentioning a parliament held at the Friars, preachers of the City of London, and other records of a similar nature. They like wise cited a parallel case to this in the 15th Charles I., when an action was brought against one Philpot, a shoemaker of Black friars, for opening a shop and vending shoes there, without being free of the City. The result was, that after a fair trial, by an equal and indifferent jury, taken from the county of Herts, a verdict was given for the plain tiff, with five shillings damages.

BLACKFRIARS'-BRIDGE, unites the two shores of the City of London in Bliddlesex, and in Surrey, from the south end of New Bridge-street, at Chatham- place, to a corresponding square on the Surrey side, called Albion-place (see those two places). The first proposition for building a bridge over this part of the Thames, was made in the court of com- mon-council in the year 1753, when there were only two bridges over the Thames in the metropolis ; namely, those called AA'est- minster and London. The corporation therefore procured an act of parliament in 1756, by which they were empowered to build this bridge, and to perform all other necessary acts for its accomplishment. They proposed a com petition, and selected the design of Robert Blylne, Esq., a young architect, who was then pursuing his studies in Rome. This bridge is erected on piles, the first of which was driven under one of the cen tre piers, on the 7th of June 1 760, by the Lord Blayor, Sir Thomas Chitty, who depo sited, as is usual on such occasions, a series of coins and a plate, on which was engraved a Latin inscription commemorative of the circumstance, and of the public virtues of AVilliam Pitt, the first Earl of Chatham, after whom the bridge was named Pitt bridge, and the quadrangle at its northern foot, Chatham-place. This inscription called forth a critical squib, entitled \" City Latin ; or Critical and Political Remarks on the Latin Inscription on laying the First Stone of the intended New Bridge, at Blackfriars,\" which went through several editions. It was answered by \" Plain English, in answer to City Latin, &c, by a Deputy.\" Both the pamphlets are in the library of the Corporation at Guildhall. Blackfriars'-bridge was opened to the public in 1770, with a series of tolls, but the toll-houses were burnt by the rioters in 1780. It consists of nine elliptical arches, the piers of which are decorated by Ionic columns, of various heights, and the upper part by a cornice and balustrade. The * See Norton's Commentaries, Art.

BOROUGH OF SOUTHAA'ARK, The, is a considerable part of the British metro- polis, which may be considered as consist- ing of the city of London, the city of Westminster, and the borough of South- wark, with their respective suburbs. South- wark, or, as it is more familiarly called, the Borough, lies entirely on the south side of the Thames, and in the county of \u25a0 Surrey. It consists of the parishes of St. Olave, St. Thomas, St. Saviour, St. George and St. John, and for its geographical extent, and for the number and respecta- bility of its inhabitants, is inferior to few cities in England. It is mentioned by some authors, that Southwark was known as a place of trade with the Romans, before London, which arose from it. The earliest known ac- count of this borough is in the reign of Edward the Confessor, about the year 1053, when Earl Godwin arrived there without opposition, and passed London bridge, in order to engage the royal navy, consisting of fifty ships of war, then lying off Westminster ! BOROUGH HAY-B1ARKET is at No. 33, Bridge-house-row, Stones'-end. Southwark was governed by its own bailiff till 1327, when the mayor of Lon- don was constituted bailiff of Southwark, and empowered to govern it by his deputy. Some few years after this, the inhabitants recovered their ancient privileges ; but in the fourth year of Edward ArE the crown made a second grant of it to the City for a valuable consideration, and it became a nominal ward under the title of Bridge Ward AVithout. That part of the Borough of Southwark which is subject to the city of London, is called the Borough Liberty, and is under the government of a high bailiff and other officers. [See Borough- court.] The other division is called the Liberty of the Clink, and belongs to the Bishop of AAlnchester, who appoints a steward and bailiff to govern this district. The extent of this borough is from London bridge, southward, to Newington ; to the south west, almost to Lambeth ; to Rother hithe in the east ; and by the Thames on the north. Its principal streets are the BOROUGH HIGH-St [See High- street, Southwark. BOROUGH HOP-BIARKET is at No. 14, Weston-street, Southwark. BOROUGH-S1ARKET, a very consider- able market for all sorts of provisions, but principally fruit and vegetables, is situated at the west end of York-street, going from High-street, about one-sixth of a mile from London-bridge, on the right.

In 1733 the Company erected a marble statue of their benefactor, by Rysbrack, in the centre of the garden. In the gardens are spacious conservatories and green-houses, a library of botanical books, and a museum of dried plants. On the south side are two cedars of Libanus, that were planted in 1685, being then three feet high. In 1793 the girt of the larger at three feet from the ground was nearly thirteen feet, and that of the smaller more than twelve feet. In January 1809, both these fine trees suffered very severely from a heavy fall of snow, which broke off several of their limbs, and otherwise much injured them. The exotics growing in these gardens are of the choicest description. [For the names of the super intendants of the gardens, see Apothe caries' Hall.

This is distinct from Sir John Cass's school at the corner of Aldgate [See Cass's School], and was the first Protestant parochial charity school established in London. It is also the first in London which adopted the national system of education that has been attended with such great success. This parish is very extensive, and stands without as well as within the boundaries of the city. The latter district is called the Freedom, and the former the Lordship, being manorial ; but the children are chosen from both districts, and the school is managed by trustees resident in both. The former school-house having become ruinous, a voluntary subscription was raised in 1792, sufficient to purchase the freehold on which the present school stands, and to pay for its erection. They educate and clothe 60 boys and 40 girls. Information relative to the school may be obtained from the Rev. Dr. Hollingsworth, the rector, or of the master of the school at the school- house.

When Sir Hans Sloane, who had studied botany in these gardens, purchased the manor of Chelsea in 1721, he granted the freehold of the premises to the Company, on condition that they should present an- nually to the Royal Society, fifty specimens of different sorts of plants, well dried and BOTOLPH - ALLEY, Lower Thames- street, is the last turning on the right in Botolph-lane going from Thames-street, nearly opposite Billingsgate, to Eastcheap. St. BOTOLPH, Aldersgate, the church of, is situated at the south-east corner of Little Britain, in Aldersgate-street AA'ithout, and received its name from St. Botolph, a Bri-"], [91, "75 BOT BOT tish saint born in Cornwall, and from its contiguity to the ancient Alder's gate. Although the fire in 1 666 did not reach the ancient church, yet it* was so decayed that a part of it was rebuilt in 1757, and farther repaired and beautified in 1829. It was anciently a rectory, the advowson of which was in the dean and canons of St. Blartin's-le-Grand, but being for some time unappropriated, Richard II., in 1399, gave the income to the dean for a perpetual anniversary for his deceased consort Queen Anne. In 1593 Henry VII. annexed the collegiate church of St. Slartin-le-Grand, with all its appurtenances, to the convent of St. Peter, AA'estminster ; but at the sup pression of monasteries it was granted by Henry VIIE to his new bishop of AVest minster. That bishopric having been dis solved by Queen BIary, and the abbot and monks restored to their convent, this church reverted to its old masters ; but when the monks were finally expelled, and the con vent converted into a collegiate church by authority of parliament in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, she granted the curacy to the dean and chapter of Westminster, in whom it still remains, subject however to the bishop and archdeacon of London, to whom it pays procuration. The advow- son is a perpetual curacy, held by the Rev. Thomas H. Causton, who was instituted by the aforesaid dean and chapter in 1821. granted by James I. to Francis Blorrice, from whom it descended to several others, and the impropriation has' ever since con tinued in private hands. It is now a perpetual curacy, of which Robert Kynaston, Esq., is the patron, who instituted the Rev. J. B. Hollings worth, D.D., Archdeacon of Huntingdon in 1824. St. BOTOLPH'S, Billingsgate, the church of, was formerly in Lower Thames-street. The ancient church of this parish having been destroyed by the great fire of 1666, was not rebuilt, but the parish was by act of parliament united to that of St. George, Botolph-lane \u2014 [See St. George, Bo- tolph-lane, the church of. St. BOTOLPH, Bishopsgate, the church of, is situated on the west side of Bishops- gate-street AAlthout, and nearly opposite the western end of Houndsditch. The ancient church of this name was of very ancient foundation, and received its name from the before-mentioned Anglo Saxon Saint, who died about the year 680. The first authentic account of this church is in 1323, when John de Northampton resigned the rectorship, which then was, and still is, in the gift of the Bishop of London. The old church which stood upon the bank of the ancient city ditch escaped the fire of London, but became so ruinous that it was taken down in 1726, and rebuilt from the designs of the elder George Dance. It was finished in 1729, and is a spacious, substantial, and well built struc- ture. The spire is peculiarly handsome, and with that of Shoreditch, by the same architect, among the best since the days of AVren. The east end, which is next the street, is decorated with Doric pilasters, and a large window, with entrance doors at the sides, which excited much criticism at the time of its completion. It arises from the circumstance of the necessity (so then conceived) of placing the altar always at the east end, which, in this instance, deprived the principal front of the advan- tage of a grand central door. The living is a rectory in the gift of the king and the Bishop of London, and the present incum- bent is the Hon. and Rev. E. Grey, who was instituted by the King in 1828. St. BOTOLPH, Aldgate, the church of, is situated at the south-east corner of Hounds- ditch, and nearly opposite the Blinories, in Aldgate High-street. It is one of the four churches in London dedicated by our ancestors to their favourite saint, Botolph the Briton. The old church, which was rebuilt by the prior and canons of the Holy Trinity, a short time before the dissolution of that convent, escaped the fire in 1666 ; but it had become so ruinous in 1741, that it was taken down and the present edifice finished in 1744. It is built principally with brick, and is a plain, bold and massive structure, consisting of a regular formed body and a lofty spire on a rusticated tower. This church was a rectory of very an ancient foundation, the patronage of which was in the proprietors of Portsoken AArard, who, in 1115, gave it to the prior and convent of the Holy Trinity. At the dissolution of that priory, it was seized by the crown, and in 1577 Queen Elizabeth gave it to Robert Holliwell for a term of years ; at the expiration of which it was BOTOLPH-ALLEY, is a turning at No. 40, in Botolph-lane, Lower Thames- street.

This church is a fabric of great strength and beauty, and forms one of the most striking features of the metropolis. Its interior is spacious, commodious and ele gant, being one hundred and eleven feet in length, fifty-seven in breadth, and forty one in height ; is remarkably well pewed, with moulded wainscot, and is composed of a lofty nave, covered with a vaulted ceiling, and two aisles, separated by cou pled columns of the Doric order. The old church was so much damaged by the fire of 1G66, that it was taken down and entirely rebuilt by Sir Christopher AVren, who completed it for divine service in 1C80, and further embellished it in 1699. The tower and steeple were began in October 1701, and completed in 1703. The church has since that time undergone several expensive repairs, and has been recently restored and beautified in a manner de serving its great reputation, and creditable to the munificence of the parishioners. This church appears to be of considera ble antiquity, as there are records of three rectors previous to 1362. It was a very small building, till about 1480, when it was greatly enlarged by AVilliam Arenor, who erected a spacious fabric at its west end, which consisted of a nave and two aisles, to which the ancient church served as a choir. In 1610, the Earl of Dorset gave a large piece of ground on the west side of Fleet Ditch, for a new burial ground, and it was consecrated the 2d of August, of that year, by Dr. George Abbott, Bishop of London. This cemetery, which is behind the west side of Farringdon-street, is still used for that purpose. It was originally a rectory in the patronage of the Abbot and Convent of AVestminster, and is supposed to have been converted into a vicarage about the year 1529. AVhen Henry VIII. dissolved the Convent of AVestminster and formed it into a bishoprick, this church was conferred upon the new Bishop, and restored to the Abbot by his daughter, Mary, but on the restoration of the deanery by Edward IV., the patronage was granted to the Dean and Chapter, in whom it still continues. The present vicar is the Rev. Joseph Allen, D.D., Prebendary of AVest minster, and Vicar of Battersea. He was instituted by the Dean and Chapter in 1829. BRICKLAYERS' ARMS, Kent-road, a well known Coach and Booking-office, is at the east end of Kent-street, about two- thirds of a mile from St. George's church, and near the same distance from the Ele- phant and Castle. BRICKLAYERS' - HALL, Leadenhall- street, is up a court, behind No. 53, in that street, and is now used as a Syna- gogue for Dutch Jews. The Company appears to be very ancient, yet it was not incorporated till the reign of Queen Eliza- beth, who, by letters patent, dated the 3d August 1568, incorporated them, by the name of \" The Master and Keepers or Wardens of the Society of Freemen of the Mystery or Art of Tylers and Bricklayers of London.\" BRICK-St., Piccadilly, is the first turning on the left in Engine-street, a few yards from Piccadilly ; it leads to No. 14, Down- street. BRICK St., Southwark, is the third turning on the left from the King's Bench Prison, going towards the Obelisk ; it leads to St. George's-market and Newington-road or Causeway. St. BRIDE'S AVENUE, Fleet-street, is a handsome new opening, that leads to St. Bride's church, and opens to public view its majestic spire. This great improve- ment arose from the circumstance of a fire which took place on the night of the 14th of November, 1824, and destroyed all the houses from the corner of St. Bride's- passage, a narrow alley now built upon, by the side of Messrs. Davenport and Co's. china-warehouse. The present Avenue was formed in its stead, and leads up to the principal entrances of the church, instead of the former narrow and incon- venient passage. The design for the ave- nue and the new houses, on both sideE, was prepared by J. B. Papworth, Esq. The ground was purchased by a public subscription, to which the late John Blades, Esq., of Ludgate-hill, contributed a very large sum, amounting, it is said, to no less than \u00a36,000 or \u00a37,000. The inhabitants contributed liberally, as did the present Archbishop of Canterbury, (Dr. Howley) who was then Bishop of London, For more detailed particulars of this Avenue, and its history, the reader is referred to \" London in the Nineteenth Century,\" by the Editor of this Dictionary, p. 237.

On the site of this building stood, in ancient times, even before the Norman invasion, a royal palace wherein King John subsequently held his court. AVithin the precincts of this royal residence was a well of the purest water, dedicated, as was the practice of the ancient church of Rome, to St. Bridget or St. Bride, and which gave its name to the precinct, the parish and the church. This spot was part of the arx palalina, which stood near the river Fleet. The palace of Bridewell was rebuilt by Henry VIII., in 1522, for the reception of the Emperor Charles V., and it con- tinued as a royal residence, with few inter- missions, till the reign of Edward VI. who presented it, in 1553, to the mayor, com- monalty and citizens of London, to be a working house for the poor and idle per- sons of the city. This building was almost totally destroyed by the fire of 1666, and was rebuilt in 1668. It contains a hall, in which is a painting of Edward VI. delivering its charter to Sir George Barnes, the Lord Mayor, a chapel, a prison and other buildings. The affairs of this hospi- tal are governed by the same committee that manages Bethlem, to which it is united as one of the five royal hospitals of the city, and its president and other officers are the same [See Bethlem Hospi- tal. BRIDGE-HOUSE, Southwark, is an estate consisting of store-houses &c. in Bridge- house-yard, Tooley-street, belonging to the corporation of London.

Among these he gave him the barony of Little Dunmow, which being forfeited to the Crown in 1 1 1 1, by the trai- torous practices of AVilliam Baynard, his successor, was given, together with the honours of Baynard Castle, by Henry I., to Gilbert, Earl of Clare, and his succes- sors. From this nobleman, it descended in the female line, to Robert Fitzwalter, Castellan and Banner-bearer of London, in 1213. King John, making criminal over- tures to the Castellan's daughter, aroused him and his brother barons, who made war upon the king, but being defeated, Fitz- walter and his more immediate associates were banished, Baynard's Castle, and two other dwellings belonging to him were demolished, and his daughter, Matilda the Fair, for rejecting the tyrant's unlawful suit, was poisoned. John afterwards in- vaded France in 1214, with a powerful army, when a- truce was made between the kingsof England and France for five years. There being a river or arm of the sea be- tween the rival armies, an English knight called to those on the French side, and challenged any one to come over and take a joust or two with him. Robert Fitzwalter, who was with the French army, ferried over, and mounting his steed, accepted the challenge. At the first course he struck his adversary so violently with his long spear, that both man and horse fell to the ground. Fitzwalter's spear having been broke by the concussion, he returned to the French king. John exclaimed, \" By God's tooth,\" his usual oath, \" he were a king indeed who had such a knight;\" and on being informed it was his injured subject, Fitzwalter, he concluded a peace with France, restored the Castellan to his ho- nours and estates, and gave him permis- sion to rebuild his castle of Baynard. This brave baron died in 1234, and was buried in Dunmow. He was succeeded by his son Walter, who dying and leaving his son under age, it fell under the ward- ship of King Henry, who reclaimed them formally in 1303, before John Blount, then Mayor of London. The ancient castle was destroyed by fire in 1428, aud was rebuilt by Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester.

St. CATHERINE, or KATHERINE CREE, the church of, is situated at the south-east angle of Cree church-lane, in Leadenhall-street. It is dedicated to the same virgin saint and martyr as the pre- ceding, and is distinguished from other churches of the same name by the addition of Cree, the ancient English method of spelling Christ, as pronounced by the French, having been built on the site of a dissolved priory, whose church was called that of our Saviour Christ. They, there- fore, dedicated it to St. Catherine, and added the original name of the priory by way of distinction. Henry VIII., in his grant of the priory to Sir Thomas, after- wards Lord Audley, gave him also the patronage of the church. Upon the death of this nobleman he bequeathed it to the Master and Fellows of Magdalene College, Cambridge, and their successors, whom he enjoined to serve the cure for ever. That corporation leased out the impropria- tion to the parish for 99 years ; but a dis- pute arising between the College and the parish at the expiration of the said lease in 1725, about a renewal, a lease was granted to Jerome Knapp, Esq., a citizen and haberdasher of London, and an agreement, which was confirmed by act of parliament in 1727, was entered into concerning a commutation in lieu of tithes.

St. CATHERINE, or KATHERINE, COLEMAN, the church of, is situated on the east side of Church-row, on the south side of Fenchurch-street, about ten houses eastward of Mark-lane, with which it also communicates. It derives its name and addition from being dedicated to St. Katherine, a virgin and martyr of Alex- andria, and from being situated on a spot anciently called Coleman Haw. It is a very ancient rectory, as there are records of its being so in 1346. The old church was substantially repaired, and a south aisle added in 1489, by Sir AVilliam AVhite, then Lord Mayor of London. It escaped the great fire of 1666; but being very much out of repair, and much buried by the raising of the causeway in Fen- church-street, it was pulled down in 1734, and the present church erected at the expense of the parish. It is a plain, well- built church, with a lofty nave, lighted with two rows of windows. The tower is The present structure was erected in 1630, it is built of stone in a mixed and impure style. The length of the body is ninety feet, the breadth fifty-one, and the height thirty-seven. Maitland, who appears to have been fol lowed by every successive writer that I have looked into, says that the church is a curacy, and that the parishioners have the privilege of electing their own minister, who must be licensed by the Bishop of London. But the Clerical Guide, which must be of authority, says that it is a vicarage, and still in the gift of the Master square, and finished with embrasures, and the floor of the church is elevated several steps above the level of its surrounding church-yard.

This street was the scene of the weak and wicked conspiracy, known by the name of the Cato-street conspiracy. This monstrous plot, which, for imbecility, is almost un- equalled, was discovered early in 1820, when nine persons, who had assembled \"with the intention of assassinating the whole of his Majesty's ministers, while assembled at a dinner party at Lord Harrowby's, were secured by Colonel Fitzclarence, and a small party of the police. The leader of the party, Thistlewood, was to have presented a red messenger's box at the door, to be delivered as a despatch, and while in waiting, was to have opened the door and let in the rest of his gang, who were to rush up stairs and murder them all. Several pistols, swords, and hand grenades, were found in the rooni where the conspirators assembled. Eleven of the conspirators were committed to the Tower, five of whom, Thistlewood, Tidd, Brunt, Ings and Davidson, were tried, convicted, and executed at the Old Bailey.

The chamberlain is usually elected from such of the aldermen as have passed the chair ; but such a qualification in the candidate is not absolutely necessary ; and such election is in the livery, at their annual common-hall on Midsummer day.

The office of Chamberlain of London was anciently vested in the crown, and appears to have been then, as well as now, a profitable office ; for, in 1204, AVilliame de St. Michael obtained it for a fine of one hundred pounds, and an annual rent of one hundred marks. This important office was held in 1696 by Sir Thomas Coddon, Knt., who was succeeded, in 1702, by Sir ATilliam Fazakerley, Knt. Sir George Ludlam, Knt. was elected in 1718 ; Samuel Robinson, Esq. in 1727 ; Sir John Bosworth, Knt. in 1734, when there was a severe contest between the partizans of the ministry and the independent members of the livery. The candidates were Mr. John Bosworth, a tobacconist, of Newgate-street; Mr. AVilliam Selwin, a silkman, in Pater noster-row ; and Mr. John Thomas, a fishmonger, near the Monument, who, having no shew of hands at the common hall, withdrew. The numbers, however, for the other two candidates appeared so equal, that a poll was demanded by the friends of Mr. Selwin against Mr. Bos worth, who was declared, by the sheriffs, to have the majority. Mr. Selwin having solicited the ministerial party to oblige all their dependants to vote for him, offended the independent liverymen, al though he had been previously as well respected by his fellow-citizens as his com petitor. The contest lasted seven days, and was the warmest then ever known, the citizens being determined to preserve their freedom of election against any ministerial influence. On the close of the poll, the numbers appeared so equal, that a scrutiny was demanded, and when the final declaration was made, it appeared that Mr. Bosworth's number was 3212, and Mr. Selwin's 3208. In consequence of which, to the great satisfaction of the independent part of the citizens, Mr. Bos worth was declared to be duly elected Chamberlain of the City of London, and was subsequently knighted by the king. The ministry, however, resented it, by taking away the office of receiver-general of the land tax from the Chamberlain, and con ferring it on their disappointed friend Mr. Selwin. This gentleman was succeeded in 1751 by Sir Thomas Harrison, Knt.. and in 1765 by Sir Stephen Theodore Jansen, Knt., who resigning his office in 1776, was succeeded by Benjamin Hop kins, Esq., after another very severe con- test. Aldermen AVilkes and Hopkins were put in nomination, and the shew of hands appearing greatly in favour of Mr. AVilkes, a poll was demanded by his oppo nent. At the close of the poll, the num bers were for Alderman Hopkins 2887, and for Alderman Wilkes 2710, and the former was of course declared duly elected. Alderman Hopkins resigned his gown as alderman of Broad-street AVard on the 15th of March, 1776, and on the following day Richard Clarke, Esq., the present (1830) Chamberlain, was unanimously elected in his stead. In 1779 another election occurred in the room of Mr. Hop kins, when Alderman AVilkes became can didate again, with a Mr. James, when the former was elected by a very great majority. On the death of AVilkes on the 20th of December, 1797, another vacancy occured, when at a common-hall, held on the 2nd of of January, 1798, Aldermen Sir AVatkin Lewes, and Richard Clarke, Esq., were proposed to the livery. On the shew of hands, there was a great majority in favour of the latter, but a poll being demanded, it commenced at half-past two and closed at four, when the numbers being 393 for Alderman Clarke, and 48 for Sir AVatkin Lewes, the latter declined, and Mr. Clarke was elected, and still holds his honourable situation, although beyond his ninetieth year, with credit to himself, and utility to his fellow citizens.

That queen, however, restored them to his family, and at the accession of James I., it was the residence of Lord Thomas Howard, second son of the above named duke ; who entertained that sovereign and his suite within its walls for four successive days. James created his host, Earl of Suffolk, Lord Chamberlain, and a knight of the garter, and made not less than four score knights. This Earl of Suffolk, who is memorable for his inordinate rapacity, sold the Char. treuse, in 1611, to Thomas Sutton, citizen and girdler, who immediately after his pur chase, instituted the present establishment. This eminent citizen, the founder of the modern Charter-house was born at Knaith, in Lincolnshire, in 1532, was educated at Eton, and studied the law at Lincoln's inn.

He built a chapel on part of the ground and named the place New- handsome fortune.

He was also a commissioner of prizes, and was successful in capturing a Spanish ship worth \u00a320,000. By these means, by marriage with a wealthy widow, by the purchase of some successful coal mines in Durham, and by his profits as a merchant, he became one of the wealthiest of the citizens of London. He lived magnifi cently and with great hospitality, but on the death of his wife, he retired into pri vate life, purchased this property and founded this establishment. He applied to the king, James I., for a charter, which he speedily obtained, being dated the 22d June 1611, about five weeks after his pur chase. The governors are incorporated by this instrument, as \" The Governors of the Lands, Possessions, Revenues and Goods of the Hospital of King James, founded in Charter-house, within the County of Mid dlesex, at the humble Petition and only Costs and Charges of Thomas Sutton, Esq.\" This benevolent man died on the 10th December 1611, at his residence in Hack ney. His body was embalmed, inclosed in a leaden coffin and kept in his house till May 1612, when it was removed to Christchurch, Newgate-street, for tempo rary interment, until the new chapel, then building at the hospital, was ready to receive it. CHARTER -HOUSE -LANE, St. John- street, is about twelve houses on the right hand from Smithfield, and leads into Char- ter-house-square.

It is said that he left a fortune of \u00a35,000 a year in land, and \u00a360,000 in money. The establishment was successfully car ried on till 1624, when the hospital sus tained a loss of \u00a38,000, and experienced great reverses during the civil wars in the reign of Charles I. In 1645 the parlia mentary army took possession of some of its estates. In 1652 Oliver Cromwell was elected governor, and was succeeded by his son Richard in 1658.

After the reformation it was mutilated and its statues destroyed; and in 1643, it was entirely destroyed and removed as a relic of popery by the puritanical parliament. This street gives its name to the ward wherein it is situated. The Ward of Cheap is bounded on the east by the wards of Broad -street and Walbrook, on the north by these of Bassishaw and Coleman street, on the west by those of Queenhithe and Cripplegate, and on the south by that of the Cordwainers. It extends from the corner of St. Mildred's-court in the Poul try, to near the comer of Milk-street, Cheapside, and from the west corner of the Mansion House, to within thirty feet of Bow-lane.

The principal buildings in this ward, are the parish churches of Mildred in the Poultry and St. Mary Colechurch, Guildhall, Mercers'-hall and chapel and Grocers'-hall [See these several streets and buildings. It is divided into nine municipal pre cincts, and is under the government of an alderman (AVilliani Thompson,Esq., M.P.) a deputy and eleven other common-council men, and other ward officers. CHATHAM, The Earl of, his Monu- ment in Guildhall, London, is on the north side of the hall, near the hustings. It consists of a group of colossal figures, in alto-relievo, or rather of entire statues in the round. The artist's intention, in the composition, is to convey an idea of the prosperity of the British nation under this eminent statesman. He has therefcre re- presented Lord Chatham in the dress of a Roman orator, as the pilot of the state, standing upon a rock, and resting upon a rudder, with his right arm supporting Commerce, who is seated by his side, at- tended by allegorical figures of the four quarters of the globe, pouring the con- tents of a horn of plenty into the lap of Britannia, who is seated upon her lion at the minister's feet. By the side of Bri- tannia is the City of London, represented by a female figure, crowned with laurels, appealing to the principal figure to protect her favourite, Commerce, whom he appears most willingly to adopt. The monument is by the elder Bacon, and has more freedom of style and lightness of execution, than generally belongs to the statuary's art : in other words, it is more picturesque than sculpturesque. The inscription on the base is from the pen of Burke. There is another monumental group to the same illustrious statesman, by the same artist, in AVestminster Abbey, but it is in every respect inferior to that in Guildhall. \u2014 [See Westminster Abbey. CHEAPSIDE, GREAT and LITTLE, Finsbury, are situated in that part of Long-alley, Moorfields, which leads from Crown-street towards Bloorfields. CHEAPSIDE, one of the principal streets and thoroughfares in the City, extends from the north-east corner of St. Paul's churchyard to the Old Jewry, Bucklersbury and the Poultry. It derives its name from the Saxon word Cheap, which signifies a market, the street therefore is the Mar- ket-side ; as in the year 1331, the south side only was built upon, and the north side was an open field, where jousts or tournaments were often held. One of these given by Edward III., lasted for three days together. This market was called West Cheap, while that beyond Cannon-street was called East Cheap.

This monument of national munificence and gratitude owes its origin to the benevolent exertions of Sir Stephen Fox, the ancestor of Lord Holland, who proposed to John Evelyn, as recorded in his diary (vol. 1, p. 535), on the 6th Sep tember, 1681, the purchasing of Chelsea College, which Charles II. had presented to the Royal Society, who were willing to dispose of it for such a purpose. On the spot where the present Hospital stands was anciently a college for secular priests, which in the reign of James I. was appropriated for the residence of a certain number of divines, in order to study the Popish controversy. This building, however, being given as before mentioned, to the Royal Society, was afterwards pulled down, and the present substantial and ap propriate structure erected in its stead. Sir Stephen not only persuaded the King (Charles II.) to settle \u00a35,000 a year, and erect a building of the value of \u00a320.000, but became an active friend and liberal benefactor to the establishment. The sale of the college and other arrangements were completed in the month of February 1682, and the building of the New Hospital forthwith commenced, from the designs, and under the superintendence of Sir Christopher AVren. It is a spacious building, and a very appropriate design, remarkable for the justness and harmonious proportions of its different parts, and like many of the build ings of Palladio, is composed of brick and stone, the quoins, cornices, pediments and columns, being of the latter material. It forms three sides of a quadrangle, towards the river, and the area formed between the wings ; the body of the building and the bank of the river is laid out in walks and grass plats, for a promenade. The centre of the building is embellished with a te trastyle portico of the Roman Doric order, surmounted by a handsome lofty turret, in which is a clock. In this parish is the Botanical Garden belonging to the Apothecaries' Company [see Apothecaries' Company]; and the village has been celebrated for some centuries as the residence of persons of distinction. The episcopal palace of the Bishops of Winchester was, till lately, situated in Cheyne-walk ; but it has been pulled down, and the town residence of the present and future bishops removed to a spacious mansion on the west side of St. James's-square. \u2014 [i'eeAViNCHESTER- House.

The great Sir Thomas More also occupied a splendid mansion in this parish, which stood at the north end of Beaufort-row, and, after being the residence of many illustrious charac ters, was pulled down in 1740 by Sir Hans Sloane. At the western extremity of the village is the elegant villa of Lord Cre morne, who has a good collection of pic tures of the Italian and Flemish schools ; and adjoining thereto is a house formerly the property and residence of Dr. Hoadley, author of the comedy of the \" Suspicious Husband.\" Ranelagh also stood in the parish ; but its glories are faded, and its once splendid walls are desolate and de serted.

Baker in his chronicles says it received the epithet \u2022' Danes\" from having been the burial place of Harold the Dane. AVilliam of Malmsbury mentions a great conquest over the Danes near this spot, where many were slain in a place since called Clement the Danes ; but Fleetwood, the antiquary, who was Recorder of London in the reign of Elizabeth, reported to the Lord Trea surer Burleigh, who resided in this parish, that when most of the Danes were driven out of this kingdom, those few that re mained were permitted to settle and to marry English wives, and had the district between Thomey Isle, now called AVest minster, and Caer Lud, Ludgate, assigned to them, where they built a church that was afterwards consecrated and called after them and the before-mentioned saint \u2014 Ecclesia dementis Danorum. on the right hand from Mill-street, near the Bridge 3. is in Little Turnstile, Holborn 4. is at No. 58, Bishopsgate street Within.

The old church was taken down in 1680, and the body of the present church was rebuilt to the old tower by Sir Christopher Wren, in 1682. By an inscription on a slab of white marble in the north aisle it appears that Sir Christopher gave his valu able services, when he stood alone in this country as an architect, to the parish, gra tuitously. Generosity and liberality are among the most prominent features of that great man's character. In the year 1719, when Wren was in his ninetieth year, when Steele published his beautiful and appropriate apologue of Nestor, concerning the ungrateful neglect of Wren ; Gibbs, no unworthy follower, added the present lofty, picturesque and handsome tower and steeple to this church. The church is a very handsome struc ture, built entirely of solid stone, lighted by two stories of windows, and has a commodious and well arranged interior, ninety-six feet in length, sixty-three in breadth and forty-eight in height. It is a Tectory, in the City of AVestminster, in the diocese of London and in the county and archdeaconry of Middlesex.

The date of its foundation is at present unknown, but AVilliam de Southlee appears to have been its rector prior to 1309, and before the suppression of religious houses, it was in the gift of the abbot and brethren of the convent of St. Peter, Westminster. Queen Mary, however, in the first year of her reign, gave the advowson of this church to the Bishop of London and his successors in that see for ever, with whom it still re- mains, as hereafter mentioned.

Shakspeare, however, if he could be relied on as a chronologist, makes it of much older date, for Justice Shallow, in the second part of Henry IV. speaks two or three times of his freaks, and of his acting in the shows, when he was a mem ber of this inn, and boasts, \" I was once of Clement's-inn, where, I think, they will talk of Mad Shallow yet.\" In the second year of Henry VII., Sir John Can telow demised this inn to John and Wil liam Elliott, in trust for the students ; and in 1538, it descended to Sir William Holies, then Lord Mayor, and from him to the Earl of Clare, in whose family it still remains. 1666, and the present erected by Sir Chris topher AVren in 1686. It is a neat, plain and appropriate but unpretending building, of theComposite order, with a square tower and a balustrade. The interior is well arranged and neatly pewed, is sixty-four feet in length, forty feet in breadth, and thirty-four in height. It is a rectory, and the living was considerably augmented by having the neighbouring parish of St. Mar tin Orgar united to it by an act of parlia ment, after the fire of London. The parish church of St. Martin Orgar stood on the east side of St. Martin's-lane, Cannon- street, and was so designated from its dedication to St. Martin, and from one Ordgarus, who is generally supposed to have been the founder. This church was also a rectory, the patronage of which was granted about the year 1181 by Ordgarus, with the consent of his wife and sons, to the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's, in whom, except as hereafter mentioned, it still remains. Since the union of this parish with that of St. Clements, the living is presented alternately by the Bishop of London and the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's.

COLLEGE OF SURGEONS, The ROY'AL, is situated on the south side of Lincoln's-inn-fields. The portico is hex- astyle, of the Ionic order, with a proper en- tablature and acroteria. In the frieze is inscribed \u2014 - The College of Physicians was established in 1523, by a charter from Henry VIII., which authorized its council to prevent any person from publicly practising as a phy sician, within seven miles of London, without previously becoming either a fel low or a licentiate of the college ; and other important privileges. The society's first building was a man sion in Great Knight-rider-street, Doctors' Commons, that was presented to them by Dr. Linacre, physician to Henry VIII. They afterwards removed to a house which they purchased in Amen-comer, Pater noster-row, where Dr. Harvey, the illus trious discoverer of the circulation of the COLI.EGICM - REGALE - CH1RCRGORUM. Upon the acroteria above the entabla ture are a row of antique bronze tripods, which are attributes of Apollo Medicus, the ancient tutelary god of surgery. Over the centre intercolumniation is a massive shield, on which is sculptured the armorial bearings of the College, supported by two classical figures of \u00c6sculapius, with his club and mystic serpent. In the interior, are a spacious and handsome museum, board and council-rooms, libraries, con versation-rooms a handsome hall and do mestic apartments. It was designed by the late George Dance, Esq., R.A., and is altogether one of the most classical and appropriate buildings in the metropolis. The surgeons were originally incorpo rated with the barbers by Edward IV. in 1461, by the name of the Company of Barbers, who were then the only prac titioners of surgery. But as others after wards practised this latter art who were blood, built a library and public hall, which he granted for ever to the college, and endowed it with his estate, which he resigned to them in his life-time. This building was destroyed by the great fire in 1666, after which, in 1674, the college purchased a piece of ground in Warwick lane, Newgate-street, and raised a con siderable sum for the erection of a new college. This building was designed by Sir Christopher AVren, and finished in 1689.

COLLIER'S-RENTS, Southicark, is the fifth turning on the left hand in AV'hite- street, near the back of St. George's church. In the 5th Charles I. the surgeons ob tained further privileges, but continued in an ill-assorted union with the barbers till 1745, when they separated themselves from the shavers, who however retained their ancient hall, built by Inigo Jones, and all their pictures and anatomical preparations. \u2014 [See Barbers'- Hall.] \u2014 On which occasion they procured an act of parliament, by which they were solely incorporated by the name of \" The Master, Governors and Commonalty of the Art and Science of Surgery of London.\" They therefore erected themselves a handsome hall on the site of the New Sessions' House in the Old Bailey, in which they continued till they built their present handsome structure before described, and procured their ci devant company to be elevated to the rank of a college, by royal charter in 1800. The present officers of the college are a council, of which Honoratus Leigh Thomas, Esq.,F.R.S.,isthe President; Sir William Blizard, Sir Astley Cooper, John Abernethy, Esq., and sixteen other eminent surgeons, Vice-Presidents ; seven Curators of the Museum ; Sir William Blizard and Sir Everard Home, Honorary Professors of Anatomy and Surgery ; George Guthrie and Herbert Mayo, Esqrs., Professors of Anatomy and Surgery ; Count Cuvier, Honorary Member ; E.

Why ! the huge blocks of Travertine mar. ble, of which the Colosseum was heaped on high by the imperial command of Vespa sian, would out-number the nine-inch bricks of its modern namesake. Of the Panorama within its walls, it is impossible to speak too highly ; its decep tion is so complete, and the accuracy of the architectural and other details so cor rect. Every church, house and other building may be known, and like the real view, will bear even the test of telescopic examination. It was painted, and the sketches finished by Mr. E. T. Parris and his assistants, and is of the enormous size of 46,000 square feet of surface. The view from the top of the cupola of the surrounding country is very fine, and the spectator is interested by an inspection of the original ball and cross of the Cathe dral. Under the Panorama is a circular saloon for the exhibition of works of art, and for refreshments. It contains many fine pieces of sculpture, and is ever varying as sales take place, and fresh subjects arrive. In the circular tube that goes up the centre of the building is an ascending room, by which persons who wish it, may enter at the bottom and in a few seconds find them selves at the top. There are also some beautiful conservatories, full of the finest varieties of exotics, and from the agreeable warmth produced by hot water, will be an attractive promenade in the winter season ; a splendid fountain, and a very beautiful Swiss cottage of several apartments, in which the architectural characteristics of the cha let are well preserved. From the win dows are seen real waterfalls, rocks, moun tain-scenery, and a lake, with beautiful foreign waterfowl. It is now the property of Mr. Hornor's trustees, and under most judicious management. A more detailed account of this structure is to be found in my work of London in the Nineteenth Century. COLONNADE - MEAVS, Brunswick - square, are the before named mews, from the Colonnade to Bernard-street. COLOSSEUM, The, Regent's-park, is a colossal building on the eastern side of the Regent's-park, between Park-square and Cambridge-terrace. It contains a pano- ramic view of London, and the surround- ing country, as far as the eye can see, taken by Mr. Hornor, a land surveyor, from a temporary observatory, that was raised above the cross of St. Paul's Cathe- dral, during the construction of the present new ball and cross by C. R. Cockerel], Esq., A.R.A. During the progress of the sketches, I was occasionally a witness to the precision with which the original projector of this immense picture, determined the situations of the various buildings on his paper, and of his extreme inaccuracy as to architec- tural details. At this period I was en- gaged with Mr. Hornor, as his architect, in making a series of designs for a building to contain his vast project, from a tempo- rary timber building of ninety feet diameter for the Green-park, through a variety of others, circular and polygonal of various diameters and of various orders ; till one of the Tuscan order, forthisvery spot, suggested by me, was approved by Mr. Nash, as architect to the crown, to whom I origi nally introduced Mr. Hornor. Necessity, however, or some more powerful influence, induced the artist (after a very compli mentary letter to me, with hopes of a long continuance of our friendship, and expres \u2022 sions of his satisfaction with my exertions,) to employ Mr. Decimus Burton to super intend the execution of the building, which, as far as external design consists, is pre cisely the same as one of mine, namely, a sixteen sided polygon, with a Doric portico and cupola. The grandest feature of this building is its portico, which is one of the finest and best proportioned of the Greco-Doric in the metropolis, and gives a majestic feature to this part of the park. The lodges are in equal good taste, and do great credit to their architect, Mr. Decimus Burton. The building is, however, wrongly named, for it is more like the Pantheon at Rome, than the mighty Colosseum, of which the ancient proverb ran \u2014 COLOUR-Ct., Southivark, turns off at No. 14, the first turning on the right hand from Queen-street.

The refectory was converted into the first glass-house ever established inEngland, which was burned down in 1575. On this site, now stands a magnificent tea warehouse, belonging to the East India Company ; it is a parallelogram of two hundred and fifty feet in length, by a hundred and sixty in depth, and encloses a court yard of a hundred and fifty feet long, by sixty broad, entered by a well proportioned archway.

CUMBERLAND-Terr., Regent's Park, is the last terrace on the right hand side of the park, going from the Colosseum, before coming to St. Katherine's Hospital, and is the next above Chester-terrace. It is one of the largest terraces in this park of terraces, and has greater pretensions to architectural beauty than any other in its neighbourhood. The prevailing character of Cumberland-terrace is grandeur, arising from a majestic simplicity of large parts. It consists of a lofty rusticated ground story, above which is an elevation of two stories, embellished with columns and pilas- ters of the Ionic order. Its situation, for a metropolis, is unrivalled, and the plan- tations are judiciously employed to set off the architectural and sculptural decorations of the buildings. It is from the designs of Mr. Nash, and may be reckoned among the best of his compositions. For a more detailed account of this and other terraces and villas in the Regent's Park, and other recent architectural improvements in the metropolis, I must again refer my readers to my work of London in the Nineteenth Century. CUMBERLAND-Ct 1. is in Tottenham- street, Tottenham-court-road, two doors from Norfolk-street, Middlesex Hospital. \u2014 2.

CUPER'S-GARDENS, are opposite the last, on the south bank of the Thames, and were in 1636 the gardens of Arundel-"], [176, "CUR 160 cus erected by Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper, in the reign of Elizabeth. The clerks, or cursitors, were anciently called Clerici Brevium de Cursu. They are a distinct corporation, twenty-four in number, each having certain counties and cities allotted them, for which they make out such original writs as are required, and execute their duties either personally or by deputy. The present officers are John Appleyard, Esq., Principal; John Pensam, and Thomas Jones, Esq. Assistants ; twenty Cursitors ; and William Bass, Bag-bearer. The hours of attendance are from 12 till 2, and from 6 till 8 in term, and from 1 1 till 2 in vacation. house in the Strand, the mansion of Tho mas Howard, Earl of Arundel. The premises were afterwards rented by a per son named Cuper, who had been the earl's gardener, and from him they obtained their name. In the early part of the last cen tury, they were much resorted to as a place of public entertainment, where music, fire works, &c, were exhibited. There were also several statues and other remains of Greek and Roman antiquities, part of the celebrated collection of the earl, which being mutilated and defaced, were not thought good enough to be presented to the University of Oxford, and placed among the Arundelian marbles. Part of these are said to have been removed by the Earl of Burlington to Chiswick. CURSITOR-St., Chancery-lane, is about the middle of the east side of Chancery- lane, and leads into Castle-street and Holborn. CUPID'S-Ct., Barbican, is about the middle of the west side of Golden-lane. CURE'S ALMS HOUSES, College-yard, Counter-street, Southwark, was founded in 1584, by Thomas Cure, Esq., for the reception of 16 poor men and women, with an allowance of twenty-pence a week each, and by the addition of benefactions of his son and Mrs. Appleby, each of them receives an additional allowance of sixteen shillings a year. CURTAIN -ROAD, Shoreditch, is the first turning on the right hand in Worship- street, going from Shoreditch, and reaching to Old-street-road. It received its name from the Curtain Theatre, wherein Ben Johnson, Tarlton and other celebrated actors of that period often performed.

CURRIERS'-HALL, London-wall, is in Curriers' -hall-court, four houses eastward of Wood-street, Cheapside, and is a conve- nient useful structure. The curriers' com- pany is of considerable antiquity, since, according to Stow, they founded a guild, or brotherhood, in 1367, in the conventual church of the AVhite Friars, in Fleet-street. King James I. incorporated the society by letters patent, dated the 30th April, 1605, by the name of \" The Master, Wardens and Commonalty of the Art or Mystery of the Curriers of the City of London.\" This company are trustees for several charities, and, among others, one called \" Dawes's Charity,\" which is distributed among ten poor freemen of the company, and a sum to bury certain of their pensioners. CURZON-St., May Fair, is the first turn- ing on the left in Clarges-street from Pic- cadilly. CUSHION-Ct., Old Broad-street, is the se- cond turning on the right hand from Threadneedle-street. CUSTOM HOUSE, Lower Thames-street, is about a quarter of a mile on the right hand from London-bridge, and is insulated, having its northern front next Thames- street, its southern front next the river, its western end next Billingsgate, and its eastern end towards Tower-hill. The earliest building known to have been erected on this spot, for business like that of the present, was in the reign of Elizabeth, but it was destroyed by the great fire of 1666. It was rebuilt on a more extensive scale in the reign of Charles II. by Sir Christopher AVren. This build ing was also destroyed by fire in 1718, and rebuilt upon almost a similar plan. It was again consumed by fire in February 1814, and rebuilt upon a yet larger and more extensive scale by David Laing, Esq., the architect to the Board of Customs. CURRIERS'-HALL-Ct., London-wall, is four houses on the eastward of the north end of AVood-street, Cheapside. CURRIERS'-ROW, Blackfriars, is the first turning parallel westward to St. Andrew's-hill.

It is four hundred and eighty-eight feet in length, and one hundred and seven - in depth. The building is all faced with - Portland stone, and the water front is em - bellished with columns of the Ionic order. The interior is commodious and well adapt- ed to the nature of the business that is sufficient consequence to maintain a dis. pute before parliament, with the Goldsmiths. They were afterwards incorporated by letters patent, granted by Henry V., in 1417, and subsequently united to the Haft Sheath Makers. They are styled in the patent, \" The Master, Wardens and Commonalty of the Mystery of Cutlers of London.\" They are trustees or guardians of several benevolent charities ; one a con siderable legacy of Thomas Bache, in 1556, and another of John Craythorne, in 1568, of the reversion of the Belle Sauvage, on Ludgate-hill, for various cha rities, exhibitions at the two universities, &c. That inn alone produces the company a rent of \u00a31,101. 10s. a year. A very de tailed account of these charities, and the mode in which they have been and are appropriated, are to be found in the Par liamentary Reports of the Endowed Cha rities of the City of London. carried on within its walls.

DRAPERS' ALMS HOUSES. The cha- rities entrusted to the care of the Drapers' Company are numerous and munificent, and their various alms houses or hospitals for the poor, are more, I believe, than most of the City companies. Among these is a very ancient esta- blishment founded and endowed in 1576, by AVilliam Lambarde, the author of the \" Perambulation of Kent,\" for twenty poor persons. It is situated on the south-west side of Greenwich, where the roads separate to Lewisham and London, and is called \" Queen Elizabeth's College.\" He com- mitted the guardianship of it to the Master of the Rolls, for the time being, and the Drapers' Company. This is said to be the first hospital ever founded by a protestant. The Drapers' Company are also the trustees for the management of Bancroft's alms houses [See Bancroft's Alms Houses], which are mentioned under their proper head ; and have an interest in other alms houses in Whitechapel-road, near the Turnpike, which were founded in 1698, by John Pernell, for four poor Drapers' widows, and four widows of the East India Company's Seamen, belonging to the parish of Stepney. They have also an alms house in Cross- street, Newington, Surrey, nearly opposite Newington church, founded by John Walter, in 1651, for sixteen poor men and women. The statutes of these latter, are printed at large in Aubrey's Antiquites of Surrey, vol. 5, p. 142 ; and also another, by the same founder, near Blackman- street, Southwark, for four poor men and eight women; and a third by the same founder, in 1658, in Old-street, for eight poor widows. The company are likewise invested with the trust of some alms houses This ward is divided into eight municipal precincts, and is governed by an alderman, George Scholey, Esq., a deputy, and seven other common-councilmen, and other ward officers. The charity school of this ward is united to those of Bridge and Candlewick wards, and was established by subscription in 1 7 1 0. Its property consists of a freehold school house, purchased about fifty years ago, with the excess of contributions above the expenditure, and is supported by subscrip tion, by a portion of Mr. Betton's legacy to to the Ironmongers' Company, and other benefactions. They educate and clothe sixty boys and forty girls, and the school is managed by a committee of inhabitants, of whom Thomas Saunders, Esq. is Trea surer. for twelve poor persons, at Bromley, in Middlesex, founded by John Edmondson, Esq., in 1706; and also, conjointly with the parish of Shoreditch, of others in the Kingsland-road, opposite Huntingdon street, about a quarter of a mile from Shoreditch church, founded in 1713, by Samuel Harman, for twelve poor men and women.

It is a spacious and commodious edifice, with a very hand- some modern elevation, of the Ionic order, elaborately embellished with foliage, de- signed by Adams, one of the Adelphi architects. The present hall and offices are built upon the ruins of a palace erected by Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex, in the reign of Henry VIII., on the site of several tenements belonging to the priory of St. Augustine, which he purchased at its suppression. This mansion being for- feited to the crown by his attainder and execution for high treason, it was purchased by the Drapers* Company, who converted it into a hall, which being destroyed by the fire of London, they erected the present hall, which comprises a spacious quadrangle, with buildings on every side, elevated upon a colonnade, with arches forming a piazza. The hall and court- room are embellished with portraits of Henry Fitz Alwyn, a member of the Com- pany, and the first lord mayor of London. The gardens are airy and well planted for the city, and are open, under certain regu- lations, to the public. The Drapers' Company was originally an ancient society or guild, devoted and dedicated to the Virgin Mary ; and was incorporated by letters patent of Henry Al. in 1439, by the title of\" The Master, AVardens, Brethren and Sisters of the Guild or Fraternity of the blessed Mary the Virgin, of the mystery of Drapers of the City of London.\" It is the third of the twelve chief livery companies of the City.

This splen- did Theatre Royal, is situated on the right hand of Bridges-street, Covent Garden, going up from Catherine-street, in the Strand, and extends along Little Russell-street into Drury-lane, which is at the back of the stage. The principal front next Bridges-street, is two hundred and thirty-one feet in length, and consists of a handsome elevation of the Ionic order. The interior is very splendid, and the theatrical entertainments are of the first order. The theatre was designed by Benjamin AVyatt, Esq,, but the present interior is from the design of Samuel Beazley, Esq. The first theatie upon this spot, was the Cock-pit, in Drury-lane, to which Sir AVilliam Davenant removed his company in 1658, where they performed till the resto- ration of Charles II., when he removed them to his new theatre in Lincoln's-inn- fields. The Cockpit was then engaged by a bookseller of the name of Rhodes, who had been wardrobe keeper to the Black friars' Theatre. Davenant and Killegrew afterwards obtained patents from the king for more regular performances, and the latter built a new theatre in Drury-lane. Killegrew's company were called \" the bestowed upon them by an illustrious Irish patriot to the editor of this work, that it was above all praise.

DUCHESS-St., Portland-place, is the first turning, right and left, going from Lang- ham-place, towards the Regent's-park. It extends from Duke-street eastward to Mansfield-street westward. In January 1672, Killegrew's theatre was burned down, and was rebuilt by Sir Christopher AVren. This admirable thea tre for seeing and hearing, was opened on the 26th of March 1674, and was the scene whereon flourished, in succession, Wilks, Cibber, Booth, Quin, Macklin, Mrs. Clive and Mrs. Pritchard. Within these walls also flourished that ornament of the British theatre, David Garrick, who on his dignified retirement from the stage, as signed his property to the late Richard Brinsley Sheridan and others. These gen tlemen pulled down Wren's theatre in 1791, and rebuilt it on too large a scale. It was designed by Holland, in so light and elegant, and airy a style, that it may be considered the very beau-ideal of a me tropolitan theatre. This theatre has also its grand reminiscences, for on its boards flourished the inimitable Siddons, and her able brothers, the Kembles. It was there that Bannister, Munden, Elliston, Dowton, Miss Farren, and their cotemporaries en tertained and instructed millions, and there it was that the greatest tragedian of do mestic life, Fanny Kelly, commenced her brilliant career. DUCHY OF CORNAVALL OFFICE, Somerset-place, is on the left hand side of the quadrangle from the Strand. In this office is conducted all the business of the King, as Duke of Cornwall.

The present theatre was built by subscription, in shares, and an excellent description of it may be found in a publication of its plans, &c, by the architect. I have also given much more detailed accounts of it, than there is room for in this work, in my London in the Nineteenth Century, wherein there is a well engraved view of its exte rior, from a drawing by T. H. Shepherd, Esq., who made the whole series of elabo rate architectural views for that work. DUCKING-POND-MEWS, May-fair, is on the south-side of Sheppard's-market.

The college experienced many vicissi tudes during the troublesome times of the two Cromwells. The Fortune theatre which he had left to them had been sup pressed, and the ground was advertised to let for building in the Mercurius Politicus of the 14th and 21st February, 1661. Upon the restoration of Charles II. the affairs of the college were suffered to revert to their original channel, and, with little material variation, have so continued ever since. DULWICH ALMSHOUSES, Lamb-alley, Bishopsgate - street. \u2014 [See Alleyn's Almshouses. DULWICH COLLEGE is situated near the hamlet of that name, four miles from the Stone's-end, Southwark, on the left hand side of the road from Camberwell- green to Beckenham. It was founded and endowed in 1619 by Edward Alleyne, who named it \" The College of God's Gift.\" The manor of Dulwich, which belongs to the college, was purchased by the founder in 1606, in the early part of the reign of James I., of Sir Francis Calton, to whose ancestor it had been granted by Henry VIII. on the suppression of monasteries, it being a portion of the estates of Bermondsey Abbey. Edward Alleyne, the founder, was an actor of great celebrity in Shakspeare's days, and was reckoned with Burbage, by Baker in his Chronicles, as \" two such actors as no age must ever look to see the like.\" Fuller, the historian, describes him as \" the Roscius of the age, especially in majestic parts.\" Alleyne was sole pro- prietor of the Fortune playhouse in AVhite- cross-street, which he built ; of the Bear Garden at Bankside, and other profitable places of public resort. Having acquired a considerable fortune, he determined to bestow it upon a charitable foundation ; but the Lord Chancellor Bacon did all that was in his power to prevail upon him to divert a portion of his endowment in found- ing two professorships at the Universities. Alleyne, however, obtained the royal assent, fixed upon a portion of his newly -purchased estate at Dulwich, to which he had retired from the stage, and resided at the manor- house, still called Hall-place, nearly ad- joining the college. He built, endowed and managed the institution himself from 1619 till his death in November 1626, in the sixtieth year of his age. He was buried in the same tomb with his wife and mother, under the chancel in the college chapel. On the day of its foundation there were present the Lord Chancellor Bacon, Lord Arundel, Sir John Howland, high sheriff of the county, Inigo Jones, the king's ar- chitect, and many other persons of distinc- The building consists of a centre and two wings, and was built by Inigo Jones. It contains a chapel and apartments for the master, and lodgings for the inmates. In the chapel is the elaborate copy of Raf faelle's transfiguration, painted by Giulio Romano, the favourite scholar of that illus trious painter, that was presented in 1796 to the college by Thomas Mills, Esq., of Great Swaff ham, in Suffolk. The various apartments, the history and nature, the rules, constitution, &c. of this excellent charity are described at great length, and with singular interest, in Mr. Highmore's Pietas Londinensis, who passed many of his youthful and more mature days in its peaceful vicinity. The founder of this college also erected and founded, about the year 1614, ten almshouses at the west end of Bishopsgate parish, in a place then called Petty France, but now pulled down and converted into New Broad-street, for ten poor men and women. \u2014 [See Alleyne's Alms houses.] \u2014 He also built and endowed another in Pest-house-lane, Old-street, in 1616, for ten poor men and women ; and others in Deadman's-place, Southwark, in the same year, for the same number of poor persons. The master of Dulwich College is head of the manor of Dulwich, and must be, as well as the warden, unmarried, and of the same name as the founder; and as the warden by the statutes always succeeds the master on a vacancy, great interest is al ways made by unmarried men of that name to succeed to so comfortable an office\". Since the death of the founder many ad ditional bequests have been made to this college, but none since its foundation have equalled the fine collection of pictures left by the late Sir Francis Bourgeois, R.A., by whose will, dated the 20th December, 1810, he devised his \" whole collection of"], [189, "DUL 173 DUN pictures, frames and prints, together with all the furniture, ornaments, plate, china, clocks and other effects, in his three lease hold houses in Charlotte-street and Port land-road, to the Master, Warden and Fellows of Duhvich College, and their suc cessors for ever, to be kept and preserved therefor the inspection of the public, upon such terms and at such times as they should think proper.\" To these he added \u00a310,000, the interest of which was to pay the annual expense of keeper, attendants, &c. ; and \u00a32,000 for repairing the west wing or old picture gallery for the reception of the pictures. He also left the college resi duary legatee, to be used for the general repairs of the college. The west wing being incapable of repair, the members of the college contributed \u00a36,000, and Mr. Des Enfans, to whom Sir Francis had left the life interest of all his property, also gave \u00a36,000 more. These sums, with the \u00a32,000 legacy, were therefore appropriated to the building of the present picture galleries, mausoleum of the founder, Noel Des Enfans, Esq., and Mr. Des Enfans, and other offices, from the designs and under the superintendance of John Soane, Esq., the professor of ar chitecture in the Royal Academy. The gallery is 144 feet in length, 20 in breadth, and 20 in height, divided by lofty arches into five compartments. The entire building,, and a descriptive and critical ca talogue of all the pictures, is printed in one of the early volumes of the Annals of the Fine Arts, which being a periodical, it might be well to reprint in the form of a pamphlet, as most of the other catalogues are mere titles of the pictures. The building was begun in 1811, and finished in 1813, and the gallery was opened for public inspection in 1817- The hours of admission from April to Novem ber are from ten till five, and the rest of the year from eleven to three every day, except Fridays and Sundays.

There was a church here so long ago as the time of the Saxons, when it was called the church of All Saints, and we read of the Manor of Stiben-heath, under the reign of William the Norman ; when the church changed its name does not appear. It is a large struc ture, consisting of a chancel, a nave, and two aisles. At the west end is a plain tower, containing a peal of twelve bells. To this church formerly belonged a rectory and a vicarage, the former was a sinecure, and in the gift of the Bishop of London, and the latter in the gift of the rector, till Ridley, Bishop of London gave the manor of Stepney, and the advowson of the church to Edward VI., who granted them to Sir Thomas Wentworth, the Lord Chamberlain of his Household. The advowson was afterwards purchased by the principal and scholars of King's-hali and Brasenose College, Oxford ; they presented two persons to the rectory and vicarage, by the name of the portionists of Ratcliffe and Spitalfields, till the year 1741, when the hamlet of Bethnal-green, being sepa rated and made a new parish by act of parliament, Stepney became possessed by only one rector. As this is at present a rectory impropriate, the above - named principal and scholars, receive the great tithes, together with Easter Offerings and surplice fees. It is a rectory, in the County of Mid. dlesex, in the diocese of London, is exempt from any archdeaconry, and the present rector is the Rev. Thomas Barneley, who was instituted by the principal and fellows of Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1815. There is also another church in this parish, called Stepney New Church, that was built partly by subscription, partly at the expense of the patrons of the living, and partly at the expense of his Majesty's Commissioners for building new churches. It is situated at the rear of the London Hospital, near Mile-end, and is in the later pointed style of architecture, with large transverse windows at the east and west ends, and octagonal turrets and pinacles at each angle. The pulpit, galleries, altar piece, roof and pewings, are of carved and moulded oak panelling. It is from the design of the late John W alters, Esq., and was erected in 1819. tion may be seen in my life of Sir Chris topher Wren, engraved by Wilson Lowry, after a geometrical drawing by Joseph Gwilt, Esq., F.S.A., for which he received the silver medal of the Royal Academy. It is not too much to say of this spire, that it stands unrivalled for elegance, beauty, and science. When Wren designed it, he had, no doubt, the steeples of the high church, Edinburgh, and of St. Nicholas, at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in his mind's eye, but he has surpassed both in every essential quality of such a work. The body of the church, having been only repaired by Sir Christopher Wren, having fallen much into decay, it was taken down and rebuilt in 1821, under the directions of Mr. David Laing, the archi tect of the Custom-house. The patronage of this living was an ciently in the prior and canons of Canter bury, who in 1365 granted it to Simon Islip, their archbishop, and his successors, in whom it still remains. It is a rectory, and one of the thirteen peculiars of the Archiepiscopal see of Canterbury. The present rector is the Rev. R. Hesketh, who was instituted by the archbishop in 1817- The parish have many excellent charities under their care, which are espe cially enumerated in the Reports of the Parliamentary Commissioners of the En dowed Charities of the City of London.

Stepney is a very ancient village, and was formerly a considerable distance from Lon- don. Stow mentions, that in 1299 a parliament was held at the house of Henry Wallies, Mayor of London, who resided in this village, and here Edward I. con- firmed the great charter of liberty. It was originally one of the largest parishes in England, and contained within its boun- daries, what are now the parishes of St. Mary -le-bone, at Stratford, St. Mary, Whitechapel, St. Anne, Limehouse, St. John, AVapping, St. Paid, Shadwell, St. George, Ratcliffe-highway, Christ Church, Spitalfields, and St. Matthew, Bethnal- green. All these parishes have been sepa- rated from it, yet it still remains one of the largest within the Bills of Mortality, as it still contains the hamlets of Mile-end Old and New, Ratcliffe and Poplar.

But as it is about to be taken down, to the infinite regret of the city pickpockets, any de- scription of it is unnecessary. It, how- ever, unfortunately for the public, narrowly escaped destruction by the great fire of 1666, the flames having been stopped within three houses of its walls. It has been several times repaired, but it will, ere long, perhaps while these lines are being printed, be removed. It is a church of very ancient founda- tion, in the gift of the abbot and convent of Westminster, who in 1237 gave it to Henry III. towards the maintenance of the foundation of the house called the leads by the east end and south side of St. Dunstan's church, into Lower Thames street.

It was afterwards conveyed to the abbot and convent of Alnwick, in Northumber land, in whom it continued till the disso lution of the religious houses by Henry VIII. Edward VI. granted the advowson of this church under the name of a vicarage to Lord Dudley. Soon after this, the rectory and vicarage were granted to Sir Richard Sackville, and the impropriation has ever since remained in private hands. The present vicar, is the Rev. Richard Lloyd, who was instituted by the Rev. C. Simeon, and the Society for Purchasing Livings, in 1805. There is a considerable number of bene factions for the poor of this parish, given to be distributed in money, bread, and coals, which are fully described in the Report of the Parliamentary Commis sioners on the Endowed Charities of the City of London. Among them is a house, No. 172, in Fleet-street, let at \u00a370 a year for the repairs of the church, and a Free Grammar School, founded by letters patent of the 4th of Queen Elizabeth, to be called \" The Free Grammar School of Queen Elizabeth,\" which does not appear from the Parliamentary Reports ever to have been endowed.

In 1640, it was purchased of the see by the Earl of Pembroke, who pulled it down and converted it into a range of buildings and wharfs, which were known by the general name of Durham-yard, the greater part of which is now covered by the buildings and streets called the Adelphi. \u2014 [See Adelphi Wharfs.

This parish was anciently a village of the same name, and its church is supposed to owe its origin to the chapel which belonged to the hospital founded about 1117, by Queen Matilda, consort of Henry I., for the reception of a certain number of leprous persons belong ing to the city of London and the county of Middlesex. In 1354, Edward III. granted this hospital to the master and brethren of the order of Burton, St. Lazar, of Jerusalem, in Leicestershire, for certain considerations, for which it became a cell to that order, till the general dissolution of religious houses by Henry VIII., who, in 1545, granted it to Lord Dudley. Soon after this period the chapel or church was made parochial, and on the 20th of April 1547, AVilliam Rawlinson was instituted Rector. rives its name from having been dedicated to a saint of that name, who was a native of Athens and flourished about the year 700 of the Christian \u00e6ra, who was abbot of Nismes, in France, and its addition from its situation. \u2014 [See Cripplegate. This church was built and founded about the year 1090, by Alfune, the first master of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and was destroyed by fire in 1545. The pre sent structure was then erected, which is one of the few churches in the city that escaped the great fire of 1666. It is of the pointed or English style of architec ture, is 174 feet in length, 63 in breadth, and 32 in height. The site of this parish was anciently a fen or moor, and its houses and gardens were accounted a village without the wall of London called Mora, whence the dis trict called the Moor and Moorfields. This village increased greatly, and was consti tuted a prebend of St. Paul's cathedral, which it still continues, under its ancient name, and the prebendary of Mora, or Mora without the Wall of London, hath the ninth stall on the south side of the choir in St. Paul's cathedral. Nigellus Medicus is said to have been the first pre bendary. The ancient church being very small, and much dilapidated, was taken down in 1623, and a church of brick was erected in its stead. This also became in its turn too small and inconvenient, when the in habitants applied for an act of parliament to enable them to rebuild it ; accordingly the old fabric was taken down in 1730, and the present very handsome edifice, designed by 4J*febs, was erected and completed in 1733. This substantial church is built of Portland stone, its interior is seventy-five feet in length, exclusive of the recess for the altar, and sixty feet in width, and is divided into nave and aisles, by Portland stone columns of the Ionic order, which assist the main walls in carrying the roof. The tower and spire are also of Portland stone, and are 160 feet high to the vane. A new entrance gateway, of great beauty, has been within these twenty years erected, from the designs of AVilliam Le verton, lisq., in which is introduced an ancient piece of sculpture, of more curio sity than beauty, representing the Last Judgment. The church is a rectory, in the county and archdeaconry of Middlesex, in the diocese of London, and in the patronage of the Lord Chancellor. The present rector is the Rev. J. E. Tyler, who was instituted in 1826. Part of the ancient City AA'all is still remaining on the south and east sides of the church- yard, particularly one of the bastions, which is close against the back part of Barber's Hall, in Monkwell-street. In this church are deposited the mortal remains of many eminent authors ; among which are, Speed, the historian and topo grapher ; Fox, the author of the Book of Martyrs ; Glover, the antiquary ; and, above all, Milton, the author of Paradise Lost. The patronage of this church was ori ginally in private hands, till it descended to Alemund, who granted it, after the deaths of himself and of Hugh, his only son, to the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's, in whom it still continues. The church is a vicarage, in the city and archdeaconry of London, and the present vicar is the Rev. William Holmes, Sub-Dean of the Chapel Royal, and Priest in Ordinary to the King, a Minor Canon of St. Paul's, and Rector of A vcley, in Essex, who was instituted in 1802.

This building is situated upon a spot of ground purchased by the Grocers' Com pany in 1411, of Robert, Lord Fitzwalter. The former hall was so capacious, that it served for some years for the uses of the Bank of England, which was kept here till the edifice in Threadneedle - street was men ; also another Free School at Colwall, in Herefordshire, founded by Humphry Walwyn, Esq., in 1612, which the com pany rebuilt and enlarged, so as to accom modate 52 free boys, in 1795 ; another at AVitney, in Oxfordshire, founded by Henry Box, Esq., in 1664 ; many gists for loans on security to poor members of the company to set them up in business amounting to \u00a34720 ; Lady Slaney's fund for the purchase of impropriations ; gifts for the relief and release of poor debtors, and numerous other splendid benefactions. Among other deeds for which the mem bers of this company are celebrated, is the Thomas Knolles, Lord Mayor of the City in 1411, who also bequeathed property in Budge-row, for the relief of the poor of the company, and began to build the present Guildhall of the City, in lieu of an incon venient and petty plan in Aldermanbury. Deputations of the company visit their Irish and other estates, their several schools and other charities, at suitable times ; which have the effect of producing the most beneficial effects upon the due ad ministration of these beneficent charities. For very interesting details of these funds, myreaders are referred to the Parliamentary Reports upon the Endowed Charities\" of the City of London. erected for that purpose. The Grocers' Company is the second of the twelve chief companies of the city, and was anciently called Pepperers ; but the trade having changed their name to that of Grocers, they were incorporated by letters patent of Edward III. in 1345, by the name of \" The Wardens and Com- monalty of the Mystery of the Grocery of the City of London,\" which was confirmed by Henry VI. in 1429, and by Charles I. in 1640, with additional powers. This company formerly held the highest rank among the twelve companies, and had in the reign of Henry IV. no fewer than twelve aldermen belonging to it at one time, and has had the names of five kings enrolled among its members. It has also very large estates, derived from different benefactors, and charged with various charitable uses, and many noble charities to which they are trustees. Those in Ireland (which I have professionally visited, as well as those of some of the other city companies) consist of the manor of Grocer's, at Muff, near Londonderry, where they have built a convenient house for their agent, David Babbington, Esq., called Grocer's Hall ; and share, with the other eleven chief companies of London, in certain lands and tenements purchased in the name of the Vintners' Company, and their proportion of the royal fishery of the kingdom of Ireland, held by the City of London. Their property and charities in London and other parts of England are also very extensive.

GUILDHALL, The, OF THE CITY' OF LONDON, is situated at the north end of King-street, Cheapside, and is the place where the principal business apper- taining to the corporation of London is transacted. It was began to be erected, according to the authority of Fabian, in 1411, the 12th of Henry IA'., by Thomas Knolles, citizen and grocer, then mayor, and his brethren the aldermen ; and instead of what Stowe calls, from his own remembrance, \" an olde little cottage in Alderman-berie-street, they made a faire and goodlie house, more neare unto St. Laurence church in the Jurie.\" GRUB'S-Y'ARD, Southwark, is a few doors on the right hand in Castle-lane, going from Maid-lane.

Ravenshaw, Esq., Deputy Chairman ; eighteen other Direc- tors ; and George Keys, Esq., Secretary. In the first year of Henry VI., 1422, John Coventry and John Carpenter, ex ecutors of the celebrated Richard AVhit tington, gave towards the paving of the great hall twenty pounds, which was a large sum in those days, and fifteen pounds more in the year following, to complete the said pavement with hard stone of Purbeck. They also glazed some of the windows of the hall, and of the mayor's court, on each of which were painted the arms of Whit tington. GUARDIAN SOCIETY' AND ASY'- LUM FOR THE PRESERVATION OF PUBLIC MORALS, New-road, St. George's in the East, was instituted in 1816, principally for the purpose of check- ing the progress of female depravity, by providing temporary asylums, employment and relief, to such depraved females as are removed from the public streets by the magistrates. The Asylum was first opened at Stepney, then in Church-lane, AVhite- chapel, and finally removed to its present situation. It has received great encourage- ment from the Corporation of London, and met with concomitant success. The inter- nal arrangement is under the direction of a committee of ladies, who deserve great praise for their strenuous and successful ex- ertions. The foundation of the mayor's court, which, till lately, was used as the Court of King's Bench, and is now restored to its former use, was laid in the reign of Henry VI., and that of the porch on the south side of the said court, in 1426. At the same time was built the mayor's chamber and old council chamber, now used as a com mittee-room, with the other rooms up stairs, now appropriated to the use of the Commissioners of Sewers ; the new coun cil-chamber, now used by the court of aldermen, with a room over the same for a treasury, wherein to preserve the books and records belonging to the city ; and another room underneath the said chamber was began to be built in 1614, and was completely finished shortly after Michael mas, 1615. Last of all, says Stowe, a stately porch, entering the great hall was erected to the south front, and the kitchen and other offices adjoining were built about The concerns of this society are con ducted by the general and three sub-com mittees, chosen from the subscribers ; and a very copious account of its rise, progress and views, is in Mr. Highmore's Philan tropia Metropolitana.

At the great fire of 1666, the whole of the interior and outer offices were destroyed ;"], [240, "GUI 224 GUI hall, which is 153 feet in length, 48 feet in breadth, and about 53 feet in height. At each end is a magnificent window of the pointed style, filled with painted glass, of the armorial bearings of the United King doms, of the City, and representations bf stars of the Orders of the Garter, Bath, St. Andrew and St. Patrick. These windows are modern restorations, and are in good style, but are sadly in want of their ancient accompaniments, the ancient oak roof of similar shape and ornament, instead of the conventicle round-headed windows which on either side between them look like two gorgeous eastern emperors presiding in a synod of Genevese puritans. The capitals of the pillars, that formerly supported the open-worked oak roof, are now made supporters of fourteen shields, containing armorial bearings of the United Kingdoms, of the City of London, and of the twelve principal companies in their ro tation of precedence. At the eastern end of the hall is a raised part separate from the rest, called the hustings, which is used for the several courts of hustings, for the assembling of the lord-mayor, aldermen, sheriffs and city officers on common halls, elections and other days of public busi ness. but the walls were of such remarkable solidity, that they survived all the fury of the raging element. A contemporary writer, Thomas Vincent, author of a pamphlet, called \" God's Terrible Voice in the City,\" published in 1667, says, \" Among other things that night, the sight of Guildhall was a fearful spectacle, which stood the whole body of it together in view for several hours, after the fire had taken it, without flames (I suppose, because the timber was of such solid oak), in a bright shining coal, as if it had been a palace of gold, or a great building of burnished brass.\" The temporary renovation of the interior was completed with the present tasteless attic and panelled ceiling within three years after the fire ; and grand as is the patched up ruins of this splendid hall, how much more grand must it have been, when each set of the clustered pillars which are against the walls, carried the noble oak pointed roof, that lay mouldering in the merciless flames of 1666. The corporation would do well to restore it, as well as other portions of this costly and usefiil monu ment of the liberality of our forefathers. Over the ancient front of the present southern porch, was a splendid frontis piece, decorated with the ancient arms of England, and beneath them an inscription with the following words in gilt letters \u2014 In this hall are several sculptural monu ments to great public characters, and in the various courts portraits and other pic tures. \" Reparata et ornata Thoma Rawlinson, Milit. Majore, An. Dom. mdccvi,\" Among the monuments in The Great Hall are a monument to William Pitt, Earl of Chatham, sculptured by the elder Bacon, erected in 1782 at the expense of the corporation, with an inscription written by Edmund Burke ; another to William Pitt, his son, sculptured by J. G. Bubb, and an inscription by the late George Can ning; one to Admiral Lord Nelson, sculp tured by James Smith, and an inscription from the pen of Richard Brinsley Sheridan ; a statue between two figures, one repre senting the City of London, and the other Commerce in a drooping state, William Beckford, lord-mayor in 1762 and 1769, with an inscription of that patriotic citi zen's celebrated reply to George III. on the 23d of May, 1770 : the scidpture is by Moore. The rest of the south front, it appears, from drawings and engravings of it extant, was in a style of considerable richness and grandeur. Some traces of this original style are still perceptible in the present porch, which is almost the only part now left in its original state. This ancient front was taken down and rebuilt in its present heterogeneous style, from the designs of the late George Dance, Esq., in 1 789. This attempt at the ancient beautiful style of our native country is the greatest, and perhaps the only failure in composition of that able and tasteful architect ; who, however, has his illustrious predecessor Sir Christopher Wren, to keep him company as his com peer in ignorance of the beauties of that splendid style. Guildhall is still entered by its ancient southern porch, at the extremity of which are a flight of step3 which lead through the centre bay into the great or common At the western end of the hall are the long celebrated giants Gog and Magog, the terror of youthful apprentices of former days, who firmly believed the legend \u2014 \" that when they heard the clock strike one, they came down to dinner.\" These"], [241, "GUI 225 GUI \u2022celebrated colossal figures, which are about 15 feet in height, are placed in each angle of this end, upon octagonal pedestals. They have black and bushy beards. One is armed with a sort of halbert, or battle- axe, and the other with a long staff, from which a ball set round with spikes is de- pendent by a chain. They are painted in imitation of nature, and present altogether a most formidable appearance. The author of a curious little work, called \" The gigantic History of the two famous Giants in Guildhall,\" London, 1741, says, that, according to the best authorities, one of them represents Corin\u00e6us, a giant of Trojan descent, who came over with Brutus, the great-grandson of \u00c6neas, the first conqueror of Britain, and the other Gog \u25a0 magog, the last of the British giants, whose history is pathetically recorded in the first volume of the Percy Histories. Strype supposes them to represent an an- cient Briton and Saxon ; but a very full and elaborate account of them is to be found in Hone's \" Ancient Mysteries,\" 8vo., p. 262, which contains references to many ancient authors by whom they are mentioned.

However long such figures may have been in Guildhall, the present statues are not of great antiquity, for they were put up about the year 1708 in the place of the two old wicker-work giants, which had formerly been accustomed to be carried in processions, and which it is generally be- lieved were first used at the restoration of Charles II., when they graced a triumphal arch erected on that occasion at the end of King-street. The maker of them was Richard Saunders, an eminent carver in those days, who resided in King- street, Cheapside. In the Council Chamber, a very tasteful room erected by the late George Dance, Esq., R.A., for the meetings of the court of common council, is a statue of King George III., in a marble niche, executed by F. L. Chantrey, Esq., at an expense to the corporation of \u00a33,089. 9s. bd. On the pedestal is an inscription written by Mr. Alderman Birch, who in the year of its erection, 1815, was Lord Mayor. In the south-west angle of the chamber is a bust of the Duke of Wel lington, by Turnerelli ; on the north-west a corresponding one of Granville Sharpe, by Chantrey ; and in the north-east another of Admiral Lord Nelson, by the Hon. Mrs. Darner, and presented by her to the corporation. In the Court of Aldermen, over the Lord Mayor's seat, are the king's arms, and over the door those of the city, finely carved. Round the border of the ceiling, which is embossed in fine style, are painted the arms of the lord mayors since 1780, which are continued in painted glass, in the windows. In an oval in the middle of the ceiling, is a painting by Sir James Thornhill, re presenting the City of London, with a mural crown upon her head, and a shield emblazoned with the City arms upon her left arm, attended by Minerva and two boys, one supporting the City sword, and the other pointing to the cap of mainte nance and the mace. Peace is presenting her with an olive-branch, and Plenty with her horn is pouring out riches.

It is used as a court-house and other munici- pal purposes for the City of Westminster. It was built about 1805, from designs of the late Samuel Pepys Cockerel1, Esq., and is of an octagonal form, with a portico to its entrance front of the Doric order. In the Chamberlain's Office is a picfure of the battle fought near Touton, in Yorkshire, between the rival families of York and Lancaster, on the 29th of March 1461, painted by Alderman Josiah Boy-, dell. Over the chimney-piece is a finely coloured print of the painted window at New College, Oxford, painted by Jen-is, from pictures by Sir Joshua Reynolds. There are also prints of Hogarth's Idle and Industrious Apprentices, and some spe cimens of ornamental writing. In the Chamberlain's parlour are depo sited duplicate copies of the honorary free doms and thanks which have been voted to distinguished personages by the City.

On the 7th of October, 1668, he was admitted by servitude a freeman of the Stationers' Company, and in 1673 was sworn of their livery. He began business as a bookseller with a stock of the value of about \u00a3200., in the house which still forms the angle between Lombard-street and Cornhill, and finding that the English bibles of that day were very badly printed, he engaged in a scheme of having them printed in Holland, and importing them. This being stopped by the University of Oxford, he contracted with them, and carried on a very extensive and lucrative trade in bibles for many years. Being a single man, and so penu rious as to dine on his shop counter, with no other table-cloth than an old newspaper, his expenses were consequently very trifling. The bulk of his splendid fortune was ob tained by purchasing seamen's tickets for their pay during the continental wars in the reign of Queen Anne, and by dealing in South Sea stock in 1720.

The dedication of this' immense fortune to charitable purposes arose from the in discreet officiousness of his maid-servant, whom he had agreed to marry. Previous to the appointed day, the old miser had ordered the foot pavement in front of his door to be mended as far as a particular stone which he had marked, and then left his home on business. The girl in his ab sence seeing a broken stone beyond this mark, desired the workmen to repair it, but they told her that Mr. Guy had told them not to go so far. She however directed it to be done, and said, more with the con fidence of a wife than with the duty of a servant, \" tell him I desired you, and he will not be angry.\" The result proved that she had presumed too far, for Guy on his return was so enraged to find his orders countermanded, that he renounced his ma trimonial projects, and took to the building and endowing of hospitals. In 1707, he built and furnished three wards on the north side of the outer court of St. Thomas's Hospital, and gave \u00a3100. a-year to it for eleven years previous to the erection of his own. He erected alms houses for fourteen poor persons, with a library and other liheral benefactions at Tamworth, in Staffordshire, where his mother was bom, and for which place he sat as member in several parliaments.

GUY'S HOSPITAL, Southwark, is situ- ated on the south side of St. Thomas's- street, and was founded by Thomas Guy, the son of a lighterman and coal-dealer of the same name, at Horselydown, where he was born in 1644. His father died when he was only in the eighth year of his age, Q2"], [244, "228 GUY GUY determined to build and endow an hospital for the cure of sick and impotent persons, for which purpose he took of the president and governors of St. Thomas's Hospital, a lease of a piece of ground opposite the south side of their hospital for the term of 999 years, at a ground rent of \u00a330. a-year. This spot was shortly after cleared ; the foundation of the intended hospital was laid in the spring of 1722, and the builders proceeded with such rapidity, that it was roofed in before the death of the founder, which happened on the 27th of December, 1724, in the eighty-first year of his age. The expense of erecting and finishing this hospital, amounted to the sum of \u00a318,792. His., and the sum left to endow it was \u00a3219,499. 0*. id. Some time before his death he removed the frontispiece of St. Thomas's hospital, which stood over the gateway, and erected it in its present situation ; when having en larged the gateway, he rebuilt the two large houses on each side, and erected the costly iron gates between them, at an ex pense of full \u00a33,000. The founder, by his will, dated the 4th of the September preceding his death, de vised the residue of his estate, which his executors valued at above \u00a3200,000, to certain persons whom he appointed execu tors, till an act of incorporation was ob tained, with powers to finish and furnish the structure began by him for his intended hospital, for the reception and relief of upwards of four hundred sick and diseased poor people, besides twenty lunatics to be maintained in a separate hospital. The whole expense of erecting and fur nishing this hospital, amounted to the sum of \u00a318,792. 16s., a great part of which this munificent benefactor of the human Tace expended in his lifetime, and he left \u00a3219,499. to endow it, both together amounting to \u00a3238,291. 16s., the largest sum that has ever been left by an indivi dual to charitable purposes. This hospital consistsof two quadrangles, besides the two wings which extend from the front to the street. The entrance is by a spacious iron gateway, supported by stone piers, which open into a square, in \u2022lhe centre of which is a bronze statue of its princely founder, clothed in his livery gown. The statue is well executed by Scheemakers, and in front of the pedestal upon which it is erected, is the following inscription : \u2014 He also bequeathed a perpetual annuity of \u00a3400. to Christ's Hospital, and liberal annuities to his poor relations for life ; besides a legacy of \u00a375,589. to be divided among his younger relations and executors, and \u00a31,000. for discharging poor prisoners for debt, within the city and counties of Middlesex and Surrey, who could be re leased for \u00a35. ; by which legacy and the good management of his executors, above six hundred poor prisoners were set at liberty. In addition to these bequests, he also left a perpetual legacy of \u00a3125. for the further support of his fourteen alms houses at Tamworth, and for putting out apprentices. The executors accordingly applied to par liament, who by an act of the 11th Geo. I. c. 12, passed, in 1724, granted them the powers of a corporation by the name of \" The President and Governors of the Hospital founded at the sole cost and charges of Thomas Guy, Esq.\" This hospital is joined with the royal hospitals, the Foundling, the colleges of Eton, YVinchester and Westminster, in the clause of exemption from the tax on servants. In the chapel is another statue of the founder, by the elder Bacon, upon the pedestal of which are emblematical me dallions and an inscription. This hospital has twelve spacious wards, containing upwards of 400 beds for as many in-patients, besides which, the charity re lieves upwards of 2,009 out-patients every year.

These members are three kings at arms, six heralds, four pursuivants and two heralds extraordinary, and their meetings are termed chapters. The kings are Garter, Clarencieux and Norroy ; and though their offices and titles are of great antiquity, little mention is made of them before the time of Edward III., when heraldry was in high esteem, and the king added many titles and offices, and instituted the nohle order of the Garter. Henry Y. instituted the office of Garter King at Arms ; and at a chapter of the kings and heralds held during the siege of Rouen, in Normandy, on the 5th of January, 1420, they formed themselves into a regular society, with a common seal, and appointed Garter their chief.

HOUSE OF LORDS, The, is situated also in Old Palace-yard, on the south side of the House of Commons, and of YVestminster Hall. It was removed at the time of the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, from a smaller room, to the pre- sent spacious and commodious apartment, which was formerly the Court of Requests, and the tapestry and furniture of the former House of Peers was removed hither. The fittings-up of the present house is nearly similar to that of the old one. The designs for the fine old tapestry with which it is hung were drawn by Cornelius Vroom, and the tapestry was executed by Francis Spiering. It represents the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588, and was bespoke by the Earl of Nottingham, Lord High Admiral, and commander-in-chief in that engagement. The Earl sold it to James I. ; but it was not put up till 1650, two years after the extinction of monarchy, when the House of Lords was used as a com- mittee room by the Commons. This tapestry was removed to the present room in 1820, and the entire apartment newiy fitted up. A new throne of very elegant design was then erected ; and, since that, another of still greater splendour was put up at the accession of George IV. The seats of the Lord Chancellor, who is Speaker of the House of Lords, of the judges and officers, are woolsacks covered with crimson woollen cloth. The seats of HOUNDSDITCH, is a considerable street or thoroughfare, which extends from oppo- site the church in Bishopsgate - street Without, to Aldgate church, along side of the ancient City wall. It derives its name from being on the site of the ancient City moat, which was so called from the num- ber of dead dogs thrown into it. HOUSE OF COMMONS, Old Palace- yard, Westminster. The building in which this great council of the nation hold their assemblies, was formerly a chapel founded by king Stephen, and dedicated to St. Stephen, the proto-martyr. In 1347 it was rebuilt in a magnificent manner by Edward III., who converted it into a col- \u25a0 legiate church ; but on its suppression, in the reign of Edward VI., it was adapted for the assembly of the representatives of the people of England, called the Com- mons House of Parliament, and for which purpose it has been ever since appropriated. It is a spacious chamber, large enough to contain the 658 members, and has about it various committee-rooms, a library, offices and other requisite apartments. The speaker's ancient chair is near the eastern end of the room, and is decorated with carved Corinthian columns, and a pediment behind, on the top of which are the king's arms. On the table in front, the speaker's mace is placed when the house is sitting, and around it are seated the clerks and other officers. The seats rise progressively from the floor to the wall; that upon the floor at the speaker's right hand, is called the Treasury Bench, and is usually occupied by the principal members of his Majesty's Minis try, and the opposite seat is generally occupied by the leading members of the opposition. The four representatives of the City of London, are the only members the peers are covered with cloth of a similar colour. Strangers may inspect the interior of the house for the fee of one shilling, and the new royal staircase for sixpence, and may attend generally below the bar while the House is sitting.

St. JAMES, Clerkenwell, the church of, is situated on the north side of Clerkenwell- green. (For the derivation of its name, see Clerkenwell.) On the spot where this church stands was anciently a priory, founded by Jordan Briset, a wealthy baron, who, about the year 1100, gave to his chaplain fourteen acres of land in a field adjoining to Clerks' or Clerken (the ancient plural of clerks) YVell, whereon he built a monastery for a certain number of Bene- dictine nuns. The church served the nuns and the neighbouring inhabitants as a place of worship, and was made parochial on the dissolution of the convent by Henry VIII. in 1539, and dedicated to St. James the Less, having been previously to the Virgin Mary, as appears from ancient re- cords, which call it \" Ecclesia Beat\u0153 Mari\u0153 defonte Clericorum.\" In 1623 the steeple of the old church being much decayed, the parish contracted with a builder to rebuild it. This person raised the new spire upon the old tower, which being also much decayed, it all fell and destroyed part of the church. The old church was taken down in 1788, JACKSON'S ISLAND, Bermondsey, is about six houses on the south side of YVillow-walk over the ditch.

St. JAMES'S, Garlickhithe, the church of, is situated at the corner of Garlick-hill and Maiden-lane, Upper Thames-slreet, and derives its name from being dedicated to St. James the Apostle, and its addition from its ancient vicinity to the Garlick market of the city. The earliest mention of this church is, that it was rebuilt by Richard de Rothin, sheriff, in 1326. The ancient church was destroyed by the great fire of 1666, the foundation of the present building was laid in 1676, and the church finished in 1682. It is built of stone, is seventy-five feet in length, forty-five feet in breadth, and forty feet in height to the ceiling. The height of the steeple is ninety-eight feet. This steeple much re- sembles those of St. Stephen, in YValbrook, and St. Michael, Royal College-hill, which are three as original, handsome and taste- ful erections of the sort, as any in London. That of St. Stephen has been very happily imitated by Mr. Savage, in his new church at Bermondsey, who has proved himself in that work to be a worthy disciple of the school of YVren. From the body of the church projects a very handsome dial, upon the top of which is a statue of the apostle to whom the church is dedicated. St. JAMES, Duke's-place, the church of, is situated in that part of Duke's-place called the square, and nearly opposite the great Synagogue of the German Jews. Duke's-place is a district covered with lanes and alleys, on a site of part of the once splendid and wealthy priory of the Holy Trinity, founded in 1108, by Matilda, queen of Henry I. Being the richest in England, it was the first that was seized upon by Henry VIII., in 1531, at the period of the dissolution of the religious houses. The King gave it to Sir Thomas Audley, Speaker of the parliament, and afterwards Lord High Chancellor, for his services in opposit'on to Cardinal YVolsey. Sir Thomas demolished the priory, and converted part of it into a large mansion for his own residence. The only daughter of Sir Thomas being married to the Duke of Norfolk, the estate descended to the Duke, and was from that time to the pre- sent known by the name of \" tlie Duke's- place.\" When the Duke was beheaded, the estate descended to his son Thomas Howard, Earl of Suffolk, who sold it in the thirty-fourth year of Queen Elizabeth to the mayor, commonalty and citizens of London. This church is a rectory, the patronage of which appears to have been in the abbot and convent of YVestminster, till the sup pression of their monastery by Henry VIII., when coming to the crown, it was granted by Queen Mary to the Bishop of London and his successors, in whom it still remains. It is in the city, diocese and archdeaconry of London, and in the patronage of the Bishop of that see. Its present rector is the Rev. Charles Goddard, D.D., Arch deacon and Prebendary of Lincoln, Chap lain in Ordinary to His Majesty, Vicar of Bexley, in Kent, and of Louth, in Lin colnshire, who was instituted by the Bishop of London in 1821. The inhabitants of Duke's-place, wish ing to have a parish church to themselves, within their own precinct, applied to the Archbishop of Canterbury, who procured the King's warrant, and prevailed upon the lord mayor, aldermen and common-coun cil, to build them a church with the mate rials of the conventual church, which then remained upon the premises. This was accordingly done, and the church was con secrated and dedicated to St. James, in honour of the reigning king, James L, on the 2d of January 1622. Although the parish is in the ward of Aldgate, it is a precinct within itself, under a minister, two constables, two headboroughs and fifteen jury-men. Duke's-place is now principally inha bited by Jews, who settled therein in the time of Oliver Cromwell. The church having escaped the fire in 1666, still re tains its original form, but the body was rebuilt in 1727- St. JAMES'S, Westminster, the church of, is situated on the south side of Piccadilly, nearly opposite Sackville-street. It owes its origin to the increase of buildings in its neighbourhood, and its parish is a cantlet from that of St. Martin's in the Fields. It was built from the designs of Sir Chris- topher YVren, in the reign of Charles II., and was finished in 1683. It is a perpetual curacy, in the city and archdeaconry of London, and in the pa tronage of the lord mayor and commonalty of London, who instituted the present in- This church may be justly considered, in spite of its mean exterior, as one of the most perfect of its great architect's designs,"], [264, "248 JAM JAM St. JAMES'S PALACE, Westminster, stands on the north side of St. James's- park, and at the western end of Pall-mall. On the place where this edifice stands, was anciently an hospital, dedicated to St. James, originally founded by the citi- zens of London for fourteen single women, who were to live a chaste and devout life. The charity was afterwards considerably increased by new donations. This hospi- tal, which is mentioned in a manuscript of the Cottonian library, so early as in the year 1100, was at length suppressed by Henry VIII., who took it down and built the palace which still retains the name of the original patron saint. It is a very irregular brick building of no exterior beauty. In this edifice our kings resided ever since Whitehall Palace was consumed by fire in 1697, till the south eastern wing was accidentally burned in January, 1809. Since which a part only has been rebuilt, but it was put into ornamental repair during the years 1821-2, and 3. whether it be considered for commodious ness, beauty, or ingenuity of construction. Sir Christopher himself considered it as one of the best contrived of his parochial churches, and so speaks of it in a letter to a friend, which is printed in that rare and scarce work, Parentalia, and again in my Memoirs of Wren, page 430, wherein I have also given a section of its construc tion. It was built at the joint expense of Henry Jermyn, afterwards Earl of St. Al bans, whose name and title are used for two of the neighbouring streets, and of the principal inhabitants of this district. The church was made parochial by act of par liament of the 3d James II. The walls are of brick, with rusticated quoins, facias, architraves and other dressings of Portland stone. The ceiling is arched and beauti fully panelled, supported by Corinthian columns, which divide the interior into a nave and two aisles. The construction of the roof, which is engraved in the before mentioned life of Wren, is singularly in genious and \u0153conomical both of room and of materials ; and it is not too great praise to say that is the most novel, scientific and satisfactory as to results of any roof in existence. St. JAMES'S-PARK, Westminster, is situated between Charing-cross and Buck- ingham Palace. In the reign of Henry VIII. this park was a desolate marshy field ; but that monarch, on building St. James's Palace, enclosed and planted it. Charles II. much improved and enlarged it, under the directions of Le Notre, the celebrated landscape gardener. Succeed- ing kings allowed the people the privilege of walking in it, and William III., in 1699, granted the neighbouring inhabitants a passage into it from Spring Gardens. It remained in this situation till the The interior is 84 feet long, 68 broad, and 40 high, and will contain two thou sand persons.

Soon after articles of agreement were entered into between the Lords of the Privy Council and a committee chosen by the Lord Mayor and Commonalty of the City, and it was agreed for the better managing of the plantation, there should be a company constituted in London, to consist of a governor, deputy governor and twenty-four assistants, to direct what ought to be done on the part of the city, relating to the plantations ; and in pursuance of this agreement, the king, by his letters patent, changed the name of Deny to that of Londonderry, and incorporated the com mittee nominated by the city, by the name of \" The Society of the Governor and Assistants in London of the new plan tation in Ulster, within the realm of Ireland,\" directing that it should consist of a governor, and twenty-four assistants ; whereof the governor and five of the assist ants were to be aldermen, the recorder for the time being to be an assistant, and the deputy governor, with the rest of the assist ants to be commoners. By this charter, the king also granted to the society and their successors, the City, Fort and Town of Londondeny, the whole island of Deny, and all the castles, towns, villages and lands in the County of Londondeny, par ticularly mentioned in the charter. The society now immediately set about rebuilding Londondeny and Colerain, and improving and planting the other parts of the county ; and, in order to reimburse the twelve principal companies, > and other in- ferior companies that had contributed to the expense of the plantation, the society divided the whole county of Londondeny into thirteen parts ; the first consisting of the city of Londondeny and town of Colerain, with some of the adjoining lands, and the fisheries, was retained by the society in their own possession, to defray the charge of the general work of the plantation, and the surplus was from time to time divided among the twelve companies by the society. The rest of the county being divided into twelve parts, as equal in value as possible, the twelve companies drew lots . for them, and each company had the part which fell to its share. The society then erected each lot into a manor, and obtained a charter of the crown to convey to each of the companies the lands fallen to it, -to hold the same in perpetuity.

IRISH CHAMBER, Guildhall-yard, is a newly built brick building at the corner of the new street that leads from Guildhall- yard to Basinghall- street, opposite the New Law Courts. At this office all the business connected with the city's estates in Ireland are transacted. The business is conducted by a com mittee of the corporation, which is called The Irish Society, and is directed by the charter to be elected annually at the Court of Common Council next following the second day of February. The origin of this society is briefly as follows : \u2014 In the reign of Queen Elizabeth the province of Ulster, in the north of Ireland, had been greatly depopulated by the sup pression of several insurrections in that part of the kingdom, and in particular the city of Derry and the town of Coleraine were nearly ruined. To prevent such insunections for the future, it was thought proper to repeople that part of the country with Protestant families ; and soon after the accession of King James I. to the throne of England, that prince, considering this as an affair worthy of his attention, signified his plea sure to some of the aldermen and com moners, by means of several of his privy council, upon which a court of common council was called, and a deputation sent over to view the place of the intended plantation. These deputies being returned, it was agreed in December, 1609, that"], [273, "IRO 257 JUB attorney-general to prosecute the society in the Star Chamber, under pretence that the charter had been suneptitiously obtained ; upon which it was cancelled by a decree of that court, and the lands seized into the king's hands ; but the society were rein stated in their possessions by Oliver Crom well, who granted the city a new charter ; and Charles II. incorporated the society anew, and the companies have enjoyed their possessions ever since. The present members of this society are John Thomas Thorpe, Esq., Alderman and Draper, Governor ; William Day, Esq., Grocer, Deputy- Governor; Newman Knowles, Esq., Recorder ; Sir John Perring, Bart., Alderman and Cloth worker ; Matthew YVood, Esq., Alderman and Fishmonger ; Matthias Prime Lucas, Esq., Alderman and Vintner ; YVilliam Heygate, Esq , Alderman and Merchant Tailor ; YVilliam Taylor Copeland, Esq., Alderman and Goldsmith ; and Messrs. pilasters, a well-proportioned pediment, the arms of the company and other ornaments boldly sculptured in stone. The Ironmongers' Company is the tenth in rotation of the twelve chief companies of the city, and have, of course, a share in the management and property of its Irish estates. This company was incorporated by char ter from Edward 1Y. in 1464, by the name of \" The Master and Keepers, or Wardens, and Commonalty of the Art or Mystery of Ironmongers of London.\" They have con siderable estates both in their own right as a corporation, and in trust from several donors, by whose wills they pay large sums in charities, as fully detailed in the Parlia mentary Report on the Endowed Charities of the City. They have also the distribu tion of the interest of \u00a326,000 left to them in 1 724, by Mr. Thomas Betton, a Turkey merchant, under the special conditions of employing one moiety of the said profits perpetually in the redemption of British captives from Moorish slavery, and the other moiety to be equally divided between the poor of the company and the several charity schools within the bills of mor tality.

Y'essels and craft may be docked or undocked at any time, by the powers of a large steam engine and culvert from the Thames, and vessels of 900 tons register, and others drawing 21 feet water, can be admitted into these docks, where vessels of such a burden had never before been seen so near the Custom house. Vessels are also docked and un docked by night as well as by day, which is not done by any other dock company in the port of London. The Dock Company have also prepared a wharf which possesses 180 feet river frontage, from their lock entrance to the Harbour-master's office, for the accommo dation of steam-vessels, where passengers may land and embark at any time of the tide without being subject to the risk of boat conveyance. Convenient waiting rooms for passengers are constructed, and arrangements made for landing and ship ping caniages, horses, cattle, &c.

The inhabitants afterwards applied to parliament and had the Bf iddlesex liberty of St. Giles, Cripple- gate, assigned to them for their parish. The church was finished in 1732, and was consecrated in the following year, on St. Luke's day, when the name of that apostle was given as its patron. The church is very substantially built of Port- land stone and has an obelisk by way of gate by the same architect. It is under the management of a very efficient committee of governors, and the results are so satisfactory as to make St. Luke's a model to other hospitals of a similar nature.

That see, however, being dis solved by Edward VI., Queen Slary his successor granted the advowson to the Bishop of London and his successors, in whom it still remains. The ancient church was destroyed by the great fire in 1666, after which the present church was erected, from the designs of Sir Christopher Wren. It is a rectory in the city, diocese and archdeaconry of Lon don, and in the patronage of the Bishop of London. The present rector is the Rev. J. B. Bingham, Vicar of Great Gaddes den, who was instituted in 1819. St. BLARTIN VINTRY, the church of, stood near the south corner of Queen-street, Upper Thames-street, and derived its ad- dition from its situation in the Vintry, the ancient mart of the vintners or wine-tun- ners, wine-merchants and coopers ; but sharing the fate of the city in the dreadful fire of 1666, the parish was united to that of St. Blichael Royal, College-hill, by act of parliament [See St. BIichael, Pa- ternoster Roy-al, the church of.

St. B1ARTIN'S-Ct., Charing Cross, is about a quarter of a mile on the left hand in St. Blartin's-lane, going from Charing Cross, and leads into Castle-street, Lei- cester-square. St. BIARTIN OUTWICH, the church of, is situated at the south-east comer of Threadneedle-street, in Bishopsgate-street. It obtained its name from being dedicated to the before-mentioned St. Blartin, and its addition from YVilliam and John de Oteswick, who were anciently its proprie- tors and patrons. In 1325, John de YVar- ren, Earl of Surrey, presented to this living, but dying without issue, it devolved to the Crown, and came afterwards into the possession of the Slerchant Taylors' Com- pany, who have ever since enjoyed the right of patronage. The old church, which was built in 1540, was one of the few that escaped the ra- vages of the fire of London, but it became afterwards so dilapidated by age, and the large fire that consumed much of the ad- jacent property in 1765, that it was taken down in 1795, and the first stone of the present edifice was laid on the 4th of Slay 1796. It is a neat small church, erected from the designs of the late Sir. Cockerel!, and has a fresco painting of the Ascension, by Rigaud, over the altar. The church is a rectory, in the city, diocese and archdeaconry of London, and in the patronage of the Merchant Taylors' Company. The present rector is the Rev. John Joseph Ellis, second master of the Blerchant Taylors' School, who was insti- tuted in 1821. St. SIARTIN'S-LANE, Charing Cross, is at the western extremity of the Strand, and opposite to Northumberland House. St. BIARTIN'S-LANE, LITTLE, is the continuation of the last described. St. BIARTIN'S-LANE, Cannon-street, is the second turning on the right hand in Thames-street, going from London-bridge. St. BIARTIN'S-LE-GRAND, is at the western end of Cheapside, next Newgate- street, and opposite the New Post Office. This street, as far as the end of the New Post Office, near St. Ann's-lane, as well as the courts on the western side, is within its own liberties, and in the government of the City of YVestminster. It derives its name from a collegiate church, founded on its site, by Ingabricus, and his brother, Ed- ward, in 1056, and its addition from the privileges of sanctuary that were granted to it by several successive monarchs, to thieves, ruffians and murderers, which was abolished at the time of the reformation. St. BIARTIN'S-St., Leicester-square, is the middle of the south side, leading to YVhitcomb-street.

MARTIN-St., Whitechapel, is the second turning on the left hand in Essex-street, going from YVhitechapel High-street. St. BIARY ALDERBIARY, the church of, is situated near the middle, and on the east side of Bow-lane, Cheapside, and de- rives its name from being dedicated to the Virgin Slary, and its addition of Alder, to Older or Elder Slary, from its being the oldest church in the city, dedicated to that saint. St. BLARTIN'S WORKHOUSE, St. Mar- tin's-lane, Charing Cross, is nearly oppo. site the church, and extends into Hem. ming's-row. St. MARY ABCHURCH, the church of, is situated near the south end of Abchurch- lane, Cannon-street, and derives its name and addition, from having been dedicated to the Virgin Blary, and Ab or Up church, from its greater elevation than most of its neighbourhood. A church, similarly dedi- cated, stood upon this site in very early times, for we find that in 1448, the pa- tronage of it was in the Prior and Canons of St. Slary Overy, but falling to the crown in the reign of Elizabeth, her ma- jesty granted the perpetual advowson to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, in whom it still remains. In 1510, Sir Henry Keble, Lord Blayor of London, bequeathed \u00a31,000 towards rebuilding the ancient church, which stood on this site, and had become much de cayed by age ; and, in 1626, YVilliam Rodoway gave \u00a33,000 more, and other individuals contributed liberally. The body of the church was destroyed by the great fire of 1666, and was rebuilt, and the tower repaired and cased, by Sir Christo pher YVren, in 1711, at the sole expense of Henry Rogers, Esq., as appears by a Latin inscription over the western door of the church. The ancient church was destroyed by the great fire in 1666, and the present edifice erected shortly afterwards by Sir Christopher YVren. The parish of St. Law rence Pountney was united to this parish after the fire, and the church of that small parish was consequently not rebuilt. The church is a rectory, in the city, diocese and archdeaconry of London, and in the patronage of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. The present rector is the Rev. J. YV. Bellamy. Vicar of Sellinge, and head-master of Merchant Taylors' School. The style is an impure imitation of the pointed style, (which was never understood or relished by our great national architect,) with the absurd addition of a composite altar-piece. The interior is 100 feet in length, 63 in breadth, and 45 in height- The church is a rectory, and one of the thirteen peculiars of the Archbishop of Canterbury. After the fire of London, the adjoining parish of St. Thomas the Apos tle, was united to it by act of parliament ; the patronage of which being in the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul, that of the united parishes is with the Archbishop and Dean alternately. It is a rectory, in the city of London, and in the province of Canterbury. The present rector is the Rev. H. B. YVilson, B.D., formerly one of the masters of Blerchant Taylors' school. St. BIARY', Aldermanbury, the church of, is situated on the west side of the street so called, between Love-lane and Addle- street, Wood-street, Cheapside. It derives its name from its dedication to the Virgin Blary, and its addition from its situation. This church is of very ancient date, as ap- pears from a sepulchral inscription, recorded to have been in the old church, bearing the date of 1116. The patronage was formerly in the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's, who, in 1331, with the consent of Stephen, Bishop of London, appropriated it to the adjoining hospital of Elsing Spital. After the dissolution of the reli- gious houses, the patronage was granted to the parishioners, who have ever since \u00abnjoyed the light of presentation. St. BIARY' -AXE, the church of, stood formerly on the north side of Leadenhall- street, in the street which still preserves its memory by its name. This church was dedicated to the Ylrgin Blary, and received the appellation of \" At the Axe,\" from a sign which hung near its east end. But this parish being united in 1565 to that of St. Andrew Undershaft (see that church), the church of St. Blary was let for a ware- house, till it fell into total ruin, and was taken down.

This church, which was one of the thirteen peculiars within the city, belonging to the Arch- bishop of Canterbury, having suffered greatly by the fire of London, was not re- built, but the parish was united by act of parliament to that of St. Swithin. \u2014 [See that church. St. BIARY' COLECHURCH, the church of, stood in the Poultry, at the south-west corner of the Old Jewry, but suffering the fate of most of the other public buildings in 1666, and not being rebuilt, the parish was united to that of St. Blildred in the Poultry. \u2014 [See that church.

St. SIARY'-LE-BONE, the church of, is situated on the south side of the New-road, directly opposite Y'ork-gate, Regent's-park. The first church of this parish was dedi- cated to St. John, and the second one to the Ylrgin Blary. It derives its epithet originally from being St. Mary at the Bourne, and by corruption, St. Slary-le- bone, or the Good. The first church stood at or near the present Court-house, at the end of Blary-le-bone-lane, near Oxford- street. The second church was built on the site of an ancient chapel, near the upper end of High-street, which became decayed, was taken down, and a new one, now used as a chapel of ease, and called, by way of distinction, \" The Parish Cha- pel,\" erected in its place. This large parish has five splendid churches ; one, the parish or mother church before mentioned, which was erected at the expense of the parishioners, and consecrated in February 1818. It was designed by the late Thomas Hardwick, Esq., who, in this and other of his works, has proved himself a worthy disciple of his master, Sir YVilliam Chambers. It is a rectory, in the diocese of London, in the county and archdeaconry of Sliddlesex, and in the patronage of the crown. The present rector is the Rev. J. Hume Spry, D.D., a Prebendary of Canterbury,and Vicar of Hanbury, who was instituted in 1 825. The other four churches in this parish are,\u2014 I. The church of St. BIARY', Bryanstone-square, was designed by Ro- bert Smirke, Esq., R.A., and consecrated in January 1824. It is a district rectory, in the same ecclesiastical jurisdiction as Engravings and descriptions of these churches are to be found in my work of \" London in the Nineteenth Century.\" There are also several episcopal chapels, or chapels of ease, within this parish, which were erected as follows : \u2014 Oxford Chapel, in Vere-street, designed by James Gibbs, in 1724; Bentinck Chapel, in 1772; Portman Chapel, in 1779 ; Margaret street Chapel, about 1779; and Baker street Chapel and Brunswick Chapel, in Upper Berkeley-street, in 1782. St. John's Wood Chapel, was designed by the late Thomas Hardwick, Esq., and is a curacy in the same jurisdiction and patronage as' the four district churches. The present incumbent is the Rev. Thomas YVharton, SLA. The parish chapel before men tioned is a curacy, also in the same eccle siastical jurisdiction, but in the patronage of the rector of the parish. The present incumbent is the Rev. Richard Henry Chapman, SI. A., Rector of Cuxton, who was instituted in 1823. St. MARY' -LE-BOW, the church of, is situated on the south side of Cheapside, at the corners of Bow-lane and Bow Church- yard. It is dedicated to the Ylrgin Blary, and derives its addition from being the first church built in London upon arches, then called Bows. It was founded in or"], [307, "BIAR 291 BIAR before the reign of YVilliam the Norman, and was at first called New Blary Church, but afterwards received the epithet of De Arcubus, or Le Bow, in Westcheap. In 1271 it was much decayed, and many persons were killed and maimed by the fall of the steeple, which was not completely rebuilt till 1469, when the common-coun cil ordered that Bow bell should be rung at nine o'clock every night. Hence the proverb of Bow bell. The old church was destroyed by the fire of London, and the present edifice erected in its stead by Sir Christopher Wren, in 1671. In that year he began its incomparable spire, which is not only his masterpiece in composition, but stands un rivalled in this class of art, as well for its beauty, as for its ingenious and scientific construction. In 16/7 it was finished, and was repaired about the year 1782, by the late Alderman Sir YVilliam Staines, since then by BIr. Gwilt, senior, and in 1818 to 1820, by his son, BIr. George Gwilt. tween the years 1672 and 1677, by Sir Christopher YVren, the parish of St. An drew Hubbard was united to it by act of parliament [See that church. The advowson of this church appears always to have been in private hands, till about the year 1638, when it was pur chased by the parishioners, but since its union with the parish of St. Andrew Hub bard, the patronage of which is in the Duke of Northumberland, the parish and his Grace present alternately. It is a rectory, in the city, diocese and archdea conry of London, and its present rector is the Rev. YV. J. Rodber, who was insti tuted by the parishioners in 1826. St. BIARY', Lambeth, the church of, is'si- tuated on the south side of the Archbishop of Canterbury's palace, at Lambeth. It is of very ancient date, and was originally built in 1188, by Archbishop Baldwin, but was demolished by order of Pope Urban. It was subsequently rebuilt upon its present site, and stood till 1374, when it was again re-edified. Since which it has been several times repaired, and very substantially about 1819. This extensive parish is divided into eight precincts, denominated, the Arch- bishops, Y'auxhall, Kennington, the Blarsh, the YVall, Stockwell and the Deans. At Lambeth YVall, is a spot of ground, con- taining 1 acre, 19 poles, called Pedler's Acre, which has belonged to the parish from time immemorial, and is said to have been given by a pedler, on condition that his picture, with that of his dog, should be perpetually preserved in painted glass, in one of the windows of the church. This This church is a rectory, and the chief of the thirteen peculiars within the city, belonging to the Archbishop of Canterbury. After the fire of London, the small parishes of Allhallows, Honey-lane, and St. Pancras, Soper-lane (see those two churches), were united to it by act of parlia ment. The advowson of Allhallows is in the Grocers' Company, and that of St. Blary - le-Bow and St. Pancras, in the Archbishop of Canterbury, who therefore present by turns, the Archbishop having two to the Company's one. The united parishes are rectorial, in the city of London, and in the province of Canterbury. The present rec tor is the Rev. Anthony Hamilton, Arch deacon of Taunton, a Prebendary of YVells, Chaplain in Ordinary to His Blajesty, and Rector of Loughton, who was instituted by the Archbishop of Canterbury as his second turn, in 1820.

Under the ancient walls of this church, Slary d'Este, Queen of James II., flying with her infant son, from the ruin that was then hanging over her family, took shelter from the pouring rain of the inclement night of December 6, 1688 ; where she waited for an hour, a melancholy spectacle of fallen majesty, until a coach, procured from a neighbouring inn, arrived, and con veyed her to Gravesend, where she sailed to France. St. BIARY'-AT-HILL, the church of, is situated on the west side of St. Mary's- hill, Lower Thames-street, and is so named from its situation. It is called in ancient records St. Mari\u00e6 ad Montem. This church is of considerable antiquity, since a chantery was founded in it by Rose de Wrytell, in 1330, and Richard de Hack- ney presented Nigellius Dallye to the living in 1337. It was rebuilt in 1497, and was much damaged by the great fire of 1666.

St. BIARY' BIONTHAW, the church of, was situated anciently on the west side of Fish-street-hill, near Queenhithe, and re- ceived its name from its dedication to the Ylrgin BIary, and the family of Montalto, or Monthaul, in the county of Norfolk, who were its original founders and patrons. It was destroyed by the fire of London, and not rebuilt, but the parish was united to that of St. BIary Somerset, by act of parliament [See that church.

The present rector is the Rev. Daniel Blathias, who was instituted in 1807. The original church belonging to this parish is mentioned so early as 1222, when it was called St. Mary, and the Innocents of the Strand. It then stood in a spacious church-yard, on the south side of the Strand, where the eastern wing of Somer set-house is now built ; but was taken down, as is mentioned in the preceding article, and that of St. John the Baptist, in the savoy, (see those articles,) by order of Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, to make way for his palace, named after him, Somerset-house. The parishioners used the chapel of St. John aforesaid, till the act of parliament passed for erecting the fifty new churches, when the first stone of this building was laid on the 25th Feb. 1714, and was finished and consecrated on the 1st Jan. 1723, when instead of its ancient name, it was called St. Blary-le- Strand. This church was the first of the fifty new churches, and was erected from the designs of James Gibbs, architect, to the church of St. Blartin in the Fields. St. BIARY YVOOLCHURCH HAW, so named, from a beam that stood anciently in the church-yard for the weighing of wool, stood on the eastern side of Stock's- market, which is now occupied by the Lord Mayor's Slansion-house.

St. BIARY' YVOOLNOTH, the church of, stands at the north-east comer of Sher- bourne-lane, Lombard-street. Its addition of Woolnoth is derived from being neath, (since, by corruption, noth,) or nigh to the YY'oolstaple. The ancient church was of some antiquity, as John de Norton is mentioned as being rector in 1335. From various circumstances, such as the discovery of the tusks and bones of animals, remains of tesselated pavements, metal vessels, part of an aqueduct, and other Roman exuvi\u00e6, it has been surmised, that an ancient Tem- ple, probably that of Concord, stood upon its site. It was damaged at the time of the great fire of 1 666, and was sufficiently repaired to last till the act passed in Queen Anne's reign to build fifty new churches, when the old church was taken down, and the present handsome substantial edifice built in its stead. It is from the designs of Nicholas Hawksmoor, a disciple of YYrren, and it is worthy of the school in which he was educated. At the time of digging the foundation for the present church, the above-named relics of Roman art were discovered, and a well that was full of rubbish, which, on being cleared out, a fine spring of salubrious water arose, into which the parishioners fixed the pre- ent public pump at the north-west comer.

St. BIARY, Whitechapel, the church of, stands at the eastern end of YVhitechapel High-street, at the south side of the be- ginning of the YVhitechapel, or Blile-end- road. This church is of some antiquity, as appears from Hugh de Fulbourn, being its rector in 1329. It was originally a chapel of ease to the parish of Stepney, and is supposed to have received its epithet white, from the colour of its walls. The ancient name of this church was St. Mary Matfellon, and the township was called Villa Beat\u0153 Mari\u00e6 de Matfellon, a name supposed to be derived from the Hebrew Matfel, which signifies a woman recently delivered of a son, alluding to the birth of Christ, to whose mother it is dedicated. The old church becoming very ruinous, it was taken down in 1673, and rebuilt as at present. It has recently received the addition of an illuminated clock, after the ciently in the patronage of the Prioress and Convent of St. Helen, Bishopsgate, till at their dissolution it fell to the crown ; when Henry VIII. granted it to Sir Blartin Bowes, and it has remained in private hands ever since.

At the reformation, this hospital was purchased by the Mercer's Company, who had the mas- tership ; and the chapel, which has been a part of its establishment ever since, was immediately opened by them to the public, under the name of Blercer's chapel. The hall, chapel and all their appurte- nances, were destroyed by the dreadful fire of 1666, and immediately afterwards rebuilt by the Company from the designs of Sir Christopher YY^ren. The front is enriched with heavy sculptures, which, with the entire pile of buildings from Iron- monger-lane to Frederick-place, in the Old Jewry, have been recently most sub- stantially repaired, under the superinten- dance of George Smith, Esq., the com- pany's architect.

For the better inquiry into the proficiency of the scholars, there are four probation days in the year, on 11th Blarch, the 15th June, the 11th September and the 11th December, if not Sundays, and then on the following day. These examinations, which end in moving the best scholars upwards in the school, are conducted by the masters only. There are also two other examinations, conducted by two judicious men, well learned in the Latin, Greek and Hebrew languages, appointed by the master and wardens. On these days, the master, war dens, court of assistants, and the boys friends are present, and reports are made of their progress. These days are called Doctors' days, because the examinations are generally made by clergymen of that collegiate degree. There is also another principal public examination of the scholars of the upper form, the four principal of which are called monitors. This examination takes place before the President and Fellows of St. John's College, and the Blaster and War dens of the Company ; and occurs on the 1 1 th June, if not on a Sunday. This is called election day, because, after the public examination, and the delivery of orations in Latin and English, the election is made from the scholars to fill up the vacant fellowships. Blerchant Taylors' School, wherein the Editor of this work received whatever share of classical literature he posses ses, has been celebrated for the sound learning of its masters. Among whom was that staunch royalist, William Dugard, who, on the execution of Charles I., re corded his opinion in the public registry of the school, as follows : \u2014 MERCHANT TAYLORS'-HALL, is si- tuated on the south side of Threadneedle- street, and the dining-haH, or banqueting- room, is generally esteemed to be the largest in the City. The Company of Blerchant Taylors' is the seventh in rank among the twelve principal companies of the City. It was anciently called \" Taylors and Linen Armourers,\" and was originally incorpo- rated by letters patent of the 5th Edward IV., in 1406 ; but many of the members of the company being eminent merchants, and Henry VII. one of its members, he re-incorporated it in 1503 by letters patent, under the name of \" The Blaster and Wardens of the Blerchant Taylors of the Fraternity of St. John the Baptist in the City of London.\" This company is pos- sessed of, and are trustees to great estates, out of which they pay to charitable uses, according to the wills of the respective donors, more than \u00a33,000 a year. MERCHANT TAY'LORS' SCHOOL, one of the most eminent seminaries in England, is situated on the eastern side of Suffolk- lane, Cannon-street. It was founded by the Blerchant Taylors' Company in 1561, principally at the suggestion of Richard Hills, who founded the alms-houses on Tower-hill, who gave \u00a3500 for the pur- chase of a house belonging to the Duke of Buckingham, called the Blanor of the Rose, in which the company founded the school. Sir Thomas White, who was a member of this company, and Lord Blayor in 1 553, anxious to make still further provision for the youth educated at this school, founded the College of St. John, at Oxford, prin cipally for their use, as they have forty-six out of fifty-two fellowships in it. That edifice was destroyed by the great fire in 1666, and the present school, the cloisters, the master's house, and other buildings were erected in 1 675, upon the same spot, at the expense of the company, from the designs of Sir Christopher YY'ren, whose father had been educated at the school. The statutes of the school provide that one hundred boys are to be taught Latin, \" Martyr pro divinis patriiaque legibus Opium- sceptigrer Carolus Sceleratorum maiiibus cecidit. Gulielmus Dugard.\" He also inscribed in the same registry, the following inscription for the tomb of Oliver Cromwell's mother :\u2014 \" Mater nati execrabilis hie jacet, Qui duos Reges, triaque regna perdidit.\" Dugard also published Salmasius's De fence of King Charles, for which in Fe, bruary 1649, he was dismissed from his"], [318, "sue MEYV 302 St. BlICHAEL'S-ALLEY, Cornhill, is about eight houses on the right hand, going from Birchin-lane ; it leads into George-yard and Lombard-street.

The ancient church was originally founded about the year 1140, and was then in the patronage of the Prior and Canons of St. Bartholomew, in Smithfield. The London registers give no name of any rector before that of Ralph de YValtham, who died in 1327, when the presentation belonged to Henry Bodyke, citizen of London. But about 1430, it fell to the Dean and Chap- ter of St. Paul's, in whose patronage it has continued ever since. Dugard was again dismissed about ten years afterwards, and with so great a repu tation as an able teaeher, that on opening a school in Coleman-street, he drew around him, in a few months, some hundreds of scholars. Of other masters, I will men tion Townley, Bishop, Cheny and Rose, and among a few shining scholars, who were educated at this sound seminary of use ful learning, were three archbishops, Juxon (who attended the unfortunate Charles I. to the scaffold), Dawes and Gilbert, eight bishops, several judges, and a host of bar risters, physicians, professors and men of letters. The present masters are, the Rev. James William Bellamy, D.D., Head Master, appointed in 1819; the Rev. John Joseph Ellis, BI.A., Second Master, appointed 1795 ; the Rev. John B. Deane, B.A., Third Master, appointed 1824; and the Rev. William Blunt, B.A., Fourth Mas ter, appointed 1824. The old church, which was a beautiful specimen of the ecclesiastical architecture of our ancestors, was entirely destroyed by the fire of London, and the present build ing was erected in its stead, from the de signs of Sir Christopher Wren. It is a plain useful structure, of brick and stone, of no very striking character. The spire has an air of originality, and is skilfully contrived. BIERLIN'S-RENTS, Shoe -lane, are on the south side of St. Andrew's chuch, Hol- born. This church is a rectory, in the city, diocese and archdeaconry of London, and in the patronage of the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's. The present rector is the Rev. Christopher Packe, a Blinor Canon of St. Paul's, who was instituted in 1821. BIERBIAID-Ct., Southwark, is about a furlong on the left hand of the High- street, going from St. Blargaret's-hill to- wards St. George's churh. BIERRET'S-Bldgs., Sun-street, Bishops- gate, are the first turning on the right hand in Peter-street, going from the south side of Sun-street. St. BIICHAEL, Cornhill, the church of, is situated on the south side of Cornhill, up St. Blichael's-alley. Its name, hke that of the preceding, is derived from the saint to which it is dedicated, and from its situation. B1ERTON'S-Ct., Ratcliffe Highway, is at the west end of the high road, by the corner of Ship-alley, YYrellclose-square. The advowson of this church was an ciently in the Abbot and Canons of Eve sham, who, in 1 133, granted it to a priest named Sparling ; hut on the rectory re verting to the convent, they continued its patrons till 1503, when, by a deed, dated December 3, of that year, they conveyed the advowson to the Drapers' Company, in whom it has continued ever since.

BIETROPOLITAN CITY' BIISSIONA- RY SOCIETY', 1827\u2014 [See BIissiona- ry Societies. The ancient church was destroyed, all but the tower, by the great fire of 1666, and was began to be rebuilt by Sir Chris topher Wren, in 1672. Its lofty tower, an humble imitation of that of Blagdalen MEWS, The KING'S \u2014 [See King's Mews, The."], [319, "sue 303 bug College, Oxford, was rebuilt also by YYrren, in 1722. The interior of the church is light and commodious, and is 87 feet long, 60 feet broad and 35 high. The tower, which is, at a distance, one of the most striking ornaments of the city, is 1 30 feet high to the top of the pinnacles. For scientific construction it is unrivalled, for its kind, but Sir Christopher's igno rance of the style, character and beauties of the ancient ecclesiastical architecture of England, his few works of the sort abun dantly proclaim. The church is a rectory, in the city, diocese and archdeaconry of London, and in the patronage of the Drapers' Company. The present rector is the Rev. T. R. Wrench, who was instituted in 1793. since which time it has been in the aron bishops of that see, and is one of the thir teen peculiars within the city, belonging to that archbishop. Among the ancient monuments preserved in this church, is that' of Sir YY^illiam YY'alworth, who slew YY'at Tyler, in Smithfield ; one to the memory of Queen Elizabeth, and the following concise epitaph on the tomb of a pa rishioner : \u2014 \" Here Iveth, wrapt in clay, The body of William Wray, I have no more to say.\" The church is a rectory, in the city of London, in the province of Canterbury, exempt from archidiaconal jurisdiction, being a peculiar, and in the patronage of the Archbishop of Canterbury. The pre sent rector is the Rev. W. YY'. Dakins, D.D., Vicar of Asheldam, who was insti tuted in 1816. St. BIICHAEL, Crooked-lane, the church of, is situated on the east side of Sliles's- lane, Great Eastcheap, and is so called from its dedication and from its immediate vicinity to Crooked-lane, Old Fish-street. This church is of ancient foundation, for John de Borham appears to have been rector, and the church dedicated to St. Blichael, before the year 1304. It was then a very small church, and stood amidst lay-stalls and slaughter-grounds, used by the butchers of Eastchepe-market. In 1336, John Loveken, four times lord mayor of London, obtained a grant of the ground, and built a handsome and capacious church thereon, which received several additions and benefactions from Sir YY'illiam YVal- worth, lord mayor in 1374, and formerly servant to Loveken. St. BIICHAEL, Queenhithe, the church of, named from its saint and situation, stands on the north side of Upper Thames-streets opposite Queenhithe ; which was formerly called Corn-hithe, as all the corn brought from the western parts of the country was landed here. The earliest mention of this church was under the name of St. Miclwel de Corn hithe in 1181, and we find that in 1404 Stephen Spelman, who had served the offices of alderman, sheriff and chamber lain, died, and left part of his estate to found a charity within its walls. The ancient church having been de stroyed by the fire of London, the present structure was erected in its stead, by Sir Christopher YY'ren in 1677- It consists of a well proportioned body, lighted by two series of windows ; the tower is plain, with a well proportioned spire, terminated by a ship by way of a vane, 135 feet from the ground. This vane is emblematical of the corn business formerly done in the parish, and the body of it is said to be sufficiently capacious to contain a sack of wheat. The advowson of this church has been from time immemorial in the Dean and This church having been destroyed by the fire of London, was rebuilt in 1687 by Sir Christopher YY'ren. The interior, which is 78 feet long, by 46 broad, and 32 high, is a fine specimen of a metropolitan parish church, is well lighted by wide and lofty semi-circular headed windows, and the pews well distributed for seeing and hear ing the minister. The tower is of Port land stone, about 100 feet high, crowned with a perforated parapet, with vases at its angles, from the centre of which rises a lofty, well proportioned, and remarkably picturesque steeple, with a clock, a vane and a cross. This handsome church is under sentence of condemnation for stand ing in the line of the New London-bridge, and a bill is now (November 1830), pend ing in parliament to take it down. The patronage of this church was an ciently in the Prior and Convent of Can terbury, in whom it continued till 1408, Chapter of St. Paul's. On its rebuilding after the great fire the parish of Trinity the Less was united to it by act of par liament, [See Trinity- the Less] and the patronage of the latter being in the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury, they present to the united rectory alternately.

The present rector is the Rev. T. L. Strong, who was instituted by the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's in 1822. St. B1ICHAEL-LE-QUERNE, the church of, stood before the fire of London at the west end of Cheapside, between Blow-bladder- street (the short streetfrom the end of Cheap- side to Newgate-street, by St. Blartin's-le- Grand,) and Paternoster-row, and had a nanow passage at the west end. In 1181 it was a chapelry, and the first rector was buried in it in 1461. In ancient records it is called St. Michael ad Bladum, that is at the corn, which became conupted to querne, which is still the old English or Saxon name of a hand corn-mill. It is also in some records called St. Michael de Macello, from its vicinity to the meat market. It must have been, therefore, a place of considerable strength, to have been con sidered a sufficient place of refuge for the queen mother ; and, subsequently, when the rebels got possession of the Tower of London, she again flew thither for secu rity ; and it is supposed that the king accompanied her, for in 1386, when Leon III., King of Armenia, who had been expelled his kingdom by the Turks, fled to England for refuge, this was the resi dence of Richard. It was ever after the appropriated residence of the queens dowa gers of England, when there happened to be such a personage. The church of St. Michael Paternoster Royal, has been a rectory from very ancient date, and the patronage was in the Prior and Canons of Canterbury, as early as 1285, when Hugh de Derby was collated as rector. The old church was pulled down and rebuilt in 1410, when by license from Henry IV., it was made Collegiate of the Holy Spirit and St. Blary, by Sir Richard Whittington, four times mayor, whose mansion was nearly adjoining, for a master, four fellows, clerks, choristers, &c. Contiguous to this new college, which gave its name to its site, he also erected and founded an alms -house, which he called \" God's house,\" (hence the addition Paternoster) or \" hospital,\" for the ac commodation of thirteen persons, one of whom was to be chief, with the appella tion of tutor [See BIercers' Alms Houses and YY'hittington's Col lege.] To forward these views the mayor and commonalty of London, gave, in 1411, a site whereupon the intended college and hospital might be built ; but as the bene volent founder died before the accomplish ment of his work, it was finished, endowed and laws made for its government, by his executors with great fidelity and zeal. The body of this worthy and eminent citizen was buried in his collegiate church, but was not suffered to lie undisturbed, for in the reign of Edward VI., the incum bent of the parish, imagining that Whit tington's beautiful monument was a de- The old church was burned by the fire of London, and the site whereon it stood was by act of parliament laid into the street, and the parish united to that of St. Vedast Foster. \u2014 [See that church. St. BIICHAEL PATERNOSTER ROY'AL, the church of, stands on the eastern side of College-hill, Upper Thames- street. It derives its name from its patron saint, and from its contiguity to the ToweT Royal, that stood anciently at the upper or northern end of College-hill. It was a spacious, strongly fortified and magnificent mansion, belonging to the kings of Eng- land, and supposed to have been founded by Henry I. It was inhabited by Ste- phen, who having called YYrilliam de Y'pres, from Flanders, with a number of his Flemings, to assist him against the Em- press Blatilda, was so satisfied with his services, that he permitted him to build a castellated house for himself, nearly ad- joining at the west end of the church of St. Thomas the Apostle. In the early part of the reign of Edward I. the Tower Royal became the residence of a private individual of the name of Simon Beawmes, but, probably, as a tenant only, for Ed- ward III. bestowed it in the forty-third year of his reign to the College of St. Ste- phen, Westminster. It, however, reverted to the crown, for in the reign of Richard II. it was called the Queen's Wardrobe, as Froissart relates in his Chronicles, that king Richard having in Smithfield over- come all his rebels, he, his lords, and all his company, entered the City of London with great joy, and went to the lady princess, his mother, who was then lodged in the Tower Royal, called the Queens Ward-"], [321, "BIIC 305 BIIC pository of more valuable commodities than his earthly remains, caused it to be broken open ; but, being disappointed of his ex pected prey, he robbed the body of its leaden covering and recommitted it to the tomb.

The tower at the south-west angle of the church is square, and surmounted by a steeple beautifully composed of columns of the Ionic order. It much resembles the two neighbouring steeples of St. James Garlick-hithe and St. Stephen's YY'albrook. These united parishes form one rectory, in the city of London, in the province of Canterbury, and as one of the thirteen pe culiars of that see, within this city, is exempt from archidiaconal jurisdiction. They are under the patronage of the Arch bishop of Canterbury for St. Blichael Royal, and of the Bishop of YYrorcester (whose palace was anciently in Worcester place, in this parish) for St. Blartin Ylntry. The present rector is the Rev. George F. L. Nicolay, Bl.A., one of the brethren of St. Katherine's Hospital in the Regent's park, and vicar of Little Slarlow, who was instituted in 1790. YVhilst this collegiate body was in ex istence, the Blaster and YY'ardens of the Blercers' Company, who were its trustees, nominated the rector for the approbation of the Slonks of Canterbury. It is now one of the thirteen peculiars within this city, belonging to the archbishop of that see. The ancient church, college and alms houses, were all consumed by the great fire of 1666, and the present edifice erected in its stead, by Sir Christopher YY'ren in 1694. It was made parochial for this parish and for that of St. Blartin Ylntry, the church of which was also destroyed by the same fire, and the two parishes united by act of parliament. \u2014 [See St. BIartin Vin try. St. BIICHAEL YY'OOD-STREET, the church of, is situated on the west side of Wood-street, Cheapside. The original church is of some antiquity, as John de Eppewell is recorded to have been rector in 1328. The old church was destroyed in the common conflagration of 1666, and the present church was erected a few years after from the designs of Sir Christopher Wren. The neighbouring church of St. BIary Staining was also destroyed at the same time, and the parish was united to this by act of parliament. The eastern end of this church is ornamented with four Ionic columns raised upon a stylobate, with arches between, and a well-proportioned pediment above, and in the middle of the centre intercolumniation is a circular win- dow over the altar. This spacious and well-proportioned church is a fine piece of construction, and well-wrought masonry, executed by Edward Strong, Sir Christopher's favourite master mason, whose memoirs and works are well recorded in Clutterbuck's.ffistor^o/.H>)'j fordshire. The interior is a large capacious hall, without any column or support but the external walls; is 86 feet long, 48 broad, and 40 high, and lighted by a series of lofty semicircular headed windows. It has a beautiful altarpiece of the Corinthian or der, carved in Dutch wainscot by Grinlin Gibbons, with some exquisite sculptures of wheat and grapes, emblematical of the sa crament of the Last Supper. Over the pedi ment, and in front of the central east win dow, which was built up for the purpose of its reception, is the fine picture of BIary Blagdalen washing the feet of Christ, painted by Wrilliam Hilton, Esq., R.A., keeper of the Royal Academy. This his torical picture, which was purchased from Blr. Hilton by the Directors of the British Institution, after receiving the first histo rical premium from that society, was pre sented to this church by the Directors, at the instance of the Editor of this work, whose family have been domiciled on that spot for many generations ; and a beloved The patronage of this rectory was an ciently in the abbot and convent of St. Albans, till the suppression of the religious houses by Henry VIII., who sold it to YY'illiam Barwell, who in 1558 conveyed it to trustees for the parishioners, in whom it still remains. After the fire of London, the adjacent parish of St. Blary Staining was united to it by act of parliament ; the patronage of which devolving to the crown, after the reformation, it is now in the gift of the Lord Chancellor, and the united rec tory is presented to alternately by his lord ship and the parishioners.

It was originally held inYY'indmill-street, Tottenham-court- road. In 1755 the present substantial and convenient building was erected, and in 1792, through the munificence of a liberal and humane benefactor, an establishment was added for patients afflicted with cancer.

In this place was anciently a lazaretto, or hospital for lepers, denominated the House of Our Saviour Jesus Christ and BIary Blagdalen, to whom Edward VI. granted letters patent, allowing them to beg for their support. The old church was burned down in 1666, and rebuilt in 1683, by Sir Christo pher YY'ren. The front towards Bread street is built of Portland stone, in a pic turesque Italian style, with a large win dow, flanked with panels, and a circular compound pediment at the end of the roof. The four sides of the interior are uniform, each having one window under a spacious arch, from which springs the ceiling. It is divided into a nave and aisles, and is 62 feet long, 36 broad, and 40 high. The advowson of this church was an ciently in the Prior and Canons of St. BIary Overy, but it afterwards came into the family of Sir Nicholas Crispe, and is now in private hands. After the fire of London, the parish of St. Slargaret Bloses (see that church), was united to it by act of parliament ; which church, after many changes from 1105, when Robert Fitzwal ter gave it to the priory of St. Faith, at Horsham, till the suppression of that con vent, by Edward III., as an alien priory, fell to the crown, in whose patronage it has continued to this day. These united parishes are a rectory, in the city, diocese and archdeaconry of Lon don, and in the alternate patronage of the Lord Chancellor, for the crown, and a pri vate individual.

St. BIILDRED IN THE POULTRY', the church of, dedicated to the same saint, as the preceding, stands at the corner of St. Mildred' s-court, on the north side of the Poultry, nearly opposite YY^albrook. It is of ancient foundation, for John de Aswell was collated to it in 1325. The ancient church was burned down in 1666, and the present substantial edifice erected in its stead, by Sir Christopher YY'ren, in 1676, and the parish of St. BIary Cole, or Colechurch, was united to it by act of par- liament.

BUNT, The ROY'AL, Tower-hill, is the large building on the east side of the prin- cipal land entrance and offices of the St. Katherine Dock Company. It derives its name either from munte, Dutch, or myne- tian, Saxon, a place where money is coined. In former times the Kings of England had mints in various places, and so early as Henry I. the English goldsmiths had be- come so eminent as to be frequently em- ployed by foreign princes. In Cromwell's time the celebrated Simon presided at the Blint, and raised the English coinage to a deservedly high rank. The reign of Queen Anne is also another era in our coinage, as is that of George IV., the beauty of whose coins has never been surpassed. The coinage all undergoes a close investigation before the lord chancellor and a jury of goldsmiths, of what is called the trial of the pix, by which its equal purity is ascer- tained. BUNT, The, Southwark, is a district oppo- site the west end of St. George's church, Southwark. On this site stood anciently a magnificent structure belonging to the Duke of Suffolk, which coming to Henry Y'lll., he erected a mint thereon, from which that neighbourhood is still so named. This place was for many years an asylum for debtors, who fled thither with their effects to defraud their creditors, till their fraudulent sanctuary was destroyed by act of parliament. All the coinage of the United King- doms is now executed within the walls of this building, which is a handsome struc- ture of a mixture of Roman and Grecian architecture. The elevation of the build- ing is by the late Sir. Johnson, and the entrances, &c, by Robert Smirke, Esq., R.A., who finished the works. The complex nature of the machinery by which this great national undertaking is conducted, and the care taken to preserve the integrity of the coinage, maybe gathered from the following official list of those under whose superintendence it is con- ducted.

Its entire height from the pavement is two hundred and two feet, which is nearly thirty feet higher than that of Antoninus at Rome ; and is not only the highest, but also the finest isolated column in the world. Its bottom diameter on the upper part of the base is fifteen feet, and contains in its shaft a staircase of black marble, con sisting of three hundred and forty-five steps. On the abacus is a balcony en compassing a moulded cylinder, which supports a flaming vase of gilt bronze.

The other three sides of the pedestal arc covered with inscriptions in the Latin lan guage, for the information of the citizens ; that on the north describes the conflagration of the metropolis, that on the south its restoration, and that on the east the years and persons under whom the works were commenced, continued and brought to per fection. Its learned architect offered an inscrip tion of more elegance, but consisting of less matter of fact and common place, which was rejected for those now inscribed. Another inscription was also cut in Eng lish, on the lower part of the pedestal, which was obliterated in the reign of James II., on account of its insinuations against the papists ; but it was recut with deeper incisions, in a panel formed by the excisions of the former letters, daring the reign of YY'illiam and BIary, where it still remains in its sunken obscurity, more an object of curiosity than belief. This doubly cut inscription is as fol lows : \u2014 This columnar monument w-as in hand from 1671 to 1677, a period considered too long for such a work. This delay was occasioned by the scarcity of stone of good quality and of sufficient dimensions for the work, which was remedied on the com plaint of the surveyor-general by a pro clamation issued by the king in council, which forbid any person to remove any stone from the Isle of Portland without leave of the surveyor- general. \" This pillar was set up in pprpetual re membiance of the most dreadful burning of this Prote-tant city, begun and carried on by the treachery and malice of the Popish faction, in the beginning of September, in the year of our Lord, 16611; in order lo the effecting their horrid plot, for the extirpating the Protestant religion and English liberties, and to introduce Popery and slavery.'1 The work was at length completed, and may be justly reckoned the finest column of its kind in the world. It was at first used by the members of the Royal Society for astronomical experiments, but was abandoned on account of its vibrations being too great for the nicety required in their observations. This occasioned a re port that it was unsafe ; but its scientific construction may bid defiance to the attacks of all but earthquakes, for centuries to come. A motion is now on the books of the Court of Common-council to obliterate this inscription once more. It is singular that YY'ren himself, with all his Protestant feeling, in his rejected inscriptions, pre served in Parentalia, and in my memoirs of that architect, does not even breathe a hint of the \" Furor Papisticus.\" BIONUSIENT-Y'ARD, Fish-street-hill, is the open space by the before-mentioned Blonument, and is so called from its loca- lity.

After the taking down of the city gates, the corporation determined on erecting a new prison, and designs for the present building were prepared by the younger Sir. Dance ; and the first stone was laid on the 23d of Slay, 1770, by the Lord Blayor (Alderman Beckford), who went in state, attended by the sheriffs and several of the aldermen. This was the last public transaction of BIr. Beckford, who died of a rheumatic fever, on the 21st of June following. In June, 1780, the riots known by the name of Lord George Gordon's, or the \"No popery\" riots, lasted, to the eter nal disgrace of the City magistracy of that day, for upwards of a week, and the new prison of Newgate was burned by the drunken incendiaries of the day. It was speedily repaired, and became the city and county prison. In 1783, the execution of criminals that had previously taken place at Tyburn, was removed by the proper authorities to the present spot, in front of this prison. The first execution took place on the 9th of December of that year. Newgate is now the general felon's pri son for the City of London and the County of Bliddlesex. In the north-east corner of the building, or that which is next New gate-street, is the poftion appropriated to those miserable criminals who are under sentence of death. The prison is under good management, but it is too limited in its space for its purposes, and, perhaps, if another felon's prison was erected for the county, and the interior of this newly ar ranged for the city, it might be sufficient. It is under the management of a special committee of the court of aldermen, and of a general committee, as to the expenses, consisting of the lord mayor, all the alder men, the chairman of the committees of City Lands, Thames Navigation, Coal and Corn, and general purposes, together with one common-councilman for each ward ; BIr.

NEWGATE, The PRISON OF, is situ- ated at the corner of Newgate-street, and the Old Bailey, and derives its name from the ancient city gate so called, which stood across Newgate-street, between Aldersgate and Ludgate. This ancient gate is sup- posed to have been so called, because it was erected in the reign of Hemy I., several hundred years after the construction of the four original city gates. It is, however, so called in ancient records, from which it appears that it was a common gaol for felons, as early as 1218, and that so lately as 1457, Newgate, and not the Tower, was the prison for the nobility and great officers of state. Being much damaged by the fire of London, it was repaired and beau- tified by Sir Christopher YY'ren, in 1672.

It underwent a substantial repair in the reign of James I., under the superintendance of Inigo Jones, who added to it the incon- gruity of one of the finest Corinthian por- ticoes of modern times.

In 1673, YVren commenced preparations for the new building, and submitted va rious designs for the inspection of the King and the commissioners. He also made the beautiful model, which is still preserved in an apartment over the Blorning Prayer chapel of the cathedral, a plan of which, engraved by Lowry, is given in my Life of YY'ren. This plan was deservedly a favourite with its author, and is in many respects superior to the one that is exe cuted. The present one is said to have been constructed on the Roman Catholic cathedral plan, through the influence of the king's brother, James, Duke of Y'ork, who wished to have it ready for the revival of the Popish service. The architect, it is said, shed tears at its rejection, and com plied with the royal mandate with regret. On the 12th of November 1673, Wren received the appointment of architect to, and one of the commissioners for the re building of the cathedral church of St. Paul. In the beginning of 1675, the works were commenced, and his skilful and scientific master mason, Thomas Strong, made his first contract with the commissioners. By the end of the year the designs were approved, received the signature of the king, and the commis sioners ; and the architect was allowed to make such variation and improvements as he pleased. The work of destroying the ruins of the ancient structure was also \u25a0 commenced, first by exploding with gun powder, then by the use of the battering ram. The first stone of the new cathedral was laid on the 21st of June 1675, by the architect and his lodge of Freemasons. The trowel and mallet used on this occa sion, are still preserved in the Lodge of Antiquity, of which Sir Christopher was Blaster. In 1678, Compton, Bishop of London, issued an address, exhorting all persons to contribute with liberality to wards this national undertaking, and his exhortation was eminently successful. In 1678 the architect set out the piers and pendentives of the great cupola, when the oft-told incident occurred of his acci-"], [348, "332 PAU PAU dentally using a fragment of a tomb-stone, with the word \" resurgam\" inscribed upon it. pola, was laid by his eldest son, Christo pher, attended by their Lodge of Free masons, and with due ceremony. In this year, the celebrated controversy began, about the frauds and abuses at St. Paul's, over which the architect so completely triumphed, and in 1718, in the 86th year of his age, and in the 49th of his office as Surveyor-General of the Public Buildings, was this great man displaced from his office to make room for an intriguer of the name of Benson, who has been consigned by Pope, to the most distinguished ho nours of the Dunciad. After the death of Charles II., his suc cessor, James II. issued a new commission to continue the works, dated February 6, 1684, that of Charles having become void by bis death. In this instrument the name of the architect was introduced, as before, and the works proceeded with unabated activity. By the latter end of April 1685, the walls of the choir, with its aisles, being 170 feet long, and 120 feet broad, with the stupendous arched vaults of its crypt were finished, as also the new chapter-house and vestries. The two beau tiful circular porticoes of the transepts, which are among the masterpieces of mo dern architecture, were also brought to the same height, and were all built of large blocks of Portland stone. The cathedral was left almost untouched till the reign of George III., when Ro bert Blylne was appointed its conservating architect, and since then C. R. Cockerell, Esq., A.R.A., who has so scientifically re stored the ball and cross. St. PAUL'S-CHAIN, St. Paul's Church- yard, is a small street about fifteen houses on the right hand from Ludgate-street and extends to Doctors'-Commons. In June 1688, the year of our glorious revolution, the building of the cathedral had advanced so far, that the commis sioners announced that they had contracted for the timber for roofing the aisles of the choir, which were now ready to receive them. The choir was reported to be finished in 1694, as far as the stone work, and the scaffolding was struck. In the course of the following year, YY'ren pub lished his friend, Robert Bayle's, Discourse against customary Swearing, and affixed an order from himself and his brother commissioners, against such an abuse of language by the workmen employed in and about St. Paul's. St. PAUL'S CHURCH - Y'ARD, is the area round the cathedral of St. Paul, with the newly built school of St. Paul at the eastern end. St. PAUL'S COLLEGE, is in a small court, near the Deanery, in St. Paul's Church-yard, about three houses on the left hand side, going to Ludgate-hill from St. Paul's Chain. It consists of tene- ments appropriated to the Blinor Canons of the cathedral, who were incorporated by letters patent in the 18th of Richard II. On the 2d of December 1696, the choir of the new cathedral was opened for divine service on the day of the public thanks giving for the peace of Ryswick, and the Bishop of Salisbury (Gilbert Burnet) preached before the King and a numerous court. St. PAUL, Covent Garden, The church of, is situated on the western side of Covent Garden Blarket, and was erected by the Earl of Bedford, as a chapel of ease to St. Blartin's in the Fields, for the con- venience of his neighbouring tenantry, which were then much on the increase. It is in the form of a Y'itruvian Tuscan temple, and was designed by Inigo Jones. In 1638, as appears from a manuscript in the Harleian collection at the British BIu- seum, printed in the Gentleman's Blaga- zine of November, 1789, a dispute had arisen between the above named earl and the vicar of St. Blartin in the Fields, relative to the right of patronage to this newly built church, and that it was heard before the Privy Council, who determined that it should he a chapel of ease to St. Blartin's, till an act of parliament should be passed to make it parochial. It was then consecrated by Juxon, Bishop of London, on the 27th of September, 1828. On February 1, 1699, the beautiful chapel, at the north-west portion of the cathedral, now called and used as the Blorning Prayer chapel, was opened for divine service, with appropriate ceremony, and in 1708 the general works of the ca thedral had proceeded so near towards completion, that on the 23d of February that year, Sir Humphrey Blackworth, brought up from the committee to the House of Commons, a report as to the covering of the cupola, and laid several estimates for it, before the House of Com mons.

It is a rectory, in the county of Bliddle sex, in the diocese of London, exempt from archidiaconal visitation, and in the patronage of the Dean of St. Paul's. The present incumbent is the Rev. Charles YY'ebb Le Bas, Prebendary of Lincoln, and Y'icar of Darfield, who was instituted in 1812. The church was built by Inigo Jones, by direction of the earl, as a mere barn, to which the architect replied that it should be the handsomest barn in Europe. The walls were of brick, but were cased with stone about the year 1 788 and with other repairs cost ,\u00a311,000. In 1795, the roof and interior was consumed by fire, which have been since substantially repaired and reinstated by the late Thomas Hardwick, Esq. By the before-mentioned act, the patron has the privilege of nominating one of the churchwardens, the rector another and the parishioners elect a third. The church is by the same authority a rectory, in the county and archdeaconry of Bliddlesex, in the diocese of London, and in the patronage of the Duke of Bedford. The present rector is the Rev. F.

It was erected and founded in 1737, by Henry Raine, Esq., who having acquired a con- siderable fortune as a brewer, near Prussian, or Pruson's Island, YY'apping, endowed it by deed of gift, with a perpetual annuity of \u00a3240 a year, and the sum of \u00a34000 to be laid out in a purchase. The children of this hospital, which con- tains fifty boys and fifty girls, are selected from a preparatory school, called the old school, also built and endowed by the same liberal benefactor in 1719. They ' are taught reading, writing, and the girls, in addition, needle and household work, in order to qualify them for service, to which they are put, when they have been three years on the foundation. He also bequeathed \u00a3100 to two girls to be drawn for out of six, as a wedding portion, under certain regulations, which are printed at length, together with a copy of the founder's will, and other interesting particulars in Highmore's Pietas Londi- nensis, and \u00a35 to each for a wedding en- tertainment. BIr. Highmore says, he re- collects, with great satisfaction, to have been an invited guest on the 1st of Blay, (the wedding anniversary,) some years since, when the Rev. Dr. Blayo was rector, and presided, according to the provisions of the will. A large company was assem- bled, and, at a suitable time, after dinner, silence was proclaimed, and two of these brides,with their husbands, were announced and led to the chair, when they were ad- dressed by their venerable pastor in lan- guage of affectionate interest for their welfare, and were presented with their respective purses, accompanied with recom- mendations of prudent management and earnest wishes for their prosperity. He further observes, that their modesty and delicacy were very conspicuous through the joy, which their recent maniage, and the weight of so large a benefaction had excited ; and the company bore their testi- monies of congratulation on their success. The trusts of Sir. Raine's will have been sanctioned by a decree in the Court of Chancery, on the 4th Slarch, 1740, and an act of parliament was afterwards ob- tained to incorporate the trustees, and to enable them the better to fulfil the duties of the trusts reposed in them by the foun- der's will.

It is on the site of an ancient palace, built by Peter, Earl of Savoy and Richmond, in 1245, and afterwards transfened to the friars of Blountjoy, of whom Queen Elea- nor, wife of Henry III., purchased it for her son, Henry, Duke of Lancaster, who, in 1328, enlarged and beautified it, so that it exceeded in magnificence every other structure in the kingdom. It was in this palace, that John, King of France resided, when a prisoner in England, in 1357. This edifice, with all its furniture, was burned by the Kentish rebels, out of pique to John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster ; but the ground devolving to the crown, Henry VII. began to rebuild it as an hospital for distressed poor. Henry VIII. granted it in 1513, to the Bishop of Win- chester and others, executors of his father's will, and constituted them a body corpo- rate and politic, under the name of \" The Hospital of King Henry VIE, late King of England, of the Savoy.\" It was suppressed in the reign of Ed- ward VI., and its revenues, amounting to \u00a3529 15s.

This church is supposed to have been founded about 1 100, at which time a par- ticular devotion was paid to the Holy Se- pulchre. It was so decayed in the reign of Edward IV. as to require re-building. In the reign of Henry I. it was given by the Bishop of Salisbury to the Prior and Canons of St. Bartholomew, in Smithfield. At the dissolution of that ministry it came to the crown, till it was granted by James I. to Francis Phipps and others.

SESSIONS' HOUSE, The, Clerkenwell- green, is a public building used for similar purposes as the preceding, and for the meetings of the magistracy of the County of Bliddlesex. It is sometimes called Hicks's Hall, from an ancient building in the middle of St. John-street, formerly used for these purposes, and which had been given in 1611, to the County, by Sir Baptist Hicks. This building having be- come ruinous, the County obtained an act of parliament in 1779, to build a new one, which was done on the present site, from the designs of BIr. Rogers. The first stone was laid on the 20th of August 1779, and it was opened for business in 1782. The church was much damaged by the great fire of 1666, when it was repaired, and the present ugly and inappropriate arched ceiling introduced, which it will be well to remove, and restore to its former beautiful construction whenever another repair be necessary. It is a vicarage, in the city, archdeaconry and diocese of Lon don, and in the patronage of St. John s College, Oxford. The present rector is the Rev. John Natt, who was instituted in 1830.

It was anciently a village situated by the side of the Roman military high- way, called by the Saxons Eald (that is Old) street. The name of this village is of great antiquity, for John de Sordich or Sordige, its lord, was sent on an important embassy to Pope Clement III., by Edward III., in 1343. The popular legend of its deriving its name from Jane Shore dying in a ditch in its vicinity, is therefore a po- pular error, and the vulgar pronunciation of Sorditch the most conect [See St. Leonard, Shoreditch. YY'hen archery was much in vogue, the captain of the London archers was always honoured with the title of the Duke of Shoreditch, from the circumstance that when Henry VIII. appointed a grand shooting match at YY'indsor, it was won by a citizen of London, named Barlow, an inhabitant of Shoreditch, who far out-shot all the rest.

From him it passed into a family named Lee, one of whom presented to it in 1474, and afterwards gave it to the Grocers' Company, in whom the patronage has remained ever since. The old church was destroyed by the great fire of 1666, and the present much celebrated edifice erected its place, by Sir Christopher Wren. The first stone was laid on the 16th of October, 1672, in the presence of the Lord Blayor, (Sir George Waterman,) several members of the Gro cers* Company, the surveyor-general, (Sir Christopher YVren,) and other persons of distinction. It was built at the public ex pense, except the wainscotting and pewing, which were given by the Grocers' Com pany, the patrons of the living. This church is reckoned by many per sons to be Wren's masterpiece ; but, how ever ingenious it may be in its plan, and excellent in construction, the panelling and foliage of the cupolas are in bad taste, parts of the vaulting are too complicated for real beauty, and are much inferior in design and execution, to some of the ex quisite examples in St. Paul's. The plan is extremely simple, yet the church is not calculated to contain so numerous a con gregation, as its dimensions, 75 feet by 56 feet, would wanant. The beauty of the interior of this church arises from its light ness and elegance ; and the character of its architect is elevated, by its singular origi nality. On entering from the street, up a flight of a dozen or more of steps, through a vestibule of dubious obscurity, on opening the handsome folding wainscot doors, a halo of dazzling light flashes at once upon the eye, through the central aperture of the cupola ; and a beautiful anangement of exquisitely proportioned Corinthian co lumns appear before you. The spacious cupola, and supporting arches expand their airy shapes, springing from almost a point over each of the sunounding columns, upon an architrave cornice of great beauty. The columns are elevated upon pedestals, which are concealed by the pewing, which is moulded into similar proportions ; and form when the doors are closed, a species of stylobate. Over the entrance is the organ and charity children's gallery, and in the corresponding and opposite arcade is the altar ; over which is West's fine histo rical picture of the Stoning of St. Stephen. The order of the composition of this elegant church, the arrangement of its parts, and the effect of the whole, show the originality of YVrcn's mind in a striking STEER'S-Pl., Barbican, is about ten houses on the right hand side, going from Alders- gate-street. St. STEPHEN'S CHAPEL, Westminster. \u2014 [See House of Commons. St. STEPHEN, Coleman-street, the church of, is situated near the south end of the west side of this street, and derives its name and addition from its dedication to St. Stephen, the protomartyr, and from its situation. This church is of great anti- quity, and was originally a chapel belong- ing to the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's, who, between 1171 and 1181, granted it to the Prior and Abbot of Butley, in Suffolk. It was made parochial in 1456, under the patronage of the said prior and abbot, till its suppression by Henry VIII., when it came to the crown. In 1577 Queen Elizabeth granted the patronage, together with the church and rectory, to Thomas Paskins and others ; and in 1590, to William Daniel, serjeant at law, and other parishioners ; which rectory impro- priate, and right of advowson, have been held by the parish, in fee farm of the crown, ever since. The ancient church shared the common fate in the great fire of 1666, and the pre sent structure was finished in 1676, from the designs of Sir Christopher Wren. The advowson is a vicarage, in the city, arch deaconry and diocese of London, and in the patronage of the parishioners. The present incumbent is the Rev. Josiah Pratt, who was elected by the parishioners in 1823. St. STEPHEN, Walbrook, the church of, is situated at the north-east corner of YValbrook, and is dedicated, like the pre- ceding, to the patronage of St. Stephen. There is mention in ancient records of a church dedicated to the same saint, near this spot, but on the opposite side of the brook, prior to 1135. In 1428, Robert Chicheley, Blayor of London, purchased the ground now occupied by the present church and cemetery of the Grocers' Company, and the new church was finished in 1439. In 1432, Robert Whittington, Citizen and Draper, Knight of the Bath, purchased the advowson from the Duke of Bedford."], [394, "STE 378 STO point of view, and its excellencies as a whole, swallow up the trifling fault of the detail.

The parish of St. Bennett Sherehog (which see) was united to this parish after the fire of London, and these united parishes form a rectory ; but as the living of St. Bennet's came to the crown at the dissolution of the monasteries, the Lord Chancellor and the Grocers' Company pre sent alternately.

Richard III. made some ad ditions to the Tower, and Henry VIII. repaired the YY'hite Tower, which was re built in 1638, and after the restoration it was thoroughly repaired under the super intendence of Sir Christopher YY'ren, and a great number of additional buildings made to it. In 1663, the ditch was cleansed, all the wharfing about it was rebuilt of brick and stone, and sluices made for ad mitting and retaining the Thames water, as occasion might require. During some repairs under Sir Chris topher YY'ren, in 1675, the remains of what were supposed to be the two young princes, who were smothered in the Tower by order of Richard III., were discovered, about ten feet below the surface of the TOTHILL-FIELDS SCHOOL, is in Tothill-fields aforesaid.

In 1695, YY'ren reported to the Council the condition of the Tower and its fitness to receive prisoners of state ; the reports of which are printed from the' above named manuscripts, in the life of that architect. The present area of the Tower within the walls, is twelve acres and five poles, and the circuit outside of the ditch, 1052 feet.

TRINITY' - HOUSE, The CORPORA- TION OF, is a society founded, in 1512, by Sir Thomas Spert, commander of the great ship, Henry Grace de Dieu, and Comptroller of the Navy to King Henry VIII. It was incorporated on the 20th of Slay, 1515, for the better regulation of seamen, and the convenience of ships and mariners on our coast ; when the ancient rights and privileges of the company of mariners of England, and their several pos- sessions at Deptford, was confirmed to them. These, together with several grants of Queen Elizabeth and Charles II., were afterwards confirmed by letters patent of James II., dated the 8th of July, 1685, by the name of \" The Master, Wardens and Assistants of the Guild or Fraternity of the most glorious andnndivided Trinity, and of St. Clement's in the Parish of Deptford Strond, in the County of Kent.\" The corporation and court of assistants are invested with the following powers : \u2014 1.

TRINITY' CHAPEL, Conduit-street, Han- over-square, is a small neat building on the south side of the street, near New Bond- street. It was originally a wooden field chapel, erected by James II., and went upon wheels, for the purpose of being con- veyed wherever his majesty went, it being fitted up for his private masses. In 1686, it was in his camp at Hounslow-heath, where it remained until some time after the revolution, when it was removed to its present site. Here it remained and was used as a chapel by the neighbouring in- habitants until 1716, when it was demo- lished and the present building erected in its stead. TRINITY' HOSPITALS, Deptford, are two charitable institutions belonging to the corporation of the Trinity-house, one of which was erected in the reign of Henry VIII,, and is commonly called the Trinity House of Deptford Strond. This Old Hospital, as it was called, is known to the the public by an engraving published by Gribelin, in 1701, and consisted of twenty- one apartments ; but being taken down in 1788, it was rebuilt and the number in- creased to twenty-five. It stands near the church of St. Nicholas. The other is in Church-street, and is called Trinity Hospital. It was built about the end of the seventeenth century, and contains fifty-six apartments. In the centre of the quadrangle, before the build- ing, is a statue of Captain YY'illiam Blaples, service 7- Granting licenses to poor sea men (non-freemen) to row on the river Thames for their support, and sundry other similar privileges.

TRINITY', Minories, the church of, is situated in the Little Blinories. It stands on part of the ancient convent of the nuns of St. Clare, called the Blinoresses, that was founded in 1239, by Edmund Earl of Lancaster, brother of Edward I. This being suppressed, in 1539, a number of houses were erected on its site, and a small church was built for the inhabitants, and dedicated to the Holy Trinity, whence it derived its name, and its addition from its situation. This church was rebuilt in a plain substantial manner, in 1708, and is the family burial-place of the Legges, Earls of Dartmouth, to one of whose an- cestors, a house called the king's, was granted by Charles II. The curate of this parish, for it is neither a rectory nor vicarage, holds the living by an instrument of donation under the great seal of England.

YY'ATERLOO-BRIDGE, is a substantial bridge, built over the Thames, from the Strand to Lambeth, a little westward of Somerset-place. BE Dupin, the celebrated French engineer, calls this bridge, in his Blemoir on the Public YY'orks of England, \" a colossal monument worthy of Sesostris and the C\u00e6sars.\" It was erected by a joint-stock company, under the superin- tendance of the late John Rennie, Esq., from the designs of BIr. George Dodd. The act for incorporating this company, was passed in June 1809; in July 1813, they obtained a second act, and in 1816, a third act, by which the bridge is named \" Waterloo,\" in honour of that great and decisive victory. This bridge consists of nine elliptical arches, with useless and inappropriate Gre- cian Doric columns between the piers, sur- mounted by the anomalous decoration of a balustrade upon a Doric entablature. The road way upon the summit of the arches is level, in a line with the Strand, and is car- ried by a gentle declivity, upon a series of brick arches, over the road way on the Surrey bank of the river, to the level of the roads near the Obelisk, by the Suney theatre.

The width of the river, in this part, is 1326 feet, at high water, and is covered by nine elliptical arches, of 120 feet span, and 35 feet high, supported on piers 20 feet wide, at the springing of the arches. The entire length of this bridge is 2456 feet, the bridge and abutments being 1380 feet, the approach from the Strand 310 feet, and the causeway, on the Suney side, as far as supported by the land arches, 766 feet.

WATERBIANS' HALL, St. Mary at Hill, formerly stood in Cold Harbour, and was removed to this spot, and the present neat hall erected, in 1786. It is a pretty de- sign, of brick and stone, upon a rusticated ground story, with the arms of the Com- pany, sculptured in stone, over the door. The YVatermen do not appear to have had any charter of incorporation before the reign of Philip and Blary, when they were established by an act of parliament, which enacts that out of the Watermen between WEAVERS' HALL, is in Basinghall- street, about twenty houses on the right hand side of the street, going from Cat- eaton-s trees. The YVeavers' Company is very ancient, and appears to be one of the first incorpo- rated fraternities in the City of London. The YY'eavers were originally called \" The- narii,\" and in the reign of Henry I. they paid \u00a316 a year to the crown for their im- munities. Their privileges were afterwards confirmed to them at Winchester, by letters patent of Henry II., which are still in the Company's possession. The Company originally consisted of cloth and tapestry weavers, and by an act of the 7th of Henry IV., they were put under the ma- nagement of the lord mayor and aldermen of the City. Gravesend and Windsor, eight overseers dr rulers are chosen by the Court of Alder men of the City of London, to keep order among the rest.

The next prince who improved this national building was Henry III., who added to, and much repaired it. These repairs were completed by his suc cessor in 1285, which is the date cf the building as it now stands. About 1502 King Henry VII. began the splendid chapel that is called by his name. This chapel, like that of Henry III., which he pulled down to make room for it, he dedicated to the Virgin Blary, and designed it for a burial place for him self and his posterity. At the time of the suppression of the religious houses, the Abbey was surrender ed to Henry VIII., who dissolved it, and erected it into a college of secular canons, under the government of a dean. Blary restored it to its original conventical state, and Queen Elizabeth finally ejected the monks, and in 1560 erected the Abbey into a college as at present.

Besides these a great number of the sons of the nobility and gentry are educated here, which has ren- dered it one of the most celebrated schools in the kingdom. A certain number of the king's scholars are sent, when qualified, to the Universities, namely, to Trinity Col- lege, Cambridge and to Christchurch, Oxford.

YY'HITEFRIARS, is a district of the city, which extends from the western side of Water-lane, Fleet-street, to the Temple, and from Fleet-street to the Thames. It derives its name from being the site of the ancient Convent of 'Carmelites, or White- friars, who were so called from their white garments. This convent was founded in 1241, by Sir Richard Grey, ancestor of the Lord Greys, of Codnor, in Derbyshire, and was afterwards rebuilt about 1350, by Hugh Courtney, Earl of Devonshire, when the ground given to the order by Edward I. to enlarge their buildings was taken in. The conventual church was built by Sir Robert Knowles, a great warrior in the reigns of Edward III. and Richard II., and it was the burial place of many persons of distinction.

YVHITECHAPEL-BIARKET, is a con- siderable meat market, on the south side of the street. At the dissolution of the religious houses, in the reign of Henry Y'lIL, this convent and its church were sunendered to the crown, and the king conferred different portions of the buildings to his favourites ; and in 1557 Edward VI. granted the church, chapter house, and other parts of the priory to the Bishop of Worcester and his successors. YVHITECHAPEL-ROAD, extends from the church to the beginning of Mile-end. YVHITECHAPEL YVORKHOUSE, Whitechapel-road, is about a quarter of a mile on the left hand side of the road below the church. In 1608, the inhabitants of this district obtained several liberties, privileges and exemptions, by a .charter granted them by James E, which placed them out of the jurisdiction of the City of London. This soon rendered the place an asylum for in solvent debtors, cheats and gamblers, who gave it the name of Alsatia, which figures so conspicuously in Sir YY'alter Scott's lively tale of the Fortunes of Nigel. The inconvenience became at last so intolerable, that in 1696 an act of parliament was passed to deprive the district of privileges that were so injurious to the community. WHITECHAPEL SCHOOL, is a free school, founded by the Rev.
