CHAPTER I. To be ever active in laudable pursuits, is the distinguish ing characteristic of a man of merit. Never put off till to-morrow what can be done to-day. Or, since we are not sure of a single moment, do not defer till the next hour that which can be performed in the present, unless the doing it, or leaving it undone, are objects of equal insignificance. The nimble runner courses Fortune down, And then he banquets, for she feeds the bold. There is an heroic innocence, as well as an heroic courage. There is a mean in all things. Even virtue itself has its stated limits * which not being strictly observed, it ceases to be virtue. No revenge is more heroic, than that which torments envy, by doing good. The discretion of a man deferreth his anger, and it is his glory to pass over a transgression. Money, like manure, does no good till it is spread. There is no real use of riches, except in the distribution ; the rest is all conceit. A wise man will desire no more than what he may get justly, use soberly, distribute cheerfully, and live upon con tentedly. A contented mind, and a good conscience, will make a man B"], [16, "2 SELECT SENTENCES. happy in all conditions. He knows not how to fear who dares to die. There is but one way of fortifying the soul against all gloomy presages and terrors of mind, and that is, by secur ing to ourselves the friendship and protection of that Being who disposes of events and governs futurity. CHAPTEE II. Without a friend the world is but a wilderness. A generous friendship no cold medium knows, Glows with one love, with one resentment glows ; One should our interests, one our passion be ; My friend should hate the man that injures me. Pope's Homer. If you have one friend, think yourself happy. When once you profess yourself a friend, endeavour to be always such. He can never have any true friends that will be often changing them. Nothing more engages the affections of men than a hand some address and graceful conversation. Complaisance renders a superior amiable, an equal agree able, and an inferior acceptable. Ingratitude is a crime so shameful, that the man was never yet found who would acknowledge himself guilty of it. Truth is born with us, and we must do violence to nature tp shake off our veracity. There cannot be a greater treachery than first to raise a confidence and then deceive it. No man has a thorough taste of prosperity to whom ad versity never happened. It is as great a point of wisdom to hide ignorance as to discover knowledge."], [17, "3 SELECT SENTENCES, CHAPTER III. As to be perfectly just is an attribute of the divine nature, to be so to the utmost of our abilities is the glory of man. No man was ever cast down with the injuries of Fortune, unless he had before suffered himself to be deceived by her favours. Anger may glance into the breast of a wise man, but rests only in the bosom of fools. None more impatiently suffer injuries than those that are most forward in doing them. A more glorious victory cannot be gained over another man than this, that when the injury began on his part the kindness should begin on ours. The prodigal robs his heir, the miser robs himself. To mourn without measure is folly \u2022 not to mourn at all, insensibility. The coin that is most current among mankind is flattery ; the only benefit of which is, that by hearing what we are not, we may be instructed what we ought to be. The character of the person who commends you is to be considered before you set a value on his esteem. The wise man applauds him whom he thinks most virtuous, the rest of the world him who is most wealthy. The temperate man's pleasures are durable, because they are regular ; and all his life is calm and serene, because it is innocent. The love of gaming will corrupt the best principles in the world. CHAPTER IV. He that is truly polite, knows how to contradict with respect and to please without adulation, and is equally remote from an insipid complaisance and a low familiarity. When Darius offered Alexander ten thousand talents to B 2"], [18, "4 SELECT SENTENCES. divide Asia equally with him, he answered, The earth cannot bear two suns nor Asia two kings. Parmenio, a friend of Alexander, hearing the great offers Darius had made, said, Were I Alexander I would accept them. So would I, replied Alexander, were I Parmenio. Though an honourable title may be conveyed to pos terity, yet the ennobling qualities, which are the soul of greatness, are a sort of incommunicable perfections, and cannot be transferred. If a man could bequeath his virtues by will, and settle his sense and learning upon his heirs, as certainly as he can his lands, a noble descent would then indeed be a very valuable privilege. CHAPTER V. Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, but not so many as have fallen by the tongue. Well is he that is defended from it and hath not passed through the venom thereof; who hath not drawn the yoke thereof; nor been bound in her bonds ; for the yoke thereof is a yoke of iron, and the bands thereof are bands of brass ; the death thereof is an evil death. My son, blemish not thy good deeds, neither use uncom fortable words when thou givest anything. A friend cannot be known in prosperity, and an enemy cannot be hidden in adversity. The friend thou hast, and his adoption tried, Grapple him to thy heart with hooks of steel ; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatch' d, unfledged comrade. Whoso discovereth secrets loseth his credit and shall never find a friend to his mind. Honour thy father with thy whole heart, and forget not the sorrows of thy mother ; how canst thou recompense them the things they have done for thee '?"], [19, "5 SELECT SENTENCES. To labour, and to be content with that a man hath, is a sweet life. Be in peace with many ; nevertheless, have but one coun sellor of a thousand. Let reason go before every enterprise, and counsel before every action. CHAPTER VI. The latter part of a wise man's life is taken up in curing the follies, prejudices, and false opinions he had contracted in the former. Censure is the tax a man pays to the public for being eminent. Party is the madness of many, for the gain of a few. To endeavour to work upon the vulgar with fine sense, iB like attempting to hew blocks of marble with a razor. Superstition is the spleen of the soul. He who utters a falsehood is not sensible how great a task he undertakes : for he must be forced to invent twenty more to maintain that one. The surest mode of escaping the temptation to commit a falsehood is never to be guilty of any act which we are either afraid or ashamed to own ;\u2014 as the safest way to avoid run ning in debt, is never to think of purchasing any article when we have not the money demanded for it. There is nothing wanting to make all rational and disin terested people in the world of one rehgion, but that they should talk together every day. Men are grateful in the same degree that they are resent. fui. Economy is no disgrace ; it is better living on a little than outliving a great deal. Next to the satisfaction I receive in the prosperity of an honest man, I am best pleased with the confusion of a rascal."], [20, "6 SELECT SENTENCES. What is often termed shyness, is nothing more than re fined sense and an indifference to common observations. The higher character a person supports the more he should regard his minutest actions. Deference often shrinks and withers as much upon the approach of intimacy, as the sensitive plant does upon the touch of one's finger. A liar begins by making falsehood appear Like truth, and ends with making truth itself appear like falsehood. CHAPTER VII. Deference is the most complicate, the most indirect, and the most elegant of all compliments. He that lies in bed all a summer's morning, loses the chief pleasure of the day : he that gives up his youth to indolence undergoes a loss of the same kind. Shining characters are not always the most agreeable ones. The mild radiance of an emerald is by no means less pleas ing than the glare of the ruby. Learning is like mercury, one of the most powerful and excellent things in the world in skilful hands ; in unskilful, most mischievous. A man should never be ashamed to own he has been in the wrong, which is but saying in other words, that he is wiser to-day than he was yesterday. Wherever we find a great deal of gratitude in a poor man, we may take it for granted there would be as much gene rosity if he were a rich man. It often happens that those are the best people whose cha racters have been most injured by slanderers : as we usually find that to be the sweetest fruit which the birds have been pecking at."], [21, "7 SELECT SENTENCES.

What a piece of work is man ! how noble in reason ! how infinite in faculties ! in form and moving how express and admirable ! in action how like an angel ! in apprehension how like a God! If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do, chapels had been churches and poor men's cottages princes' palaces. He is a good divine who follows his own instruc tions : I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the twenty to follow my own teaching. Men's evil manners live in brass ; their virtues we write in water.

Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well, When our deep plots do fail ; and that should teach us There's a divinity that shapes our ends, Rough-hew them how we will.

A Dervise, travelling through Tartary, being arrived at the town of Balk, went into the king's palace by mistake, as thinking it to be a public inn or caravansary. Having looked about him for some time, he entered into a long gallery, where he laid down his wallet, and spread his carpet, in order to repose himself upon it after the manner of the eastern nations. He had not been long in this posture, before he was discovered by some of the guards, who asked him what was his business in that place ? The Dervise told them he intended to take up his night's lodging in that caravansary. The guards let him know, in a very angry manner, that the house he was in was not a caravansary, but the king's palace. It happened that the king himself passed through the gal lery during this debate, and smiling at the mistake of the Dervise, asked him how he could possibly be so dull as not to distinguish a palace from a caravansary ? Sir, says the Dervise, give me leave to ask your majesty a question or two. Who were the persons that lodged in this house when it was first built 1 The king replied, His ancestors. And who, says the Dervise, was the last person that lodged here ? The king replied, His father. And who is it, says the Dervise, that lodges here at present i The king told"], [25, "NARRATIVE PIECES. 11 him, That it was he himself. And who, says the Dervise, will be here after you ? The king answered, The young prince his son. Ah, sir, said the Dervise, a house that changes its inhabitants so often, and receives such a per petual succession of guests, is not a palace, but a caravansary. Spectator. CHAPTER II. TURKISH TALE. We are told that the Sultan Mahmoud, by his perpetual wars abroad, and his tyranny at home, had filled his do minions with ruin and desolation, and half unpeopled the Persian Empire. The vizier to this great Sultan (whether an humorist or enthusiast, we are not informed) pretended to have learned of a certain Dervise to understand the lan guage of birds, so that there was not a bird that could open his mouth, but the vizier knew what it was he said. As he was one evening with the emperor, in their return from hunting, they saw a couple of owls upon a tree, that grew near an old wall out of a heap of rubbish. I would fain know, says the Sultan, what those two owls are saying to one another ; listen to their discourse, and give me an account of it. The vizier approached the tree, pretending to be very attentive to the two owls. Upon his return to the Sultan, Sir, says he, I have heard part of their con versation, but dare not tell you what it is. The Sultan would not be satisfied with such an answer, but forced him to repeat word for word everything the owls had said. You must know, then, said the vizier, that one of these owls has a son, and the other a daughter, between whom they are now upon a treaty of marriage. The father of the son said to the father of the daughter in my hearing, Brother,"], [26, "12 NARRATIVE PIECES. I consent to this marriage, provided you will settle upon your daughter fifty ruined villages for her person. To which the father of the daughter replied, instead of fifty I will give her five hundred, if you please. God grant a long life to Sultan Mahmoud; whilst he reigns over us, we shall never want ruined villages. The story says, the Sultan was so touched with the fable, that he rebuilt the towns and villages which had been de stroyed, and from that time forward consulted the good of his people. Spectator. CHAPTER III. LABOUR. Labour, the offspring of Want, and the mother of Health and Contentment, lived with her two daughters in a little cottage, by the side of a hill, at a great distance from town. They were totally unacquainted with the great, and kept no better company than the neighbouring villagers ; but having a desire of seeing the world, they forsook their companions and habitation, and determined to travel. Labour went soberly along the road with Health on the right hand, who by the sprightliness of her conversation, and songs of cheer fulness and joy, softened the toils of the way ; while Con tentment went smiling on the left, supporting the steps of her mother, and by her perpetual good-humour increasing the vivacity of her sister. In this manner they travelled over forests and through towns and villages, till at last they arrived at the capital of the kingdom. At their entrance into the great city, the mother conjured her daughters never to lose sight of her ; for it was the will of Jupiter, she said, that their separation should be attended with the utter ruin of all three. But Health was of too gay a disposition to regard the counsels of"], [27, "13 NARRATIVE PIECES.

Content ment, in the absence of her sister, gave herself up to the enticements of Sloth, and was never heard of after ; while Labour, who could have no enjoyment without her daugh ters, went everywhere in search of them, till she was at last seized by Lassitude in her way, and died in misery.

What a fool is this fellow (says a man upon the road) to be trudging it on foot with his son, that his ass may go light ! The old man hearing this, set his boy upon the ass, and went whistling by the side of him. Why, sirrah ! (cries a second man to the boy,) is it fit for you to be riding, while your poor old father is walking on foot ? The father, upon this rebuke, took down his boy from the ass, and mounted himself. Do you see (says a third) how the lazy old knave rides along upon his beast, while his poor little boy is almost crippled with walking ? The old man no sooner heard this, than he took up his son behind him. Pray, honest friend (says a fourth), is that ass your own ? Yes, says the man. One would not have thought so, re plied the other, by your loading him so unmercifully. You and your son are better able to carry the poor beast than he you. Anything to please, says the owner ; and alighting with his son, they tied the legs of the ass together, and by the help of a pole endeavoured to carry him upon their shoulders over the bridge that led to the town. This was so entertaining a sight, that the people ran in crowds to laugh at it ; till the ass, conceiving a dislike to the over complaisance of his master, burst asunder the cords that tied"], [28, "14 NARRATIVE PIECES. him, slipped from the pole, and tumbled into the river. The poor old man made the best of his way home, ashamed and vexed, that by endeavouring to please everybody, he had pleased nobody, and lost his ass into the bargain. World. CHAPTER V. HERCULES' CHOICE. When Hercules was in that part of his youth in which it was natural for him to consider what course of life he ought to pursue, he one day retired into a desert, where the silence and solitude of the place very much favoured his meditations. As he was musing on his present condition, and very much perplexed in himself on the state of life he should choose, he saw two women of a larger stature than ordinary approaching towards him. One of them had a very noble air, and graceful deportment \u2014 her beauty was natural and easy, her person clean and unspotted, her eyes cast towards the ground with an agreeable reserve, her mo tion and behaviour full of modesty, and her raiment as white as snow. The other had a great deal of health and floridness in her countenance, which she had helped with an artificial white and red ; and endeavoured to appear more graceful than ordinary in her mien, by a mixture of affectation in all her gestures. She had a wonderful con fidence and assurance in her looks, and all the variety of colours in her dress, that she thought were the most proper to show her complexion to advantage. She cast her eyes upon herself, then turned them on those that were pre sent, to see how they liked her, and often looked on the figure she made in her own shadow. Upon her nearer ap proach to Hercules, she stepped before the other lady, who came forward with a regular composed carriage, and running up to him, accosted him after the following manner :"], [29, "NARRATIVE PIECES. 15 My dear Hercules, says she, I find you are very much divided in your own thoughts upon the way of life that you ought to choose ; be my friend, and follow me ; I will lead you into the possession of pleasure, and out of the reach of pain, and remove you from all the noise and disquietude of business. The affairs of either war or peace shall have no power to disturb you. Your whole employment shall be to make your life easy, and to entertain every sense with its proper gratifications. Sumptuous tables, beds of roses, clouds of perfumes, concerts of music, crowds of beauties, are all in readiness to receive you. Come along with me into this region of delights, this world of pleasure, and bid farewell for ever to care, to pain, to business. Hercules hearing the lady talk after this manner, desired to know her name, to which she answered, My friends, and those who are well acquainted with me, call me Happiness ; but my enemies, and those who would injure my reputation, have given me the name of Pleasure. By this time the other lady was come up, who addressed herself to the young hero in a very different manner. Hercules, says she, I offer myself to you because I know you are descended from the gods, and give proofs of that descent by your love to virtue and application to the studies proper for your age. This makes me hoj)e you will gain both for yourself and me an immortal reputation. But, before I invite you into my society and friendship, I will be open and sincere with you, and must lay down this as an established truth, that there is nothing truly valuable which can be purchased without pains and labour. The gods have set a price upon every real and noble pleasure. If you would gain the favour of the deity, you must be at the pains of worship ping him; if the friendship of\" good men, you must study to oblige them ; if you would be honoured by your country, you must take care to serve it. In short, if you would be eminent in war or peace, you must become master of all the qualifi-"], [30, "16 NARRATIVE PIECES. cations that can make you so. These are the only terms and conditions upon which I can propose happiness. The Goddess of Pleasure here broke in upon her discourse : You see, said she, Hercules, by her own confession, the way to her pleasures is long and difficult, whereas that which I propose is short and easy. Alas ! said the other lady, whose visage glowed with resentment made up of scorn and pity, what are the pleasures you proposed 1 To eat before you are hungry, drink before you are athirst, sleep before you are tired ; to gratify appetites before they are raised, and raise such appe tites as nature never planted. You never heard the most delicious music, which is the praise of one's self ; nor saw the most beautiful object, which is the work of one's own hands. Your votaries pass away their youth in a dream of mistaken pleasures, while they are hoarding up anguish, torment, and remorse, for old age. As for me, I am the friend of gods and of good men, and agreeable companion to the artizan, and household guardian to the fathers of families, a patron and protector of servants, an associate in all true and generous friendships. The ban quets of my votaries are never costly, but always delicious ; for none eat or drink at them who are not invited by hunger and thirst. Their slumbers are sound and their wakings cheerful. My young men have the pleasure of hearing themselves praised by those who are in years ; and those who are in years, of being honoured by those who are young. In a word, my followers are favoured by the gods, beloved by their acquaintance, esteemed by their country, and after the close of their labours, honoured by posterity.

And this, said he, putting the remains of a crust into his wallet \u2014 and this should have been thy portion, hadst thou been alive to have shared it with me. I thought, by the accent, it had been an apostrophe to his child ; but it was to his ass, and to the very ass we had seen dead in the road, which had occasioned La Fleur's misadventure. The man seemed to lament it much ; and it instantly brought into my mind Sancho's lamentation for his ; but he did it with more true touches of nature. The mourner was sitting upon a stone bench at the door, with the ass's pannel and its bridle on one side, which he took up from time to time, then laid them down, looked at them, and shook his head. He then took his crust of bread out of his wallet again, as if to eat it ; held it some time in his hand, then laid it upon the bit of his ass's bridle \u2014 looked wistfully at the little arrangement he had made \u2014 and then gave a sigh. The simplicity of his grief drew numbers about him, and La Fleur among the rest, whilst the horses were getting ready ; as I continued sitting in the post-chaise, I could see and hear over their heads. He said he had come last from Spain, where he had been from the furthest borders of Franconia ; and had got so far on his return home, when his ass died. Every one seemed desirous to know what business could have taken so old and poor a man so far a journey from his own home. It had pleased Heaven, he said, to bless him with three sons, the finest lads in all Germany ; but having in one week lost two of them by the small-pox, and the youngest falling ill of the same distemper, he was afraid of being bereft of them all, and made a vow, if Heaven would not take him"], [32, "18 NARRATIVE PIECES. from him also, he would go in gratitude to St. Iago in Spain. When the mourner got thus far in his story, he stopped to pay nature her tribute, and wept bitterly. He said Heaven had accepted the conditions ; and that he had set out from his cottage with this poor creature, who had been a patient partner of his journey \u2014 that it had eat the same bread with him all the way, and was unto him as a friend. Everybody who stood about heard the poor fellow with concern ; La Fleur offered him money. The mourner said he did not want it \u2014 it was not the value of the ass, but the loss of him. The ass, he said, he was assured, loved him \u2014 and upon this told them a long story of a mischance upon their passage over the Pyrenean mountains, which had sepa rated them from each other three days ; during which time the ass had sought him as much as he had sought the ass, and that he had neither scarce eat or drank till they met. Thou hast one comfort, friend, said I, at least, in the loss of thy poor beast ; I am sure thou hast been a merciful master to him. Alas ! said the mourner, I thought so when he was alive, but now he is dead I think otherwise ; I fear the weight of myself and my afflictions together have been too much for him, they have shortened the poor creature's days, and I fear I have them to answer for. Shame on the world, said I to myself ; did we love each other as this poor soul but loved his ass, 'twould be something. Sterne."], [33, "19 NARRATIVE PIECES. CHAPTER VII. MARIA. First Part. Thet were the sweetest notes I ever heard ; and I instantly let down the fore glass to hear them more distinctly. 'Tis Maria, said the postilion, observing I was listening. Poor Maria, continued he (leaning his body on one side to let me see her, for he was in a line between us), is sitting upon a bank playing her vespers upon her pipe, with her little goat beside her. The young fellow uttered this with an accent and a look so perfectly in tune to a feeling heart, that I instantly made a vow I would give him a four-and-twenty sous piece when I got to Moulines. And who is poor Maria ? said I. The love and pity of all the villages around us, said the postilion. It is but three years ago, that the sun did not shine upon so fair, so quick-witted aud amiable a maid ; and better fate did Maria deserve, than to have her banns forbid, by the intrigues of the curate of the parish who published them He was going on, when Maria, who had made a short pause, put the pipe to her mouth, and began the air again. They were the same notes ; yet were ten times sweeter. It is the evening service to the Virgin, said the young man ; but who has taught her to play it, or how she came by her pipe, no one knows ; we think that Heaven has assisted her in both ; for ever since she has been unsettled in her mind, it seems her only consolation \u2014 she has never once had the pipe out of her hand, but plays that service upon it almost night and day. The postilion delivered this with so much discretion and"], [34, "20 NARRATIVE PIECES. natural eloquence, that I could not help deciphering some thing in his face above his condition, and should have sifted out his history, had not poor Maria taken such full posses sion of me. We had got up by this time almost to the bank where Maria was sitting ; she was in a thin white jacket, with her hair, all but two tresses, drawn up in a silk net, with a few olive leaves twisted a little fantastically on one side. She was beautiful ; and if ever I felt the full force of an honest heart-ache, it was the moment I saw her. God help her ! poor damsel ! above a hundred masses, said the postilion, have been said in the several parish churches and convents around for her, but without effect ; we have still hopes, as she is sensible for short intervals, that the Virgin at last will restore her to herself ; but her parents, who know her best, are hopeless upon that score, and think her senses are lost for ever. As the postilion spoke this, Maria made a cadence so melancholy, so tender and querulous, that I sprang out of the chaise to help her, and found myself sitting betwixt her and her goat before I relapsed from my enthusiasm. Maria looked wistfully for some time at me, and then at her goat, and then at me, and then at her goat again, and so on alternately. Well, Maria, said I softly, what resemblance do you find ? I do entreat the candid reader to believe me, that it was from the humblest conviction of what a beast man is, that I asked the question ; and that I would not have let fallen an unseasonable pleasantry in the venerable presence of misery, to be entitled to all the wit that ever Rabelais scattered. Adieu, Maria ! \u2014 adieu, poor hapless damsel ! \u2014 some time, but not now, I may hear thy sorrows from thy own lips : \u2022but I was deceived ; for that moment she took her pipe, and told me such a tale of woe with it, that I rose up, and with broken and irregular steps walked softly to my chaise."], [35, "21 NARRATIVE PIECES. Second Part. When we had got within half a league of Moulines, at a little opening in the road leading to a thicket, I discovered poor Maria sitting under a poplar, \u2014 she was sitting with her elbow in her lap, and her head leaning on one side within her hand ; a small brook ran at the foot of the tree. I bade the postilion go on with the chaise to Moulines, and La Fleur to bespeak my supper, and that I would walk after him. She was dressed in white, and much as my friend described her, except that her hair hung loose, which before was twisted within a silk net. She had superadded likewise to her jacket a pale green riband, which fell across her shoulder to the waist, at the end of which hung her pipe. Her goat had been as faithless as her lover ; and she had got a little dog in lieu of him, which she had kept tied by a string to her girdle. As I looked at her dog, she drew him towards her with the string. Thou shalt not leave me, Sylvio, said she. I looked in Maria's eyes, and saw she was thinking more of her father than of her lover or her little goat, for as she uttered them the tears trickled down her cheeks. I sat down close by her, and Maria let me wipe them away as they fell, with my handkerchief. I then steeped it in my own, and then in hers, and then in mine \u2014 and then I wiped hers again ; and as I did it, I felt such indescribable emotions within me, as I am sure could not be accounted for from any combinations of matter and motion. I am positive I have a soul ; nor can all the books with which materialists have pestered the world ever convince me of the contrary. When Maria had come a little to herself, I asked her if she remembered a pale thin person of a man who had sat down betwixt her and her goat about two years before ? She said, she was unsettled much at that time, but remembered it upon"], [36, "22 NARRATIVE PIECES. two accounts, that, ill as we was, she saw the person pitied her ; and next, that her goat had stolen his handkerchief, and she had beat him for the theft; she had washed it, she saicb in the brook, and kept it ever since in her pocket, to restore it to him, in case she should ever see him again ; which, she added, he had half promised her. As she told me this, she took the handkerchief out of her pocket to let me see it. She had folded it up neatly in a couple of vine-leaves, tied round with a tendril ; on opening it I saw an S marked in one of the corners. She had since that, she told me, strayed as far as Rome and walked round St. Peter's once, and returned back ; that she found her way alone across the Apennines, had travelled over all Lombardy without money, and through the flinty roads of Savoy without shoes : how she had borne it, and how she had got supported, she could not tell ; but God tempers the wind, said Maria, to the shorn lamb. Shorn, indeed ! and to the quick, said I ; and wast thou in my own land, where I have a cottage, I would take thee to it and shelter thee ; thou shouldst eat of my own bread, and drink of my own cup. I would be kind to thy Sylvio ; in all thy weakness and wanderings I would seek after thee. and bring thee back ; when the sun went down I would say my prayers, and when I had done thou shouldst play thy evening song upon thy pipe, nor would the incense of my sacrifice be worse accepted for entering heaven along with that of a broken heart. Nature melted within me as I uttered this ; and Maria observing, as I took out my handkerchief, that it was steeped too much already to be of use, would needs go wash it in the stream. And where will you dry it, Maria 1 said I. I will dry it in my bosom, said she ; it will do me good. And is your heart still so warm, Maria 1 said I. I touched upon the string on which hung all her sorrows. She looked with wistful disorder some time in my face ; and"], [37, "23 NARRATIVE PIECES. then, without saying anything, took her pipe, and played her service to the Virgin. The string I had touched ceased to vibrate ; in a moment or two Maria returned to herself, let her pipe fall, and rose up. And where are you going, Maria 1 said I. She said, to Moulines. Let us go, said I, together. Maria put her arm within mine, and lengthening the string to let the dog fol low ; in that order we entered Moulines. Though I hate salutations and greetings in the market place, yet when we got into the middle of this, I stopped to take my last look and last farewell of Maria. Maria, though not tall, was nevertheless of the first order of fine forms ; affliction had touched her looks with some thing that was scarce earthly, still she was feminine, \u2014 and\" so much was there about her of all that the heart wishes, or the eye looks for in woman, that could the traces be ever worn out of her brain, and those of Eliza's out of mine, she should not only eat of my bread and drink of my own cup, but Maria should he on my bosom, and be unto me as a daughter. Adieu, poor luckless maiden ! imbibe the oil and wine which the compassion of a stranger, as he journieth on his way, now pours into thy wounds \u2014 the Being who has twice bruised thee can only bind them up for ever.

Oft it has been my lot to mark A proud, conceited, talking spark, With eyes that hardly served at most To guard their master 'gainst a post : Yet round the world the blade has been To see whatever could be seen."], [38, "24 NARRATIVE PIECES. Returning from his finish'd tour, Grown ten times perter than before, Whatever word you chance to drop, The travell'd fool your mouth will stop ; \" Sir, if my judgment you'll allow \u2014 I've seen \u2014 and sure I ought to know \" \u2014 So begs you'd pay a due submission, And acquiesce in his decision. Two travellers of such a cast, As o'er Arabia's wilds they past, And on their way in friendly chat Now talk'd of this, and then of that, Discoursed awhile, 'mongst other matter, Of the Cameleon's form and nature. \" A stranger animal,\" cries one, \" Sure never lived beneath the sun : A lizard's body lean and long, A fish's head, a serpent's tongue, Its tooth with triple claw disjoin'd ; And what a length of tail behind !

'twas white. Both stared, the man look'd wondrous wise. \" My children,\" the Cameleon cries, \u2014 - (Then first the creature found a tongue) \" You all are right, and all are wrong : When next you talk of what you view, Think others see as well as you, Nor wonder if you find that none Prefers your eyesight to his own.\" Merrick. c"], [40, "26 NARRATIVE PIECES.

Where London's column, pointing to the skies, Like a tall bully, lifts the head, and lies, There dwelt a citizen of sober fame, A plain good man, and Balaam was his name ; Religious, punctual, frugal, and so forth ; His word would pass for more than he was worth. One solid dish his week-day meal affords, An added pudding solemnized the Lord's : Constant at church, and 'Change ; his gains were sure, His givings rare, save farthings to the poor.

Roused by the Prince of Air, the whirlwinds sweep The surge, and plunge his father in the deep ; Then full against his Cornish lands they roar, And two rich shipwrecks bless the lucky shore. Sir Balaam now, he lives like other folks, He takes his chirping pint, and cracks his jokes : \" Live like yourself,\" was soon my Lady's word ; And lo ! two puddings smoked upon the board. Asleep and naked as an Indian lay, An honest factor stole a gem away ; He pledged it to the knight ; the knight had wit, So kept the diamond, and the rogue was bit. Some scruple rose, but thus he eased his thought, \" I'll now give sixpence where I gave a groat ; Where once I went to church, I'll now go twice \u2014 And am so clear, too, of all other vice.\" The Tempter saw his time ; the work he plied ; Stocks and subscriptions pour on every side, Till all the Demon makes his full descent In one abundant shower of cent, per cent. Sinks deep within him, and possesses whole, Then dubs director, aud secures his soul. Behold Sir Balaam now a man of spirit, Ascribes his gettings to his parts and merit : What late he call'd a blessing, now was wit, And God's good Providence a lucky hit. Things change their titles, as our manners turn : His counting-house employ'd the Sunday morn ; Seldom at church ('twas such a busy life), But duly sent his family and wife.

EDWIN AND EMMA. Far in the windings of a vale, Fast by a sheltering wood, The safe retreat of health and peace, An humble cottage stood.

ON modesty. I know no two words that have been more abused by the different and wrong interpretations which are put upon them than these two, Modesty and Assurance. To say, such a one is a modest man, sometimes indeed passes for a good character ; but at present is very often used to signify a sheepish, awkward fellow, who has neither good breeding, politeness, nor any knowledge of the world. Again, a man of assurance, though at first it only denoted a person of a free and open carriage, is now very usually applied to a profligate wretch, who can break through all the rules of decency and morality without a blush. I shall endeavour, therefore, in this essay to restore these words to their true meaning, to prevent the idea of Modesty from being confounded with that of Sheepishness, and to hinder Impudence from passing for Assurance. If I was put to define modesty, I would call it, the reflec tion of an ingenuous mind, either when a man has com mitted an action for which he censures himself, or fancies that he is exposed to the censure of others. For this reason, a man truly modest is as much so when he is alone as in company, and as subject to a blush in his closet as when the eyes of multitudes are upon him."], [55, "41 DIDACTIC PIECES. I do not remember to have met with any instance of modesty with which I am so well pleased as that celebrated one of the young prince, whose father, being a tributary king to the Romans, had several complaints laid against him before the senate, as a tyrant and oppressor of his subjects. The prince went to Rome to defend his father, but coming into the senate and hearing a multitude of crimes proved upon him, was so oppressed when it came to his turn to speak, that he was unable to utter a word. The story tells us, that the fathers were more moved at this instance of modesty and ingenuity than they could have been by the most pathetic oration; and, in short, pardoned the guilty father for this early promise of virtue in the son. I take Assurance to be, the faculty of possessing a man's self, or of saying and doing indifferent things without any uneasiness or emotion in the mind. That which generally gives a man assurance, is a moderate knowledge of the world, but above all, a mind fixed and determined in itself to do nothing against the rules of honour and decency. An open and assured behaviour is the natural consequence of such a resolution. A man thus armed, if his words or actions are at any time misinterpreted, retires within him self, and from a consciousness of his own integrity, assumes force enough to despise the little censures of ignorance or malice. Every one ought to cherish and encourage in himself the modesty and assurance I have here mentioned. A man without assurance is liable to be made uneasy by the folly or ill-nature of every one he converses with. A man without modesty is lost to all sense of honour and virtue. It is more than probable, that the prince above mentioned possessed both these qualifications in a very eminent degree. Without assurance he would never have undertaken to speak before the most august assembly in the world ; without mo-"], [56, "42 DIDACTIC PIECES. desty he would have pleaded the cause he had taken upon him, though it had appeared ever so scandalous. From what has been said, it is plain that modesty and assurance are both amiable, and may very well meet in the same person. When they are thus mixed and blended to gether, they compose what we endeavour to express when we say a modest assurance ; by which we understand the just mean between bashfulness and impudence. I shall conclude with observing, that as the same man may be both modest and assured, so it is also possible for the same person to be both impudent and bashful. We have frequent instances of this odd kind of mixture in people of depraved minds and mean education ; who, though they are not able to meet a man's eyes, or pronounce a sen tence without confusion, can voluntarily commit the greatest villanies, or most indecent actions. Such a person seems to have made a resolution to do ill even in spite of himself, and in defiance of all those checks and restraints his temper and complexion seem to have laid in his way. Upon the whole, I would endeavour to establish this maxim, that the practice of virtue is the most proper method to give a man a becoming assurance in his words and actions. Guilt always seeks to shelter itself in one of the extremes, and is sometimes attended with both. Spectator. CHAPTER II. ON CHEERFULNESS. I have always preferred Cheerfulness to Mirth. The latter I consider as an act, the former as a habit of the mind. Mirth is short and transient, cheerfulness fixed and perma nent. Those are often raised into the greatest transports"], [57, "43 DIDACTIC PIECES. of mirth who are subject to the greatest depressions of melancholy : on the contrary, cheerfulness, though it does not give the mind such an exquisite gladness, prevents us from falling into any depth of sorrow. Mirth is like a flash of lightning, that breaks through a gloom of clouds, and glitters for a moment ; cheerfulness keeps up a kind of day light in the mind, and fills it with a steady and perpetual serenity. Men of austere principles look upon mirth as too wanton and dissolute for a state of probation, and as filled with a certain triumph and insolence of heart that is inconsistent with a life which is every moment obnoxious to the greatest dangers. Writers of this complexion have observed, that the sacred Person, who was the great pattern of perfection, was never seen to laugh. Cheerfulness of mind is not liable to any of these excep- tions ; it is of a serious and composed nature ; it does not throw the mind into a condition improper for the present state of humanity, and is very conspicuous in the characters of those who are looked upon as the greatest philosophers among the Heathens, as well as among those who have been -deservedly esteemed as saints and holy men among Chris- tians. If we consider cheerfulness in three lights, \u2014 with regard to ourselves, to those we converse with, and to the great Author of our being, \u2014 it will not a little recommend itself on each of these accounts. The man who is possessed of this excellent frame of mind is not only easy in his thoughts, but a perfect master of all the powers and faculties of his soul : his imagination is always clear and his judgment un disturbed : his temper is even and unruffled, whether in action or in solitude. He comes with a relish to all those goods which nature has provided for him, tastes all the pleasures of the creation which are poured upon him, and"], [58, "44 DIDACTIC PIECES. does not feel the full weight of those accidental evils which may befall him. If we consider him in relation to the persons whom he converses with, it naturally produces love and good-will towards him. A cheerful mind is not only disposed to be affable and obliging, but raises the same good humour in those who come within its influence. A man finds himself pleased, he does not know why, with the cheerfulness of his companion : it is like a sudden sunshine that awakens a sacred delight in the mind, without her attending to it. The heart rejoices of its own accord, and naturally flows out into friendship and benevolence towards the person who has so kindly an effect upon it. When I consider this cheerful state of mind in its third relation, I cannot but look upon it as a constant habitual gratitude to the Author of nature. An inward cheerfulness is an implicit praise and thanksgiving to Providence under all its dispensations. It is a kind of acquiescence in the state wherein we are placed, and a secret approbation of the Divine will in his conduct towards man. A man, who uses his best endeavours to live according to the dictates of virtue and right reason, has two perpetual sources of cheerfulness, \u2014 in the consideration of his own na ture, and of that Being on whom he has a dependence. If he looks into himself, he cannot but rejoice in that existence, which is so lately bestowed upon him, and which, after mil lions of ages, will be stdl new, and still in its beginning. How many self-congratulations naturally rise in the mind, when it reflects on this its entrance into eternity ; when it takes a view of those improveable faculties, which in a few years, and even at its first setting out, have made so con siderable a progress, and which will be still receiving an in crease of perfection, and consequently an increase of happi ness ! The consciousness of such a being spreads a perpetual"], [59, "DIDACTIC PIECES. 45 diffusion of joy through the soul of a virtuous man, and makes him look upon himself every moment as more happy than he knows how to conceive. The second source of cheerfulness to a good mind is its consideration of that Being on whom we have our depend ence, and in whom, though .we behold Him as yet but in the first faint discoveries of his perfections, we see everything that we can imagine as great, glorious, or amiable. We find ourselves everywhere upheld by his goodness, and surrounded with an immensity of love and mercy. In short, we depend upon a Being whose power qualifies Him to make us happy by an infinity of means, whose goodness and truth engage Him to make those happy who desire it of Him, and whose unchaugeableness will secure us in this happiness to all eternity. Such considerations, which every one should perpetually cherish in his thoughts, will banish from us all that secret heaviness of heart which unthinking men are subject to when they lie under no real affliction ; all that anguish which we may feel from any evil that actually oppresses us ; to which I may likewise add those little cracklings of mirth and folly that are apter to betray virtue than support it, and establish in us such an even and cheerful temper as makes us pleasing to ourselves, to those with whom we converse, and to Him whom we were made to please. Spectator. CHAPTER III. ON HONOUR. Every principle that is a motive to good actions ought to be encouraged, since men are of so different a make that the same principle does not work equally upon all minds. What some men are prompted to by conscience, duty, or religion,"], [60, "46 didactic pieces. which are oidy different names for the same thing, others are prompted to by honour. The sense of honour is of so fine and delicate a nature, that it is only to be met with in minds which are naturally noble, or in such as have been cultivated by great examples, or a refined education. This essay, therefore, is chiefly de signed for those who, by means of any of these advantages, are, or ought to be, actuated by this glorious principle. But as nothing is more pernicious than a principle of action when it is misunderstood, I shall consider honour with respect to three sorts of men. First of all, with regard to those who have a right notion of it. Secondly, with regard to those who have a mistaken notion of it. And, thirdly, with regard to those who treat it as chimerical, and turn it into ridicule. In the first place, true honour, though it be a different principle from religion, is that which produces the same effects. The lines of action, though drawn from different parts, terminate in the same point. Religion embraces virtue, as it is enjoined by the laws of God ; honour, as it is graceful and ornamental to human nature. The religious man fears, the man of honour scorns, to do an ill actiou. The latter considers vice as something that is beneath him, the other, as something that is offensive to the Divine Being. The one, as what is unbecoming, the other, as what is for bidden. Thus Seneca speaks iu the natural and genuine language of a man of honour when he declares, that were there no God to see or punish vice, he would not commit it, because it is of so mean, so base, and so vile a nature. I shall conclude this head with the description of honour in the parting of young Juba. Honour's a sacred tie, the law of kings, The noble mind's distinguishing perfection,"], [61, "47 didactic pieces. That aids and strengthens virtue when it meets her, And imitates her actions where she is not. It ought not to be sported with. Cato. In the second place, we are to consider those who have mistaken notions of honour. And these are such as esta blish anything to themselves for a point of honour which is contrary either to the laws of God, or of their country ; who think it more honourable to revenge than to forgive an injury ; who make no scruple of telling a lie, but would put any man to death that accuses them of it ; who are more careful to guard their reputation by their courage than by their virtue. True fortitude is, indeed, so becoming in human nature, that he who wants it scarce deserves the name of a man ; but we find several who so much abuse this notion, that they place the whole idea of honour in a kind of brutal courage, by which means we have had many among us who have called themselves men of honour, that would have been a disgrace to a gibbet. In a word, the man who sacrifices any duty of a reasonable creature to a pre vailing mode or fashion, who looks upon anything as honour able that is displeasing to his Maker, or destructive to society, who thinks himself obliged by this principle to the practice of some virtues and not of others, is by no means to be reckoned among true men of honour. Timogenes was a lively instance of one actuated by false honour. Timogenes would smile at a man's jest who ridi culed his Maker, and at the same time run a man through the body that spoke ill of his friend. Timogenes would have scorned to have betrayed a secret that was intrusted with him, though the fate of his country depended upon the dis covery of it. Timogenes took away the life of a young fellow in a duel for having spoken dl of Belinda, a lady whom he himself had seduced in her youth, and betrayed hito want and ignominy. To close his character, Timogenes,"], [62, "48 DIDACTIC PIECES. after having ruined several poor tradesmen's families who had trusted him, sold his estate to satisfy his creditors, but, like a man of honour, disposed of all the money he could make of it in the paying of his play-debts, or, to speak in his own language, his \" debts of honour.\" In the third place, we are to consider those persons who treat this principle as chimerical, and turn it into ridicule. Men who are professedly of no honour, are of a more profli- gate and abandoned nature than even those who are actuated by false notions of it, as there is more hope of a heretic than of an atheist. These sons of infamy consider honour, with old Syphax, in the play before-mentioned, as a fine imaginary notion, that leads astray young, unexperienced men, and draws them into real mischiefs while they are engaged in the pursuits of a shadow. These are generally persons who, in Shakespeare's phrase, \" are worn and hack- neyed in the ways of men ; \" whose imaginations are grown callous, and have lost all those delicate sentiments which are natural to minds that are innocent and undepraved. Such old battered miscreants ridicule everything as romantic that comes in competition with their present interest, and treat those persons as visionaries who dare stand up in a corrupt age for what has not its immediate reward joined to it. The talents, interests, or experience of such men, make them very often useful in all parties, and at all times. But what- ever wealth and dignities they may arrive at, they ought to consider that every one stands as a blot in the annals of his country who arrives at the temple of honour by any other way than through that of virtue. Guardian."], [63, "49 DIDACTIC PIECES. CHAPTER IV. ON THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLD. Nothing has so much exposed men of learning to contempt and ridicule, as their ignorance of things which are known to all but themselves. Those who have been taught to con sider the institutions of the schools as giving the last per fection to human abilities, are surprised to see men wrinkled with study, yet wanting to be instructed in the minute cir cumstances of propriety, or the necessary forms of daily transaction ; and quickly shake off their reverence for modes of education, which they find to produce no ability above the rest of mankind. Books, says Bacon, can never teach the use of books. The student must learn by commerce with mankind to re duce his speculations to practice, and accommodate his know ledge to the purposes of life. It is too common for those who have been bred to scholas tic professions, and passed much of their time in academies, where nothing but learning confers honours, to disregard every other qualification, and to imagine that they shall find mankind ready to pay homage to their knowledge, and to crowd about them for instruction. They therefore step out from their cells into the open world, with all the confidence of authority and dignity of importance ; they look round about them at once with ignorance and scorn, on a race of beings to whom they are equally unknown and equally con temptible, but whose manners they must imitate, and with whose opinions they must comply, if they desire to pass their time happily among them. To lessen that disdain with which scholars are inclined to look on the common business of the world, and the unwil lingness with which they condescend to learn what is not to be found in any system of philosophy, it may be necessary D"], [64, "50 DIDACTIC PIECES. to consider, that though admiration is excited by abstruse researches and remote discoveries, yet pleasure is not given, nor affection conciliated, but by softer accomplishments, and qualities more easily communicable to those about us. He that can only converse upon questions, about which only a small part of mankind has knowledge sufficient to make them curious, must lose his days in unsocial silence, and live in the crowd of life without a companion. He that can only be useful in great occasions, may die without exerting his abilities, and stand a helpless spectator of a thousand vexations which fret away happiness, and which nothing is required to remove but a little dexterity of conduct and readiness of expedients. No degree of knowledge attainable by man is able to set him above the want of hourly assistance, or to extinguish the desire of fond endearments, and tender officiousness ; and therefore no one should think it unnecessary to learn those arts by which friendship may be gained. Kindness is preserved by a constant reciprocation of benefits or inter change of pleasures ; but such benefits only can be bestowed, as others are capable of receiving, and such pleasures only imparted, as others are qualified to enjoy. By this descent from the pinnacles of art, no honour will be lost ; for the condescensions of learning are always over paid by gratitude. An elevated genius employed iu little things appears, to use the simile of Longinus, like the sun in his evening declination ; he remits his splendour, but retains his magnitude ; and pleases more though he dazzles less. Ra mbler."], [65, "51 DIDACTIC PIECES. CHAPTER V. ON THE ADVANTAGES OF UNITING GENTLENESS OF MANNERS WITH FIRMNESS OF MIND. I mentioned to you, some time ago, a sentence which I would most earnestly wish you always to retain in your thoughts, and observe in your conduct ; it is suaviter in modo, fortiter in re. I do not know any one rule so unex ceptionably useful and necessary in every part of life. The suaviter in modo alone, would degenerate and sink into a mean, timid complaisance and passiveness, if not sup ported and dignified by the fortiter in re, which would also run into impetuosity and brutality if not tempered and soft ened by the suaviter in modo ; however, they are seldom united. The warm choleric man, with strong animal spirits, despises the suaviter in modo, and thinks to carry all before him by the fortiter in re. He may possibly, by great acci dent, now and then succeed, when he has only weak and timid people to deal with ; but his general fate will be to shock, offend, be hated, and fail. On the other hand, the cunning, crafty man thinks to gain all his ends by the suaviter in modo only : he becomes all things to all men ; he seems to have no opinion of his own, and servilely adopts the present opinion of the present per son ; he insinuates himself only into the esteem of fools, but is soon detected, and surely despised by everybody else. The wise man (who differs as much from the cunning, as from the choleric, man) alone joins the suaviter in modo with the fortiter in re. If you are in authority, and have a right to command, your commands, delivered suaviter in modo, will be willingly, cheerfully, and, consequently, well obeyed ; whereas, if given only fortiter, that is, brutally, they will rather, as Tacitus says, be interpreted than executed. For my own part, if I d 2"], [66, "52 DIDACTIC PIECES. bade my footman bring me a glass of wine in a rough, in sulting manner, I should expect that, in obeying me, he would contrive to spill some of it upon me, and I am sure I should deserve it. A cool, steady resolution should show that, where you have a right to command, you will be obeyed ; but, at the same time, a gentleness in the manner of enforcing that obedience should make it a cheerful one, and soften, as much as possible, the mortifying consciousness of inferiority. If you are to ask a favour, or even to solicit your due, you must do it suaviter in modo, or you will give those who have a mind to refuse you either, a pretence to do it, by resenting the manner ; but, on the other hand, you must, by a steady perseverance, and decent tenaciousness, show the fortiter in re. In short, this precept is the only way I know in the world of being loved without being despised, and feared without being hated. It constitutes the dignity of character, which every wise man must endeavour to establish. If, therefore, you find that you have a hastiness in your temper, which unguardedly breaks out iuto indiscreet sallies or rough expressions, to either your superiors, your equals, or your inferiors, watch it narrowly, check it carefully, and call the suaviter in modo to your assistance ; at the first impulse of passion be silent till you can be soft. Labour even to get the command of your countenance so well, that those emotions may not be read in it ; a most unspeakable advantage in business. On the other hand, let no complai sance, no gentleness of temper, no weak desire of pleasing on your part, no wheedling, coaxing nor flattery on other people's, make you recede one jot from any point that reason and prudence have bid you pursue, but_ return to the charge, persist, persevere, and you will find most things attainable that are possible. A yielding, timid meekness is always abused and insulted by the unjust and the unfeeling ; but meekness, when sustained by the fortiter in re, is always"], [67, "DIDACTIC PIECES. 53 respected, commonly successful. In your friendships and connections, as well as in your enmities, this rule is particu larly useful ; let your firmness and vigour preserve and invite attachments to you ; but, at the same time, let your manner hinder the enemies of your friends and dependents from becoming yours : let your enemies be disarmed by the gentleness of your manner, but let them feel at the same time the steadiness of your just resentment ; for there is a great difference between bearing malice, which is always un generous, and a resolute self-defence, which is always prudent and justifiable. I conclude with this observation, That gentleness of man ners with firmness of mind, is a short, but full, description of human perfection on this side of religious and moral duties.

CHAPTER VII. THE PYRAMIDS. Almost every successive traveller who has visited the Pyra mids, appears to have thought it necessary to demolish, in part at least, the conjectures of his predecessor, and to esta blish a theory of his own. The dark industry of antiquity, led by imaginary analogies of names, or by uncertain tradi tion, has in vain attempted to pierce into the obscurity which surrounds their origin ; and the researches of modern learn ing, after a much longer course of observation, may be said rather to multiply the difficulties than to assist in removing them. The whole design of their erection was, perhaps, never generally known ; but revealed only to a few chosen minis ters, whose assistance was indispensable, in conducting the mysterious mechanism of those rites, to which they were ostensibly subservient ; so that the inscription, which, ac cording to Plutarch, was engraved on the base of Minerva's or Isis' statue at Sais, importing that no mortal had hitherto withdrawn her veil \u2014 TON EMON TlEnAON OYAEIS rm 0 \\THTO\u00a3 AnEKAATYEN * \u2014 is so far from being an idle or extravagant boast, that the recesses of her sanctuary con tinue still inscrutable. That these edifices were constructed for some purposes connected with the popular worship, there can be little doubt ; that they were applied also as cemeteries for the iUustrious dead is by no means improbable ; but that the largest of the three was ever intended solely as a monument to a deceased individual is a supposition which will scarcely be admitted by any one who has attentively examined the * Plutarch, de lside and Osiride."], [71, "57 DIDACTIC PIECES. interior, with all its tortuous passages and inexplicable wind ings. The extravagant tales which the Egyptian priests re hearsed to Herodotus were probably adapted to the ap parent credulity with which he listened to their narratives ; his accounts, therefore, except where supported by the evi dence of facts, are surely not entitled to an implicit asseut. We are informed by this historian that Cheops devoted twenty years of his reign in constructing the principal pyra mid, and that one hundred thousand men were daily em ployed in the labour ! To say nothing of the cost that such an army of work men must bring on the Egyptian treasury, for au object which it is not pretended by that author was designed for any national benefit, the end appears totally inadequate to the means. If we deduct one day from every week as sacred to religious purposes, and for the sake of round numbers, multiply 100,000 by 300, we shall have an amount of thirty millions of days' labour in each year, and consequently six hundred millions of days in twenty years. From the great accumulation of sand, it is quite impos sible at present to find a horizontal base ; but we may assume the space occupied by the largest pile to be coin cident with the square in Lincoln's Inn Fields. If we sup pose a great proportion of that area to serve as a foundation for a rock several hundred feet in height and of correspond ing breadth, would it require anything like the time and labour, gravely reported by Herodotus, to produce a quad rilateral structure incasing this mount, and gradually dimi nishing to a point, whose loftiest elevation was two hundred yards 1 There are many reasons for believing that the entire mass is not artificial ; and possibly the irregular course of the different avenues was less the effect of design than a necessary compliance with the direction of the strata. The venerable historian has collected several circumstances d 3"], [72, "58 DIDACTIC PIECES. to give consistency to his narrative, and mentions an inscrip tion he saw on the great Pyramid, declaring, in Egyptian characters, how much was expended in onions, radishes, and garlic, for the labourers : the sum amounted to one thousand six hundred talents of silver. The writing was interpreted by the priests, \u2014 who, when they drew on their invention for a good current fiction, knew, doubtless, how to forge indorsements as well as the bill. But do they not, in this instance, appear to injure their credit by offering too much security ? The purpose to which these structures were applied seems equally to have eluded the researches of antiquity. Pliny is of opinion that they were either monuments erected to gra tify the vanity of successive sovereigns, or that they were an expedient to give employment and support to a redundant population. This is, surely, a very unsatisfactory solution ; the great labour observed in arranging the interior, and the cautious mechanism displayed in the distribution of the several passages, sufficiently indicate that some mysterious solemnity was connected with their formation. Many plausible reasons have undoubtedly been assigned for the supposition, that the Pyramids were, in part at least, intended for sepulchres ; and Volney has pursued the Greek word, w^afAc, with much ingenuity, through all its etymo logical gradations, till he finds it identified with the oriental compound, bour-amit, \u2014 a cave of the dead ! A modern traveller of distinguished reputation has re newed a conjecture that the great pyramid was intended as a mausoleum for the Patriarch Joseph. But, not to mention other reasons which militate against such idea, would the author of the Pentateuch, who has described with such mi nuteness the extraordinary events in the life of Pharaoh's minister, have omitted so material a circumstance connected with the honours bestowed on him at his decease 1 Indeed, the total silence of the Scriptures, on the subject of the"], [73, "59 DIDACTIC PIECES. Pyramids, appears conclusive as to their date being subse quent to the aye of Moses. Is it conceivable that those vast efforts of human labour, which have been the wonder of all succeeding ages, could remain entirely disregarded by a per son so eminently qualified to appreciate their structure, and who, from the circumstances of his education, would have enjoyed peculiar opportunities of examining their con trivance ? A variety of motives were probably combined in their ele vation, and possibly they may not have been without some astronomical object ; but their pointed summits preclude the idea that they were ever intended as observatories ; neither is the situation particularly adapted for such purpose. It has been remarked that as the Sun enters the equinoc tial signs, his disc appears as if placed ou the apex, to a spectator who reclines in an attitude of adoration at the portal. Unless such appearance is accidental, is not this an additional reason for concluding that those enormous masses were reared for some far nobler purpose than to perpetuate the memory of a deceased monarch ? May we not rather infer that they were dedicated to the mysterious worship of an Almighty architect, and that the Deity, who was typified by the outward form of the pile, had solemn rites consecrated to his worship within? \u2014 Letters from Egypt.

Every species of information, whether derived from books or the minuter accuracy of verbal narrative, is insufficient to convey to a native of Europe any adequate idea of a country which has been constituted on principles essentially different from European usages. The mind having no comparative"], [74, "60 DIDACTIC PIECES. standard to refer to on a subject so totally new, is at a loss how to frame its conceptions ; and it almost invariably hap pens that the reality has a very faint correspondence with the image prefigured. This observation applies with peculiar force to the traveller who visits the Holy Land. His arrival on the coast of Syria introduces him to objects that have no resemblance to those with which he has been hitherto asso ciated. The vegetable kingdom \u2014 the brute creation \u2014 and even his own species, \u2014 are in appearance greatly dissimilar, and seem to point out that he is alighted on a new and dis tant planet. The first sensations, therefore, which overpower the visitor of Palestine, are those of lassitude and dejection * but as he progressively advances in those sacred precincts, and per ceives an interminable plain spread out on all sides, such sensations are gradually succeeded by feelings more exalted : a mixed emotion of surprise and awe takes possession of his faculties, which \u2014 far from depressing the spirit \u2014 braces the mind and elevates the heart. The stupendous scenes that are everywhere unfolded, announce to the spectator that he surveys those regions which were once the chosen theatre of wonders ! The burning climate \u2014 the impetuous eagle \u2014 the blighted fig-tree \u2014 all the poetry, all the painting of the sa cred writings, are present to his view. Each venerable name reminds him of some mysterious agent ; every valley seems to proclaim the warnings of futurity, every mountain to re echo the hallowed accents of inspiration ! The dread voice of the Eternal himself has sounded on those shores ! To tread the ground once trodden by the mightiest of mankind, and to read the history of nations in the muti lated fragments of those monuments which were consecrated to their glory, has been often, and with justice, stated as a source of the sublimest pleasure ; but if considerations merely human can create these sensations, \u2014 if the philoso pher and historian feels himself overpowered by the weight"], [75, "61 DIDACTIC PIECES. of his reflexions, as his eye glances on the spot \" where Romulus stood \u2014 where Cicero spoke \u2014 and where C\u00e6sar fell \" \u2014 with what increased emotions of awe and veneration will the Christian moralist contemplate \" Those holy fields, Over whose acres walked those blessed feet Which \u2014 eighteen hundred years ago \u2014 were nail'd For our advantage to the bitter cross ! \" * Oppressed with the varied movements which throng and agitate his bosom, he will yield for a while to the heart's im pulse, and, seeking Religion in her own peculiar sanctuary, bow down before her altars in chastened, fervent adoration ! \u2014 Letters from Palestine. T. R. Joliffe. CHAPTER IX. ON STUDY. Studies serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability. The chief use for delight is in privateness and retiring ; for orna ment, is in discourse * and for ability, is in the judgment and disposition of business. For expert men can execute, and perhaps judge of particulars one by one * but the general counsels, and the plots, and marshalling of affairs come best from those that are learned. To spend too much time in studies is sloth \u2022 to use them too much for ornament is affectation ; to make judgment wholly by their rules is the humour of a scholar. They perfect nature and are perfected by experience : for natural abilities are like natural plants, that need pruning by duty, and studies themselves do give forth directions too much at large, except they be bounded in by experience. Crafty men contemn studies, simple men * Shakespeare \u2014 Henry IV."], [76, "62 didactic pieces. admire them, and wise men use them ; for they teach not their own use, but that is a wisdom without them, and above them, won by observation. Read not to contradict and con fute, nor to believe and take for granted, nor to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and consider. Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested \u2014 that is, some books are to be read only in parts ; others to be read, but not curiously * and some few to be read wholly, and with diligence and atten tion. Some books, also, may be read by deputy, and ex tracts made of them by others ; but that should be only in the less important arguments, and the meaner sort of books, else distilled books are like common distilled waters, flashy things. Reading maketh a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an exact man. And, therefore, if a man write little, he had need have a great memory \u2022 if he confer little, he had need have a present wit ; and if he read little, he had need have much cunning to seem to know that he doth not. Bacon. CHAPTER X. ON satirical wit. Trust me, this unwary pleasantry of thine will, sooner or later, bring thee into scrapes and difficulties which no after wit can extricate thee out of. In these sallies too oft I see it happens that the person laughed at considers himself in the light of a person injured, with all the rights of such a situation belonging to him \u2022 and when thou viewest him in that light too, and reckonest upon his friends, his family, his kindred and allies, and musterest up with them the many recruits which will list under him from a sense of common danger, 'tis no extravagant arithmetic to say that for every ten jokes thou hast got an hundred enemies ; and till thou"], [77, "63 didactic pieces. hast gone on and raised a swarm of wasps about thine ears, and art half stung to death by them, thou wilt never be convinced it is so. I cannot suspect it in the man whom I esteem, that there is the least spur from spleen or malevolence of intent iu these sallies. I believe and know them to be truly honest and sportive * but consider, that fools cannot distinguish this, and that knaves will not ; and thou knowest not what it is, either to provoke the one, or to make merry with the other ; whenever they associate for mutual defence, depend upon it they will carry on the war in such a manner against thee, my dear friend, as to make thee heartily sick of it, and of thy life too. Revenge, from some baneful corner, shall level a tale of dishonour at thee, which no innocence of heart, or integrity of conduct, shall set right. The fortunes of thy house shall totter \u2014 thy character, which led the way to them, shall bleed on every side of it \u2014 thy faith questioned \u2014 thy works belied \u2014 thy wit forgotten \u2014 thy learning trampled on. To wind up the last scene of thy tragedy, Cruelty and Cowardice, twin ruffians, hired and set on by Malice, in the dark, shall strike together at all thy infirmities and mistakes ; the best of us, my friend, lie open there, and trust me \u2014 when to gratify a private appetite it is once resolved upon that an innocent and an helpless creature shall be sacrificed \u2014 it is an easy matter to pick up sticks enough from any thicket where it has strayed, to make a fire to offer it up with.

But if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had as lieve the town crier had spoke my lines. And do not saw the air too much with your hand thus * but use all gently ; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of your passion, you must ac quire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. Oh ! it offends me to the soul, to hear a robusteous periwig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings ; who (for the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise ; I could have such a fellow whipp'd for o'erdoing termagant ; it out-herods Herod. Pray you, avoid it. Be not too tame, neither ; but let your own discretion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature : for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing ; whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to na ture ; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time, his form and pressure. Now, this over-done, or come tardy of, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve : the censure of one of which must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. Oh ! there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not to speak it profanely), that, neither having the accent of Christian, nor the gait of Christian, Pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed, that I have thought some of na ture's journeymen had made men, and not made them well , they imitated humanity so abominably."], [79, "65 didactic pieces. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them : for there be of them that will them selves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too ; though, in the mean time, some necessary ques tion of the play be then to be considered : \u2014 that's villanous ; and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Shakespeare. CHAPTER XII. the present condition of man vindicated. Heaven from all creatures hides the book of Fate, All but the page prescribed, their present state : From brutes what men, from men what spirits know, Or who could suffer being here below ? The lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to-day, Had he thy reason, would he skip and play ? Pleased to the last, he crops the flowery food, And licks the hand just raised to shed his blood. Oh, blindness to the future ! kindly given, That each may fill the circle mark'd by Heaven \u2022 Who sees with equal eye, as God of all, A hero perish, or a sparrow fall, Atoms or systems into ruin hurl'd, And now a bubble burst, and now a world. Hope humbly then ; with trembling pinions soar ; ] Wait the great teacher Death ; and God adore. What future bliss, He gives not thee to know, But gives that Hope to be thy blessing now. Hope springs eternal in the human breast ; Man never is, but always to be blest : The soul, uneasy and confined from home, Rests and expatiates in a life to come."], [80, "66 didactic pieces. Lo, the poor Indian ! whose untutor'd mind Sees God in clouds, or hears Him in the wind * His soul proud Science never taught to stray Far as the solar walk or milky way ; Yet simple nature to his hope has given, Behind the cloud-topt hill, an humbler heaven * Some safer world in depth of woods embraced, Some happier island in the wat'ry waste, Where slaves once more their native land behold, No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold. To be, contents his natural desire, He asks no angel's wing, no seraph's fire : But thinks, admitted to that equal sky, His faithful dog shall bear him company. Go, wiser thou ! and in thy scale of sense, Weigh thy opinion against Providence ; Call imperfection what thou fanciest such, Say, here He gives too little, there too much : Destroy all creatures for thy sport or gust, Yet cry, if man 's unhappy, God 's unjust ; If man alone engross not Heaven's high care, Alone made perfect here, immortal there : Snatch from his hand the balance and the rod, Re-judge his justice, be the God of God. In Pride, in reasoning pride, our error lies ; All quit their sphere, and rush into the skies. Pride still is aiming at the blest abodes, Men would be angels, angels would be gods. Aspiring to be gods, if angels fell, Aspiring to be angels, men rebel : And who but wishes to invert the laws Of Order, sins against th' Eternal Cause. Pope."], [81, "didactic pieces. 67 CHAPTER XIII. ON THE ORDER OF NATURE. See, through this air, this ocean, and this earth, All matter quick, and bursting into birth. Above, how high, progressive life may go ! Around, how wide ! how deep extend below ! Vast chain of being ! which from God began, Nature ethereal, human \u25a0 angel, man * Beast, bird, fish, insect, what no eye can see, No glass can reach ; from Infinite to thee, From thee to nothing. \u2014 On superior powers Were we to press inferior might on ours : Or in the full creation leave a void, Where, one step broken, the great scale 's destroy'd From Nature's chain whatever link you strike, Tenth or ten thousandth, breaks the chain alike. And if each system in gradation roll Alike essential to th' amazing whole, The least confusion but in one, not all That system only, but the whole must fall. Let earth, unbalanced from her orbit fly, Planets and suns run lawless through the sky \u2022 Let ruling angels from their spheres be hurl'd, Being on being wreck'd, and world on world : Heaven's whole foundations to their centre nod, And nature trembles to the throne of God. All this dread Order break \u2014 for whom ? for thee ? Vile worm ! \u2014 Oh madness ! pride ! impiety ! What if the foot, ordain'd the dust to tread, Or hand, to toil, aspired to be the head ? What if the head, the eye, or ear repined To serve mere engines to the ruling mind 1"], [82, "68 DIDACTIC PIECES. Just as absurd for any part to claim. To be another in this general frame : Just as absurd to mourn the tasks or pains, The great directing Mind of All ordains. All are but parts of one stupendous whole, Whose body Nature is, and God the soul : That, changed through all, and yet in all the same, Great in the earth, as in th' ethereal frame, Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze, Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees, Lives thro' all life, extends thro' all extent, Spreads undivided, operates unspent ; Breathes in our soul, informs our mortal part, As full, as perfect, in a hair as heart * As full, as perfect, in vile man that mourns, As the rapt seraph that adores and burns : To Him no high, no low, no great, no small ; He fills, he bounds, connects, and equals all. Cease, then, nor Order imperfection name : Our proper bliss depends on what we blame. Know thy own point : This kind, this due degree Of blindness, weakness, Heaven bestows on thee. Submit. \u2014 In this, or any other sphere, Secure to be as blest as thou canst bear : Safe in the hand of one disposing Power, Or in the natal, or the mortal hour. All nature is but art, unknown to thee ; All chance, direction, which thou canst not see * All discord, harmony not understood ; All partial evil, universal good : And, spite of pride, in erring reason's spite, One truth is clear, Whatever is, is right. Pope."], [83, "DIDACTIC PIECES. 69 CHAPTER XIV. THE ORIGIN OF SUPERSTITION AND TYRANNY. Who first taught souls enslaved, and realms undone, Th' enormous faith of many made for one ; That proud exception to all Nature's laws, T' invert the world and counter-work its cause ? Force first made conquest, and that conquest, law ; 'Till superstition taught the tyrant awe, Then shared the tyranny, then lent it aid, And gods of conquerors, slaves of subjects made : She 'midst the lightning's blaze, and thunder's sound, When rock'd the mountains, and when groan'd the ground, She taught the weak to bend, the proud to pray, To power unseen, and mightier far than they : She, from the rending earth and bursting skies, Saw gods descend, and fiends infernal rise : Here fix'd the dreadful, there the blest abodes \u25a0 Fear made her devils, and weak hope her gods ; Gods partial, changeful, passionate, unjust, Whose attributes were rage, revenge, or lust ; Such as the souls of cowards might conceive, And, form'd like tyrants, tyrants would believe. Zeal then, not charity, became the guide ; And hell was built ou spite, and heaven on pride. Then sacred seem'd th' ethereal vault no more ; Altars grew marble then, and reek'd with gore : Then first the Flamen tasted living food \u2022 Next his grim idol smear'd with human blood ; With heaven's own thunders shook the world below, And play'd the god an engine on his foe. So drives self-love, thro' just and thro' unjust, To one man's power, ambition, lucre, lust :"], [84, "70 DIDACTIC PIECES. The same self-love, in all, becomes the cause Of what restrains him, government and laws. For, what one likes if others like as well, What serves one will, when many wills rebel ? How shall he keep, what, sleeping or awake, A weaker may surprise, a stronger take ? His safety must his liberty restrain : All join to guard what each desires to gain. Forced into virtue thus by self-defence, Even kings learn'd justice and benevolence : Self-love forsook the path it first pursued, And found the private in the public good. 'Twas then, the studious head or generous mind, Follower of God, or friend of humankind, Poet or patriot, rose but to restore The faith and moral Nature gave before ; Re-lumed her ancient light, nor kindled new ; If not God's image, yet his shadow drew : Taught power's due use to people and to kings. Taught nor to slack, nor strain its tender strings, The less, the greater, set so justly true, That touching one must strike the other too \u2022 'Till jarring interests, of themselves create Th' according music of a well-mix'd state. Such is the world's great harmony, that springs From order, union, full consent of things : Where small and great, where weak and mighty, made To serve, not suffer, strengthen, not invade ; More powerful each as needful to the rest, And, in proportion as it blesses, blest ; Draw to one point, and to one centre bring Beast, man, or angel, servant, lord, or king. For forms of government let fools contest ; Whate'er is best administer'd is best :"], [85, "71 DIDACTIC PIECES. For modes of faith let graceless zealots fight ; His can't be wrong whose life is in the right : In faith and hope the world will disagree, But all mankind's concern is charity : All must be false that thwart this one great end ; And all of God, that bless mankind or mend. Man, like the gen'rous vine, supported lives * The strength he gains is from th' embrace he gives. On their own axis as the planets run, Yet make at once their circle round the sun ; So two consistent motions act the soul * And one regards itself, and one the whole. Thus God and nature link'd the general frame, And bade self-love and social be the same. Pope. CHAPTER XV. ON HAPPINESS. 0 Happiness ! our being's end and aim ! Good, Pleasure, Ease, Content ! whate'er thy name : That something still which prompts th' eternal sigh, For which we bear to live, or dare to die ; Which still so near us, yet beyond us lies, O'erlook'd, seen double, by the fool and wise. Plant of celestial seed ! if dropt below, Say, in what mortal soil thou deign'st to grow 1 Fair opening to some Court's propitious shine, Or deep with diamonds in the flaming mine ? Twined with the wreaths Parnassian laurels yield, Or reap'd in iron harvest of the field ? Where grows ? \u2014 where grows it not ? If vain our toil, We ought to blame the culture, not the soil :"], [86, "72 DIDACTIC PIECES. Fix'd to no spot is Happiness sincere, 'Tis nowhere to be found, or everywhere ; 'Tis never to be bought, but always free, And, fled from monarchs, St. John ! dwells with thee. Ask of the learn'd the way ? the learn' d are blind : This bids to serve, and that to shun mankind ; Some place the bliss in action, some in ease, Those call it Pleasure, and Contentment these ; Some sunk to beasts, find pleasure end in pain ; Some swell'd to gods, confess e'en Virtue vain ; Or indolent, to each extreme they fall, To trust in everything, or doubt of all. Who thus define it, say they more or less Than this, that Happiness is Happiness ? Take Nature's path, and mad opinions leave ; All states can reach it, and all heads conceive ; Obvious her goods, in no extreme they dwell ; There needs but thinking right, and meaning well ; And mourn our various portions as we please, Equal is Common Sense and Common Ease. Remember, Man, \"the Universal Cause Acts not by partial, but by general laws ; \" And makes what Happiness we justly call, Subsist not in the good of one, but all. There 's not a blessing individuals find, But some way leans and hearkens to the kind : No Bandit fierce, no Tyrant mad with pride, No cavern'd Hermit rests self-satisfy'd ; Who most to shun or hate Mankind pretend, Seek an admirer, or would fix a friend : Abstract what others feel, what others think, All pleasures sicken, and all glories sink : Each has his share \u25a0 and who would more obtain, Shall find the pleasure pays not half the pain."], [87, "73 DIDACTIC PIECES. Order is Heaven's first law ; and this confess'd, Some are, and must be, greater than the rest, More rich, more wise ; but who infers from hence That such are happier, shocks all common sense. Heaven to mankind impartial we confess, If all are equal in their Happiness : But mutual wants this Happiness increase * All Nature's diff 'rence keeps all Nature's peace. Condition, circumstance, is not the thing ; Bliss is the same in subject or in king ; In who obtain defence, or who defend, In him who is, or him who finds, a friend: Heaven breathes thro' every member of the whole One common blessing, as one common soul. But Fortune's gifts if each alike possess' d, And each were equal, must not all contest ? If then to all men Happiness was meant, God in Externals could not place Content. Fortune her gifts may variously dispose, And these be happy call'd, unhappy those ; But Heaven's just balance equal will appear, While those are placed in Hope, and these in Fear : Not present good or ill, the joy or curse, But future views of better, or of worse. O sons of earth ! attempt ye still to rise, By mountains piled on mountains, to the skies ? Heaven still with laughter the vain toil surveys, And buries madmen in the heaps they raise. Know all the good that individuals find, Or God and Nature meant to mere mankind, Reason's whole pleasure, all the joys of Sense, Lie in three words, Health, Peace, and Competence. Pope. E"], [88, "74 DIDACTIC PIECES. CHAPTER XVI. ON VIRTUE. Know thou this truth (enough for man to know), \" Virtue alone is happiness below.\" The only point where human bliss stands still, And tastes the good without the fall to ill ; Where only Merit constant pay receives, Is blest in what it takes, and what it gives ; The joy unequall'd, if its end it gain, And if it lose, attended with no pain : Without satiety, tho' e'er so bless'd, And but more relish'd as the more distress'd : The broadest mirth unfeeling Folly wears, Less pleasing far than Virtue's very tears : Good, from each object, from each place acquired, For ever exercised, yet never tired ; Never elated, while one man 's oppress'd * Never dejected, while another 's bless'd ; And where no wants, no wishes can remain, Since but to wish more Virtue, is to gain. See the sole bliss Heaven could on all bestow ! Which who but feels can taste, but thinks can know Yet poor with fortune, and with learning blind, The bad must miss ; the good, untaught, will find \u2022 Slave to no sect, who takes no private road, But looks thro' Nature up to Nature's God ; Pursues .that Chain which links th' immense design, Joins heaven and earth, and mortal and divine \u2022 Sees that no being any bliss can know, But touches some above, and some below ! Learns, from this union of the rising Whole, The first, last purpose of the human soul ;"], [89, "75 DIDACTIC PIECES. And knows where Faith, Law, Morals, all began, All end, in Love of God, and Love of Man. For him alone Hope leads from goal to goal, And opens still, and opens on his soul \u25a0 'Till lengthen'd on to Faith, and unconfined, It pours the bliss that fills up all the mind. He sees why Nature plants in Man alone Hope of known bliss, and Faith in bliss unknown : (Nature, whose dictates to no other kind Are given in vain, but what they seek they find) Wise is her present \u25a0 she connects in this His greatest virtue with his greatest bliss ; At once his own bright prospect to be blest, And strongest motive to assist the rest. Self-love thus push'd to social, to divine, Gives thee to make thy neighbour's blessing thine. Is this too little for the boundless heart . Extend it, let thy enemies have part : Grasp the whole worlds of reason, life, and sense, In one close system of benevolence : Happier as kinder, in whate'er degree, And height of bliss but height of chfirity. God loves from whole to parts : but human soul Must rise from individual to the whole. Self-love but serves the virtuous mind to wake, As the small pebble stirs the peaceful lake ; The centre moved, a circle strait succeeds, Another still, and still another spreads * Friend, parent, neighbour, first it will embrace ; His country next ; and next all human race \u25a0 Wide and more wide, the o'erflowings of the mind Take every creature in of every kind ; Earth smiles around, with boundless bounty blest, And Heaven beholds its image in his breast. Pope, e 2"], [90, "76 DIDACTIC PIECES. CHAPTER XVII. ON VERSIFICATION. Many by numbers judge a Poet's song ; And smooth or rough, with them, is right or wrong ; In the bright muse though thousand charms conspire, Her voice is all these tuneful fools admire ; Who haunt Parnassus but to please their ear, Not mend their minds * as some to church repair Not for the doctrine but the music there. These equal syllables alone require, Though oft the ear the open vowels tire ; While expletives their feeble aid do join ; And ten low words oft creep in one dull line : While they ring round the same unvary'd chimes, With sure returns of still expected rhymes * Where'er you find \" the cooling western breeze,\" In the next line, it \" whispers thro' the trees :\" If crystal streams \" with pleasing murmurs creep,\" The reader 's threaten'd \u2014 not in vain \u2014 with \" sleep Then, at the last and only couplet fraught With some unmeaning thing they call a thought, A needless Alexandrine ends the song, That, like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along. Leave such to tune their own dull rhymes, and know What 's roundly smooth, or languishingly slow ; And praise the easy vigour of a line, Where Denham's strength, and Waller's sweetness join. True ease in writing comes from art, not chance, As those move easiest who have learn'd to dance. 'Tis not enough no harshness gives offence, The sound must seem an echo to the sense :"], [91, "DIDACTIC PIECES. 77 Soft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows, And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows ; But when loud surges lash the sounding shore, The hoarse, rough verse should like the torrent roar : When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw, The line too labours, and the words move slow ; Not so, when swift Camilla scours the plain, Flies o'er th' unbending* corn, and skims along the main. Hear how Timotheus' vary'd lays surprise, And bid alternate passions fall and rise ! While, at each change, the son of Libyan Jove Now burns with glory, and then melts with love ; Now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow, Now sighs steal out, and tears begin to flow : Persians and Greeks like turns of nature found, And the world's victor stood subdued by sound ! Pope. CHAPTER XVIII. ELEGY TO A YOUNG NOBLEMAN LEAVING THE UNIVERSITY. Ere yet, ingenuous youth, thy steps retire From Cam's smooth margin, and the peaceful vale, Where Science call'd thee to her studious quire, And met thee musing in her cloisters pale ; Oh ! let thy friend \u2014 and may he boast the name \u2014 Breathe from his artless reed one parting lay ! A lay like this thy early virtues claim, And this let voluntary friendship pay. Yet know, the time arrives, the dangerous time, When all those virtues, opening now so fair, * Might not this word \u2014 one of the slowest in the language, and which is designed to express the swiftness of Camilla \u2014 be advan tageously substituted by the rapid term glittering? \u2014 {Note by the Editor)."], [92, "78 DIDACTIC PIECES.

There if ambition, pestilent and pale, Or luxury, should taint their vernal glow; If cold self-interest with her chilling gale, Should blast the unfolding blossoms ere they blow ; If mimic hues, by art, or fashion spread, Their genuine, simple colouring should supply ; Oh ! with them may these laureate honours fade ; And with them \u2014 if it can \u2014 my friendship die. \u2014 And do not blame, if, though thyself inspire, Cautious I strike the panegyric string ; The muse full oft pursues a meteor fire, And vainly venturous, soars on waxen wing. Too actively awake at friendship's voice, The poet's bosom pours the fervent strain, 'Till sad reflection blames the hasty choice, And oft invokes oblivion's aid in vain. Go then, my friend, nor let thy candid breast Condemn me, if I check the plausive string ; Go to the wayward -world \u2022 complete the rest ; Be what the purest muse would wish to sing. Be still thyself ; that open path of truth, Which led thee here, let manhood firm pursue * Retain the sweet simplicity of youth, And all thy virtue dictates, dare to do. Still scorn, with conscious pride, the mask of art ; On vice's front let fearful caution lower, And teach the diffident discreeter part Of knaves that plot, and fools that fawn for power.

Procrastination is the thief of time ; Year after year it steals, till all are fled, And to the mercies of a moment leaves The vast concerns of an eternal scene. Of man's miraculous mistakes, this bears The palm, \" That all men are about to live,\" For ever on the brink of being born. All pay themselves the compliment to think They, one day, shall not drivel * and their pride On this reversion takes up ready praise \u2022 At least, their own ; their future selves applauds ; How excellent that life they ne'er will lead ! Time lodged in their own hands is folly's vails ; That lodged in fate's to wisdom they consign \u2022 The thing they can't but purpose, they postpone. 'Tis not in folly, not to scorn a fool ; And scarce in human wisdom to do more. All promise is poor dilatory man, And that thro' every stage.

PLEASURES ARISING FROM A CULTIVATED IMAGINATION. 0 blest of Heaven, whom not the languid songs Of luxury, the syren ! not the bribes Of sordid wealth, nor all the gaudy spoils Of pageant honour, can seduce to leave Those ever-blooming sweets, which from the store Of nature, fair imagination culls To charm th' enliven'd soul ! What tho' not all Of mortal offspring can attain the height Of envied life; tho' only few possess Patrician treasures or imperial state ; Yet Nature's care, to all her children just, With richer treasure and an ampler state Endows at large whatever happy man Will deign to use them.

Whate'er adorns The princely dome, the column and the arch, The breathing marbles and the sculptured gold, Beyond the proud possessor's narrow claim, His tuneful breast enjoys.

Each passing hour sheds tribute from her wings ; And still new beauties meet his lonely walk, And loves unfelt attract him. Not a breeze Flies o'er the meadow, not a cloud imbibes The setting sun's effulgence, not a strain From all the tenants of the warbling shade Ascends, but whence his bosom can partake Fresh pleasure unreproved.

But if to ampler prospects, if to gaze On Nature's form, where negligent of all These lesser graces, she assumes the port Of that eternal Majesty that weigh-'d The world's foundations ; if to these the mind Exalts her daring eye \u2022 then mightier far Will be the change, and nobler. Would the forms Of servile custom cramp her generous powers ? - Would sordid policies, the barbarous growth Of ignorance and rapine, bow her down To tame pursuits, to indolence and fear ?

Akenside. CHAPTER XXI. ON THE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL. Among other excellent arguments for the immortality of the soul, there is one drawn from the perpetual progress of the soul to its perfection, without a possibility of ever arriving at it ; which is a hint that I do not remember to have seen opened and improved by others who have written on this sub ject, though it seems to me to carry a great weight with it. How can it enter into the thoughts of man, that the soul, which is capable of such immense perfections, and of receiv- ing new improvements to all eternity, shall fall away into nothing almost as soon as it is created ! Are such abilities made for no purpose 1 A brute arrives at a point of perfec- tion that he can never pass ; in a few years he has all the endowments he is capable of ; and were he to live ten thou sand more, would be the same thing he is at present. Were a human soul thus at a stand in her accomplishments \u2014 were her faculties to be full blown, and incapable of further en largements \u2014 I could imagine it might fall away insensibly and drop at once into a state of annihilation. But can we believe a thinking being, that is in a perpetual progress of improvements, and travelling on from perfection to perfection, after having just looked abroad into the works of its Creator, and made a few discoveries of his infinite goodness, wisdom,"], [97, "83 DIDACTIC PIECES. and power, must perish at her first setting out, and in the very beginning of her inquiries 1 Man considered in his present state, seems only sent into the world to propagate his kind. He provides himself with a successor, and immediately quits his post to make room for him. He does not seem born to enjoy hfe, but to deliver it down to others. This is not surprising to consider, in animals, which are formed for our use, and can finish their business in a short life. The silk-worm, after having spun her task, lays her eggs and dies. But in this life man can never take in his full measure of knowledge ; nor has he time to subdue his passions, establish his soul in virtue, and come up to the perfection of his nature, before he is hurried off the stage. Would an infinitely wise Being make such glorious creatures for so mean a purpose ? Can He delight in the production of such abortive intelligences, such short-lived reasonable beings ? Would He give us talents that are not to be exerted ? Capacities that are never to be gratified ? How can we find that wisdom which shines through all his works, in the formation of man, without looking on this world as only a nursery for the next, and believing that the several generations of rational creatures, which rise up and disappear in such quick successions, are only to receive their first rudi ments of existence here, and afterwards to be transplanted into a more friendly climate, where they may spread and flourish to all eternity ? There is not, in my opinion, a more pleasing and triumphant consideration in religion, than this of the perpetual progress which the soul makes towards the perfection of its nature, without ever arriving at a period in it. To look upon the soul as going on from strength to strength, to consider that she is to shine for ever with new accessions of glory, and brighten to all eternity ; that she will be still adding virtue to virtue, and knowledge to knowledge ; carries in it some-"], [98, "84 DIDACTIC PIECES. thing wonderfully agreeable to that ambition which is na tural to the mind of man. Nay, it must be a prospect pleas ing to God himself, to see his creation for ever beautifying in his eyes, and drawing nearer to Him by greater degrees of resemblance. Methinks this single consideration of the progress of a finite spirit to perfection, will be sufficient to extinguish all envy in inferior natures, and all contempt in superior. That cherubim, which now appears as a God to a human soul, knows very well that the period will come about in eternity, when the human soul shall be as perfect as he himself now is ; nay, when she shall look down upon that degree of perfection, as much as she now falls short of it. It is true, the higher nature still advances, and by that means preserves his distance and superiority, in the scale of being ; but he knows that, how high soever the station is of which he stands possessed at present, the inferior n&ture will at length mount up to it, and shine forth in the same degree of glory. With what astonishment and veneration may we look into our souls, where there are such hidden stores of virtue and knowledge, such inexhausted sources of perfection ! AVe know not yet what we shall be, nor will it ever enter into the heart of man to conceive the glory that will be always in reserve for him. The soul, considered in relation to its Creator, is like one of those mathematical lines that may draw nearer to another for all eternity, without a possibility of touching it \u2022 and can there be a thought so transport ing, as to consider ourselves in these perpetual approaches to Him who is not only the standard of perfection, but of happiness ?

Yes, noble lady, I swear by this blood, which was once so pure, and which nothing but royal villany could have pol luted, that I will pursue Lucius Tarquinius the proud, his wicked wife, and their children, with fire and sword \u2022 nor will I ever suffer any of that family, or of any other what soever, to be king in Rome. Ye gods, I call you to witness this my oath ! There, Romans, turn your eyes to that sad spectacle \u2014 the daughter of Lucretius, Collatinus's wife \u2014 she died by her own hand. See there a noble lady, whom the lust of a Tarquin reduced to the necessity of being her own executioner to attest her innocence. Hospitably entertained by her as a kinsman of her husband Sextus, the perfidious guest became her brutal ravisher. The chaste, the generous Lucretia could not survive the insult. Glorious woman ! But once only treated as a slave, she thought life no longer to be endured. Lucretia, a woman, disdained a life that depended on a tyrant's will ; and shall we, shall men, with such an example before our eyes, and after five-and-twenty years of ignominious servitude, shall we, through a fear of dying, defer one single instant to assert our liberty ? No, Romans, now is the time ; the favourable moment we have so long waited for is come. Tarquin is not at Rome. The"], [100, "86 ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. patricians are at the head of the enterprise. The city is abundantly provided with men, arms, and all things neces sary. There is nothing wanting to secure the success if our own courage does not fail us. And all those warriors, who have ever been so brave when foreign enemies were to be subdued, or when conquests were to be made to gratify the ambition and avarice of Tarquin, be they only cowards when they are to deliver themselves from slavery ? Some of you are, perhaps, intimidated by the army which Tarquin now commands. The soldiers, you imagine, will take the part of their general. Banish so groundless a fear. The love of liberty is natural to all men. Your fellon*- citizens in the camp feel the weight of oppression with as quick a sense as you that are in Rome * they will as eagerly sieze the occa sion of throwing off the yoke. But let us grant there may be some among them who, through baseness of spirit, or a bad education, will be disposed to favour the tyrant. The number of these can be but small, and we have means suffi cient in our hands to reduce them to reason. They have left us hostages more dear to them than life. Their wives, their children, their fathers, their mothers are here in the city. Courage, Romans, the gods are for us ; those gods whose temples and altars the impious Tarquin has profaned by sacrifices and libations made with polluted hands, polluted with blood, and with numberless unexpiated crimes com mitted against his subjects. Ye gods, who protected our forefathers, ye genii, who watch for the preservation and glory of Rome, do you inspire us with courage and unani mity in this glorious cause, and we will, to our last breath, defend your worship from all profanation.

I know not, soldiers, whether you or your prisoners be en compassed by fortune with the stricter bonds and necessities. Two seas enclose you on the right and left \u2014 not a ship to flee to for escaping. Before you is the Po, a river broader and more rapid than the Rhone ; behind you are the Alps, over which, even when your numbers were undiminished, you were hardly able to force a passage. Here then, soldiers, you must either conquer or die the very first hour you meet the enemy. But the same fortune which has thus laid you under the necessity of fighting, has set before your eyes those rewards of victory than which no men are ever wont to wish for greater from the immortal gods. Should we, by our valour, recover only Sicily and Sardinia, which were ravished from our fathers, those would be no inconsiderable prizes. Yet, what are these ? The wealth of Rome, whatever riches she has heaped together in the spoils of nations, all these, with the masters of them, will be yours. You have been long enough employed in driving the cattle upon the vast mountains of Lusitania and Celtiberia ; you have hitherto met with no reward worthy of the labours and dangers you have undergone. The time is now come to reap the full recompense of your toilsome marches over so many mountains and rivers, and through so many nations, all of them in arms. This is the place which fortune has appointed to be the limits of your labours ; it is here that you will finish your glorious warfare, and receive an ample recom pense of your completed service. For I would not have you imagine that victory will be as difficult as the name of a Roman war is great and sounding. It has often happened"], [102, "88 ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. that a despised enemy has given a bloody battle, and the most renowned kings and nations have, by a small force, been overthrown. And if you but take away the glitter of the Roman name, what is there wherein they may stand in competition with you ? For (to say nothing of your service in war for twenty years together with so much valour and success) from the very pillars of Hercules, from the ocean, from the utmost bounds of the earth, through so many war like nations of Spain and Gaul, are you not come hither vic torious ? And with whom are you now to fight ? With raw soldiers, an undisciplined army, beaten, vanquished, besieged by the Gauls the very last summer, an army unknown to their leader, and unacquainted with him. Or shall I, who was born, I might almost say, but cer tainly brought up, in the tent of my father, that most excel lent general\u2014 shall I, the conqueror of Spain and Gaul, and not only of the Alpine nations, but, which is greater yet, of the Alps themselves, shall I compare myself with this half year captain ? a captain before whom should one place the two armies without their ensigns, I am persuaded he would not know to which of them he is consul ? I esteem it no small advantage, soldiers, that there is not one among you who has not often been an eye-witness of my exploits in war ; not one of whose valour I myself have not been a spectator, so as to be able to name the times and places of his noble achievements ; that with soldiers whom I have a thousand times praised and rewarded, and whose pupil I was before I became their general, I shall march against an army of men strangers to one another. On what side soever I turn my eyes I behold all full of courage and strength ; a veteran infantry, a most gallant cavalry \u2022 you, my allies, most faithful and valiant ; you, Carthaginians, whom not only your country's cause, but the justest anger, impels to battle. The hope, the courage of"], [103, "ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. 89 assailants, is always greater than of those who act upon the defensive. With hostile banners displayed, you are come down upon Italy ; you bring the war. Grief, injuries, indig nities fire your minds, and spur you forward to revenge ! First, they demanded me, that I, your general, should be delivered up to them \u2022 next, all of you who had fought at the siege of Saguntum \u2022 and we were to be put to death by the extremest tortures. Proud and cruel nation ! Every thing must be yours, and at your disposal ! You are to pre scribe to us with whom we shall make war, with whom we shall make peace \u2022 you are to set us bounds, to shut us up within hills and rivers \u2022 but you, you are not to observe the limits which yourselves have fixed ! Pass not the Iberus. What next 1 Touch not the Saguntines \u2022 Saguntum is upon the Iberus \u2014 move not a step towards that city. Is it a small matter, then, that you have deprived us of our ancient possessions, Sicily and Sardinia ? you would have Spain, too. Well, we shall yield Spain, and then \u2014 you will pass into Africa. Will pass, did I say ? This very year they ordered one of their consuls into Africa, the other into Spain. No, soldiers, there is nothing left for us but what we can vindicate with our swords. Come on then. Be men. The Romans may with more safety be cowards * they have their own country behind them, have places of refuge to flee to, and are secure from danger in the roads thither \u2022 but for you there is no middle fortune between death and victory.

MARIUS TO THE ROMANS, ON THEIR HESITATING TO APPOINT HIM GENERAL IN THE EXPEDITION AGAINST JUGURTHA, MERELY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS EXTRACTION. It is but too common, my countrymen, to observe a ma terial difference between the behaviour of those who stand candidates for places of power and trust, before and after their obtaining them. They solicit them in one manner, and execute them in another. They set out with a great appearance of activity, humility and moderation ; and they quickly fall into sloth, pride, and avarice. It is, undoubtedly, no easy matter to dischai*ge, to the general satisfaction, the duty of a supreme commander in troublesome times. I am, I hope, duly sensible of the importance of the office I pro pose to take upon me, for the service of my country. To carry on, with effect, an expensive war, and yet be frugal of the public money ; to oblige those to serve whom it may be delicate to offend * to conduct, at the same time, a compli cated variety of operations ; to concert measures at home answerable to the state of things abroad ; and to gain every valuable end, in spite of opposition from the envious, the factious, and the disaffected ; to do all this, my countrymen, is more difficult than is generally thought. And, besides the disadvantages, which are common to me with all others in eminent stations, my case is, in this respect, peculiarly hard ; that, whereas a commander of patrician rank, if he is guilty of a neglect or breach of duty, has his great connections, the antiquity of his family, the important services of his ances tors, and the multitudes he has by power engaged in his interest, to screen him from condign punishment, my whole safety depends upon myself; which renders it the more indispensably necessary for me to take care that my conduct be clear and unexceptionable. Besides, I am well aware, my"], [105, "91 ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. countrymen, that the eye of the public is upon me ; and that, though the impartial, who prefer the real advantage of the commonwealth to all other considerations, favour my pretensions, the patricians want nothing so much as an occa sion against me. It is, therefore, my fixed resolution, to use my best endeavours that you be not disappointed in me, and that their indirect designs against me may be defeated. I have, from my youth, been familiar with toils, and with dan gers. I was faithful to your interest, my countrymen, when I served you for no reward but that of honour. It is not my design to betray you, now that you have conferred upon me a place of profit. You have committed to my conduct the war against Jugurtha. The patricians are offended at this. But where would be the wisdom of giving such a command to one of their honourable body, a person of illustrious birth, of -ancient family, of innumerable statues, but \u2014 of no expe rience ? What service would his long line of dead ancestors, or his multitude of motionless statues, do his country in the day of battle ? What could such a general do, but, in his trepi dation and inexperience, have recourse to some inferior com mander, for direction in difficulties, to which he was not himself equal 1 Thus your patrician general would, in fact, have a general over him ; so that the acting commander would still be a plebeian. So true is this, my countrymen, that I have myself known those who have been chosen con suls, begin then to read the history of their own country, of which till that time they were totally ignorant ; that is, they first obtained the employment, and then bethought them selves of the qualifications necessary for the proper discharge of it. I submit to your judgment, Romans, on which side the advantage lies, when a comparison is made between pa trician haughtiness and plebeian experience. The very action which they have only read, I have partly seen and partly myself achieved. What they know by reading, I know by action. They are pleased to slight my mean birth :"], [106, "92 ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. I despise their mean characters. Want of birth and fortune is the objection against me : want of personal worth against them. But are not all men of the same species ? What can make a difference between one man and another but the en dowments of the mind ? For my part, I shall always look upon the bravest man as the noblest man. Suppose it were inquired of the fathers of such patricians as Albinus and Bestia, whether, if they had their choice, they would desire sons of their character, or of mine ; what would they an swer : but that they should wish the worthiest to be their sons ? If the patricians have reason to despise me, let them likewise despise their ancestors, whose nobility was the fruit of their virtue. Do they envy the honours bestowed upon me ? Let them envy likewise my labours, my abstinence, and the dangers I have undergone for my country ; by which I have acquired them. But those worthless men lead such a life of inactivity, as if they despised any honours you can bestow ; whilst they aspire to honours, as if they had de served them by the most industrious virtue. They arrogate the rewards of activity for their having enjoyed the pleasures of luxury. Yet none can be more lavish than they are in praise of their ancestors. And they imagine they honour themselves by celebrating their forefathers. Whereas they do the very contrary. For as much as their ancestors were distinguished for their virtues, so much are they disgraced by their vices. The glory of ancestors casts a light, indeed, upon their posterity : but it only serves to show what the descendants are. It alike exhibits to public view their de generacy and their worth. I own, I cannot boast of the deeds of my forefathers : but I hope I may answer the cavils of the patricians, by standing up in defence of what I have myself done. Observe, now, my countrymen, the injustice of the patricians. They arrogate to themselves honours on account of the exploits done by their forefathers, whilst they will not allow me the due praise for performing the very"], [107, "ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. 93 same sort of actions in my own person. He has no statues, they cry, of his family. He can trace no venerable line of ancestors. \u2014 What then ! Is it matter of more praise to dis grace one's illustrious ancestors than to become illustrious by his own good behaviour ? What if I can show no statues of my family ? I can show the standards, the armour, and the trappings, which I have myself taken from the van quished; I can show the scars of those wounds which I have received by facing the enemies of my countiy. These are my statues. These are the honours I boast of; not left me by inheritance, as theirs ; but earned by toil, by abstinence, by valour, amidst clouds of dust and scenes of blood ; scenes of action, where those effeminate patricians, who endeavour, by indirect means, to depreciate me in your esteem, have never dared to show their faces. Sallust. CHAPTER IV. CALISTHENES' REPROOF OF CLEON'S FLATTERY TO ALEXANDER. If the king were present, Cleon, there would be no need of my answering to what you have just proposed. He would himself reprove you for endeavouring to draw him into an imitation of foreign absurdities, and for bringing envy upon him by such unmanly flattery. As he is absent, I take upon me to tell you in his name, that no praise is lasting but what is rational ; and that you do what you can to lessen his glory instead of adding to it. Heroes have never, among us, been deified, till after their death. And whatever may be your way of thinking, Cleon, for my part I wish the king may not, for many years to come, obtain that honour. You have mentioned, as precedents of what you propose, Hercules and Bacchus. Do you imagine, Cleon, that they were deified over a cup of wine 1 And are you and I qualified to make"], [108, "94 ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. gods? Is the kiug, our sovereign, to receive his divinity from you and me, who are his subjects? First try your power whether you can make a king. It is surely easier to make a king than a god ? to give an earthly dominion than a throne in heaven. I only wish that the gods may have heard, without offence, the arrogant proposal you have made, of adding one to their number ; and that they may still be so propitious to us as to grant the continuance of that success to our affairs with which they have hitherto favoured us. For my part, I am not ashamed of my country ; nor do I ap prove of our adopting the rites of foreign nations, or learning from them how we ought to reverence our kings. To receive laws or rules of conduct from them, what is it, but to con fess ourselves inferior to them ?. Quintus Curtius. CHAPTER V. THE SCYTHIAN AMBASSADORS TO ALEXANDER. If your person were as gigantic as your desires, the world would not contain you. Your right hand would touch the east, and your left the west, at the same time. You grasp at more than you are equal to. From Europe you reach Asia : from Asia you lay hold on Europe. And if you should conquer all mankind you seem disposed to wage war with woods and snows, with rivers and wild beasts, and to attempt to subdue nature. But have you considered the usual course of things ? Have you reflected that great trees are many years in growing to their height, and are cut down in an hour ? It is foolish to think of the fruit only, without considering the height you have to climb, to come at it. Take care lest, while you strive to reach the top, you fall to the ground with the branches you have laid hold on. The lion, when dead, is devoured by ravens, and rust consumes"], [109, "95 ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. the hardness of iron. There is nothing so strong, but it is in danger from what is weak. It will, therefore, be your wisdom to take care how you venture beyond your reach. Besides, what have you to do with the Scythians, or the Scythians with you ? We have never invaded Macedon ; why should you attack Scythia ? We inhabit vast deserts and pathless woods, where we do not want to hear of the name of Alexander. We are not disposed to submit to slavery; and we have no ambition to tyrannize over any nation. That you may understand the genius of the Scythians, we present you with a yoke of oxen, an arrow, and a goblet. We use these respectively in our commerce with friends, and with foes. We give to our friends the corn, which we raise by the labour of our oxen. With the goblet we join with them in pouring drink-offerings to the gods ; and with arrows we attack our enemies. We have conquered those who have attempted to tyrannize over us in our own country, aud likewise the kings of the Medes and Persians, when they made unjust war upon us ; and we have opened to ourselves a way into Egypt. You pretend to be the punisher of robbers ; and are yourself the general robber of mankind. You have taken Lydia : you have seized Syria : you are master of Persia : you have subdued the Bactrians : and attacked India. Ail this will not satisfy you, unless you lay your greedy and insatiable hands upon our flocks and our herds. How imprudent is your conduct ! You grasp at riches, the possession of which only increases your ava rice. You increase your hunger by what should produce satiety; so that the more you have, the more you desire. But have you forgot how long the conquest of the Bactrians detained you ? While you were subduing, them, the Sog dians revolted. Your victories serve no other purpose, than to find you employment by producing new wars. For the business of every conquest is twofold ; to win, and to pre serve. And though you may be the greatest of warriors,"], [110, "96 ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. you must expect that the nations you conquer will endeavour to shake off the yoke as fast as possible. For what people chooses to be under foreign dominion ? If you will cross the Tanais, you may travel over Scythia, and observe how extensive a territory we inhabit. But to conquer us is quite another business. Your army is loaded with the cumbrous spoils of many nations. You will find the poverty of the Scythians, at one time, too nimble for your pursuit ; and at another time, when you think we are fled far enough from you, you will have us surprise you in your camp. For the Scythians attack with no less vigour than they fly. Why should we put you in mind of the vastness of the country you will have to conquer ? The deserts of Scythia are com monly talked of in Greece ; and all the world knows, that our delight is to dwell at large, and not in towns or planta tions. It will therefore be your wisdom to keep with strict attention what you have gained. Catching at more, you may lose what you have. We have a proverbial saying in Scythia, That fortune has no feet, and is furnished only with hands, to distribute her capricious favours, and with fins, to elude the grasp of those to whom she has been bountiful. You give yourself out to be a god, the son of Jupiter Ham mon. It suits the character of a god to bestow favours on mortals, not to deprive them of what they have. But if you are no god, reflect on the precarious condition of humanity. You will thus show more wisdom than by dwelling on those subjects which have puffed up your pride, and made you forget yourself. You see how little you are likely to gain by attempting the conquest of Scythia. On the other hand, you may, if you please, have in us a valuable alliance. We command the borders of both Europe and Asia. There is nothing between us and Bactria, but the river Tanais ; and our territory extends to Thrace, which, as we have heard, borders on Macedon. If you decline attacking us in a hostile manner, you may have our friendship. Na-"], [111, "97 ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. tions which have never been at war are on an equal footing. But it is in vain, that confidence is reposed in a conquered people. There can be no sincere friendship between the op pressor and the oppressed. Even in peace, the latter think themselves entitled to the rights of war against the former. We will, if you think good, enter into a treaty with you, according to our manner, which is, not by signing, sealing, and taking the gods to witness, as is the Grecian custom, but by doing actual services. The Scythians are not used to promise, but to perform without promising. And they think an appeal to the gods superfluous ; for that those, who have no regard for the esteem of men, will not hesitate to offend the gods, by perjury. You may therefore consider with yourself whether you had better have a people of such a character, and so situated as to have it in their power either to serve you, or to annoy you, according as you treat them, for allies, or for enemies. Quintus Curtius. CHAPTER VI. GALGACUS, THE GENERAL OF THE CALED0NII, TO HIS ARMY, TO INCITE THEM TO ACTION AGAINST THE ROMANS. When I reflect on the causes of the war, and the circum stances of our situation, I feel a strong persuasion that our united efforts on the present day will prove the beginning of universal liberty to Britain. For none of us are hitherto debased by slavery ; and we have no prospect of a secure re treat behind us, either by land or sea, whilst the Roman fleet hovers around. Thus the use of arms, w*hich is at all times honourable to the brave, here offers the only safety even to cowards. In all the battles which have yet been fought with various success against the Romans, the resources of hope and aid were in our hands ; for we, the noblest inhabi tants of Britain, and therefore stationed in the deepest re cesses, far from the view of servile shores, have preserved F"], [112, "98 ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. even our eyes unpolluted by the contact of subjection. We, at the farthest limits both of land and liberty, have been de fended to this day by the obscurity of our situation and of our fame. The extremity of Britain is now disclosed; and whatever is unknown becomes an object of importance.* But there is no nation beyond us ; nothing but waves and rocks ; and the Romans are before us. The arrogance of these invaders it will be in vain to encounter by obsequious ness and submission. These plunderers of the world, after exhausting the land by their devastations, are rifling the ocean : stimulated by avarice, if their enemy be rich ; by ambition, if poor : unsatiated by the East and by the West : the only people who behold wealth and indigence with equal avidity. To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire ; and assuming the desolation of solitude for the pledge of tranquillity, when they make a desert, they call it peace. Our children and relations are by the appointment of nature rendered the dearest of all things to us. These are torn away by levies to foreign servitude. Our wives and sisters, though they should escape the violation of hostile force, are polluted under the names of friendship and hospi tality. Our estates and possessions are consumed in tri butes ; our grain in contributions. Even the powers of our bodies are worn down amidst stripes and insults in clearing woods and draining marshes. Wretches born to slavery are first bought, and afterwards fed by their masters : Britain continually buys, continually feeds her own servitude. And as among domestic slaves every new comer serves for the scorn and derision of his fellows ; so, in this ancient house hold of the world, we, as the last and vilest, are sought out for destruction. For we have neither cultivated lauds, nor mines, nor harbours, which can induce them to preserve us for our labours ; and our valour and unsubmitting spirit * Pro magnifico est, \u2014 is over-rated. \u2014 (Note by the Editor.)"], [113, "99 ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. will only render us more obnoxious to our imperious masters ; while the very remoteness and secrecy of our situation, in proportion as it conduces to security, will tend to inspire suspicion. Since, then, all hopes of forgiveness are vain, let those at length assume courage, to whom glory, to whom safety is dear. The Brigantines, even under a female leader, had force enough to burn the enemy's settlements, to storm their camps ; and if success had not introduced negligence and inactivity, would have been able entirely to throw off the yoke : and shall not we, untouched, unsubdued, and struggling not for the acquisition, but the continuance of liberty, declare at the very first onset what kind of men Caledonia has reserved for her defence ? Can you imagine that the Romans are as brave in war as they are insolent in peace ? Acquiring renown from our discords and dissensions, they convert the errors of their enemies to the glory of their own army ; and an army com pounded of the most different nations, which, as success alone has kept together, misfortune will certainly dissipate. Un less, indeed, you can suppose that Gauls, and Germans, and (I blush to say it) even Britons, lavishing their blood for a foreign State, to which they have been longer foes than subjects, will be retained by loyalty and affection ! Terror and dread alone, weak bonds of attachment, are the ties by which they are restrained; and when these are once broken, those who cease to fear will begin to hate. Every incite ment to victory is on our side. The Romans have no wives to animate them ; no parents to upbraid then* flight. Most of them have either no habitation, or a distant one. Few in number, ignorant of the country, looking around in silent horror at the woods, seas, and a haven itself unknown to them, they are delivered by the gods as it were, imprisoned and bound, into our hands. Be not terrified with an idle show, and the glitter of silver and gold, which can neither protect nor wound. In the very ranks of the enemy we f 2"], [114, "100 ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. shall find our own bands. The Britons will acknowledge their own cause. The Gauls will recollect their former liberty. The Germans will desert them, as the Usipii have lately done. Nor is there anything formidable behind them ; ungarrisoned forts ; colonies of invalids, municipal towns distempered and distracted between unjust masters and ill obeying subjects. Here is your general ; here your army. There, tributes, mines, and all the train of servile punish ments ; which whether to bear eternally, or instantly to re venge, this field must determine. March, then, to battle, and think of your ancestors and your posterity. CHAPTER VII. SIR JOHN ST. AUBIN'S SPEECH FOR REPEALING THE SEPTENNIAL ACT. Mr. Speaker, \u2014 The subject-matter of this debate is of such importance, that I should be ashamed to return to my electors, without en deavouring, in the best manner I am able, to declare publicly the reason which induced me to give my most ready assent to this question. The people have an unquestionable right to frequent new Parliaments by ancient usage ; and this usage has been con firmed by several laws, which have been progressively made by our ancestors, as often as they found it necessary to insist on this essential privilege. Parliaments were generally annual, but never continued longer than three years, till the remarkable reign of Henry VIIL He, sir, was a prince of unruly appetites, and of an arbitrary will ; he was impatient of every restraint ; the laws of God and man fell equally a sacrifice, as they stood in the way of his avarice, or disappointed his ambition : he therefore introduced long Parliaments, because he very well"], [115, "101 ORATIONS and harangues. knew, that they would become the proper instruments of both ; and what a slavish obedience they paid to all his measures is sufficiently known. If we come to the reign of King Charles the First, we must acknowledge him to be a prince of a contrary temper ; he had certainly an innate love for religion and virtue. But here lay the misfortune \u2014 he was led from his natural dis position by sycophants and flatterers ; they advised him to neglect the calling of frequent new Parliaments, and there fore, by not taking the constant sense of his people in what he did, he was worked up into so high a notion of preroga tive, that the Commons \u2014 in order to restrain it \u2014 obtained that independent fatal power, which at last unhappily brought him to his most tragical end, and at the same time subverted the whole constitution. And I hope we shall learn this lesson from it, never to compliment the crown with any new or extravagant powers, nor to deny the people those rights, which by ancient usage they are entitled to : but to preserve the j ust and equal balance, from which they will both derive mutual security, and which, if duly ob served, will render our constitution the envy and admiration of all the world. King Charles the Second naturally took a surfeit of Par liaments in his father's time, and was therefore extremely desirous to lay them aside. But this was a scheme imprac ticable. However, in fact, he did so ; for he obtained a Parliament, which by its long duration, hke an army of veterans, became so exactly disciplined to his own measures, that they knew no other command but from that person who gave them their pay. This was a safe and most ingenious way of enslaving a nation. It was very well known, that arbitrary power, if it was open and avowed, would never prevail here. The people were therefore amused with the specious form of their ancient constitution : it existed, indeed, in their fancy ;"], [116, "102 ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. but, like a mere phantom, had no substance nor reality in it ; for the power, the authority, the dignity of parliaments were wholly lost. This was that remarkable parliament which so justly obtained the opprobrious name of the Pension Parliament ; and was the model from which, I believe, some later parliaments have been exactly copied. At the time of the Revolution, the people made a fresh claim of their ancient privileges ; and as they had so lately experienced the misfortune of long and servile parliaments, it was then declared, that they should be held frequently. But, it seems, their full meaning was not understood by this declaration ; and therefore, as in every new settlement the intention of all parties should be specifically manifested, the parliament never ceased struggling with the crown, till the triennial law was obtained ; the preamble of it is extremely full and strong ; and in the body of the bill you will find the word declared before enacted, by which I apprehend, that though this law did not immediately take place at the time of the Revolution, it was certainly intended as declaratory of their first meaning, and therefore stands a part of that original contract imder which the constitution was then settled. His Majesty's title to the crown is primarily de rived from that contract ; and if, upon a review, there shall appear to be any deviations from it, we ought to treat them as so many injuries done to that title. And I dare say, that this House, which has gone through so long a series of ser vices to his Majesty, will at last be willing to revert to those original stated measures of government, to renew and strengthen that title. But, sir, I think the manner in which the septennial law was first introduced, is a very strong reason why it should be repealed. People, in their fears, have very often recourse to desperate expedients, which, if not cancelled in season, will themselves prove fatal to that constitution, which they were meant to secure. Such is the nature of the septennial"], [117, "ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. 103 law ; it was intended only as a preservative against a tem porary inconvenience : the inconvenience is removed, but the mischievous effects still continue ; for it not only altered the constitution of parliaments, but it extended that same parliament beyond its natural duration ; and therefore carries t'ais most unjust implication with it, That you may at any time usurp the most indubitable, the most essential privilege of the people,\u2014 I mean that of choosing their own represen tatives. A precedent of such a dangerous consequence, of s\u00ab fatal a tendency, that I think it would be a reproach to eur statute book, if that law was any longer to subsist which night record it to posterity. This is a season of virtue and public spirit. Let us take advantage of it to repeal those laws which infringe our liberties, and introduce such as may restore the vigour of oar ancient constitution. Human nature is so very corrupt, that all obligations lose tleir force unless they are frequently renewed. Long par liaments become, therefore, independent of the people, and when they do so, there always happens a most dangerous dependence elsewhere. Long parliaments give the minister an opportunity of getting acquaintance with members, of practising his several aits to win them into his schemes. This must be the work of time. Corruption is of so base a nature, that at first sigit it is extremely shocking. Hardly anyone has sub mitted to it all at once. His disposition must be previously und-rstood \u2014 the particular bait must be found out with which he is to be allured ; and, after all, it is not without many struggles that he surrenders his virtue. Indeed, there are seme who will at once plunge themselves into any base action, but the generality of mankind are of a more cautious nature, and will proceed only by leisurely degrees. One or two, peihaps, have deserted their colours the first campaign,"], [118, "104 ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. some have done it a second, but a great many, who have not that eager disposition to vice, will wait till a third. For this reason, short parliaments have been less corrupt than long ones ; they are observed, like streams of water, always to grow more impure the greater distance they run from the fountain-head. I am aware it may be said that frequent new parliaments will produce frequent new expenses ; but I think quite the contrary ; I am really of opinion that it will be a proper remedy against the evil of bribery at elections, especially is you have provided so wholesome a law to co-operate upon these occasions. Bribery at elections, whence did it arise? Not from country gentlemen, for they are sure of being chosen with out it ; it was, sir, the invention of wicked and corrupt ministers, who have, from time to time, led weak princes into such destructive measures that they did not dare to rely upon the natural representation of the people. Long parliaments, sir, first introduced bribery, because they we'e worth purchasing at any rate. Country gentlemen, wlo have only their private fortunes to rely upon, and have no mercenary ends to serve, are unable to oppose it, especially if at any time the public treasure shall be unfaithful^ squandered away to corrupt their boroughs. Country gen tlemen, indeed, may make some weak efforts ; but as tley generally prove unsuccessful, and the time of a fresh struggle is at so great a distance, they at last grow faint in the dis pute, give up their country for lost, and retire in desnair. Despair naturally produces indolence, and that is the proper disposition for slavery. Ministers of state understand this very well, and are therefore unwilling to awaken the nation out of its lethargy by frequent elections. They kno.v that the spirit of liberty, like every other virtue of the nind, is to be kept alive only by constant action ; that it is impos-"], [119, "ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. 105 sible to enslave this nation while it is perpetually upon its guard. Let country gentlemen, then, by having frequent opportunities of exerting themselves, be kept warm and active in their contention for the public good ; this will raise that zeal and spirit which will at last get the better of those undue influences by which the officers of the crown, though unknown to the several boroughs, have been able to supplant country gentlemen of great characters and fortune who live in their neighbourhood. I do not say this upon idle specu lation only. I live in a country where it is too well known, and I appeal to many gentlemen in the House, to more out of it (and who are so for this very reason), for the truth of my assertion. Sir, it is a sore which has been long eating into the most vital part of our constitution, and I hope the time will come when you will probe it to the bottom. For if a minister should ever gain a corrupt familiarity with our boroughs \u2014 if he should keep a register of them in his closet, and, by sending down his treasury-mandates, should pi*ocure a spurious representative of the people, the offspring of his corruption, who will be at all times ready to reconcile and justify the most contradictory measures of his administra tion, and even to vote every crude, indigested dream of their patron into a law ; if the maintenance of his power should become the sole object of their attention, and they should be guilty of the most violent breach of parliamentary trust, by giving the king a discretionary liberty of taxing the people without limitation or control \u2014 the last fatal compliment they can pay to the crown ; if this should ever be the unhappy condition of this nation, the people, indeed, may complain ; but the doors of that place where the complaint should be heard will for ever be shut against them. Our disease, I fear, is of a complicated nature, and I think that this nation is wisely intended to remove the first and principal disorder. Give the people their ancient right of frequent new elections; that will restore the decayed f 3"], [120, "106 ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. authority of parliaments, and will put our constitution into a natural condition of working out her own cure. Sir, upon the whole, I am of opinion that I cannot ex press a greater zeal for his Majesty, for the liberties of the people, or the honour and dignity of this House, than by seconding the motion which the honourable gentleman has made you. CHAPTER VIIL SIR ROBERT WALPOLE'S REPLY, Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, Though the question has been already so fully opposed that there is no great occasion to say anything farther against it ; yet, I hope the House will indulge me the liberty of giving some of those reasons which induce me to be against the motion. In general, I must take notice that the nature of our constitution seems to be very much mistaken by the gen tlemen who have spoken in favour of this motion. It is certain that ours is a mixed government, and the perfection of our constitution consists in this, that the monarchical, aristocratical, and democratical forms of government are mixed and interwoven in ours so as to give us all the advan tages of each without subjecting us to the dangers and inconveniences of either. The democratical form of govern ment, which is the only one I have now occasion to take notice of, is liable to these inconveniences, That they are generally too tedious in their coming to any resolution, and seldom brisk and expeditious enough in carrying their reso lutions into execution ; that they are always wavering in their resolutions, and never steady in any of the measures they resolve to pursue ; and that they are often involved in factions, seditions, and insurrections, which exposes them to"], [121, "107 ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. be made the tools, if not the prey, of their neighbours ; therefore in all the regulations we make, with respect to our constitution, we are to guard against running too much into that form of government which is properly called democra tical : this was, in my opinion, the effect of the triennial law, and will again be the effect if ever it should be restored. That triennial elections would make our government too tedious in all their resolves is evident ; because, in such case, no prudent administration would ever resolve upon any measure of consequence till they had felt, not only the pulse of the parliament, but the pulse of the people ; and the ministers of state would always labour under this disadvan tage, that, as secrets of state must not be immediately di vulged, their enemies (and enemies they will always have) would have a handle for exposing their measures, and ren dering them disagreeable to the people, and thereby carrying, perhaps, a new election against them before they could have an opportunity of justifying their measures, by divulging those facts and circumstances from whence the justice and the wisdom of their measures would clearly appear. Then, sir, it is by experience well known, that what is called the populace of every country are apt to be too much elated with success, and too much dejected with every mis fortune ; this makes them wavering in their opinions about affairs of state, and never long of the same mind ; and as this House is chosen by the free and unbiassed voice of the people in general, if this choice were so often renewed we might expect that this House would be as wavering and as unsteady as the people usually are ; and it being impossible to carry on the public affairs of the nation without the con currence of this House, the ministers would always be obliged to comply, and, consequently, would be obliged to change their measures as often as the people changed their minds. With septennial parliaments, sir, we are not exposed to either of these misfortunes ; because, if the ministers, after"], [122, "108 ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. having felt the pulse of the parliament, which they can always soon do, resolve upon any measure, they have gene rally time enough, before the new elections come on, to give the people proper information, in order to show them the justice and the wisdom of the measures they have pursued ; and if the people should at any time be too much elated, or too much dejected, or should, without a cause, change their minds, those at the helm of affairs have time to set them right before a new election comes on. As to faction and sedition, sir, I will grant that in monar chical and aristocratical governments it generally arises from violence and oppression ; but in democratical governments, it always arises from the people's having too great a share in the government ; for in all countries, and in all govern ments, there always will be many factious and unquiet spirits, who can never be at rest either in power or out of power ; when in power they are never easy unless every man submits entirely to their direction ; and when out of power, they are always working and intriguing against those that are in, without any regard to justice, or to the interest of their country : in popular governments such men have too much game ; they have too many opportunities for working upon and corrupting the minds of the people, in order to give them a bad impression of, and to raise discontent against, those that have the management of the public affairs for the time ; and these discontents often break out into seditions and insurrections. This, sir, would, in my opinion, be our misfortune if our parliaments were either annual or triennial ; by such frequent elections there would be so much power thrown into the hands of the people as would destroy that equal mixture which is the beauty of our constitution ; in short, our government would really become a democratical government, and might from thence, very probably, diverge into a tyrannical. Therefore, in order to preserve our constitution, in order to prevent our falling"], [123, "ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. 109 under tyranny and arbitrary power, we ought to preserve that law, which I really think has brought our constitution to a more equal mixture, and consequently to greater perfec tion, than it was ever in before that law took place. As to bribery and corruption, sir, if it were possible to influence, by such base means, the majority of the electors of Great Britain, to choose such men as would probably give up their liberties ; if it were possible to influence, by such means, a majority of the members of this House, to consent to the establishment of arbitrary power, I would readily allow that the calculations made by the gentlemen of the other side were just, and their inference true ; but I am per suaded that neither of these is possible. As the members of this House generally are, and must always be, gentlemen of fortune and figure in their country, is it possible to suppose that any of them could, by a pension, or a post, be influenced to consent to the overthrow of our constitution, by which the enjoyment, not only of what he got, but of what he before had, would be rendered altogether precarious ? I will allow, sir, that with respect to bribery the price must be higher or lower, generally in proportion to the virtue of the man who is to be bribed ; but it must likewise be granted, that the humour he happens to be in at the time, the spirit he happens to be endowed with, adds a great deal to his virtue. When no encroachments are made upon the rights of the people, when the people do not think themselves in any danger, there may be many of the electors who, by a bribe of ten guineas, might be induced to vote for one can didate rather than another ; but if the court were making any encroachments upon the rights of the people, a proper spirit would, without doubt, arise iu the nation, and in such a case I am persuaded that none, or very few, even of such electors, could be induced to vote for a court candidate, no, not for ten times the sum. There may, sir, be some bribery and corruption in the"], [124, "110 ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. nation ; I am afraid there will always be some ; but it is no proof of it that strangers are sometimes chosen, for a gentle man may have so much natural influence over a borough in his neighbourhood as to be able to prevail with them to choose any person he pleases to recommend ; and if, upon such recommendation, they choose one or two of his friends, who are, perhaps, strangers to them, it is not from thence to be inferred that the two strangers were chosen their repre sentatives by the means of bribery and corrujjtion. To insinuate, sir, that money may be issued from the public treasury for bribing elections, is really something very extraordinary, especially in those gentlemen who know how many checks are upon every shilling that can be issued from thence, and how regularly the money granted in one year for the public service of the nation must always lie accounted for, the very next session, in this House and like wise in the other, if they have a mind to call for any such account. And as to the gentlemen in offices, if they have any advantage over country gentlemen in having something else to depend on besides their own private fortunes, they have likewise many disadvantages ; they are obliged to live at London with their families, by which they are put to a much greater expense than gentlemen of equal fortunes who live in the country ; this lays them under a very great dis advantage with respect to the supporting their interest in the country. The country gentleman, by living among the electors, and purchasing the necessaries for his family from them, keeps up an acquaintance and correspondence with them without putting himself to any extraordinary charge ; whereas a gentleman who lives in London has no other way of keeping up an acquaintance or correspondence among his friends in the country but by going down once or twice a year at a very extraordinary charge, and often without any other business, so that we may conclude a gentleman in office cannot, even in seven years, save much for distributing in"], [125, "ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. 111 ready money at the time of an election ; and I really believe, if the fact were narrowly inquired into, it would appear that the gentlemen in office are as little guilty of bribing their electors with ready money as any other set of gentlemen in the kingdom. That there are ferments often raising among the people without any just cause, is what I am surprised to hear con troverted, since very late experience may convince us of the contrary. Do not we know what a ferment was raised in the nation towards the latter end of the late queen's reign ? And it is well known what a fatal change in the affairs of this nation was introduced, or at least confirmed, by an elec tion's coming on while the nation was in that ferment. Do not we know what a ferment was raised in the nation soon after his late Majesty's accession ? And if an election had then been allowed to come on, while the nation was in that ferment, it might perhaps have had as fatal effects as the former ; but, thank God, this was wisely provided against by the very law which is now wanted to be repealed. As such ferments may hereafter often happen, I must think that frequent elections will always be dangerous ; for which reason, as far as I can see at present, I shall, I believe, at all times, think it a very dangerous experiment to repeal the Septennial Bill. CHAPTER IX. THE SPEECH OF BRUTUS ON THE DEATH OF C\u00c6SAR. Romans, countrymen, and lovers ! hear me for my cause, and be silent that you may hear. Believe me for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses that you may the better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of C\u00e6sar's, to him I say, that"], [126, "112 ORATIONS AND HARANGUES. Brutus's love to C\u00e6sar was no less than his. If, then, that friend demand why Brutus rose against C\u00e6sar, this is my answer : Not that I loved C\u00e6sar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather C\u00e6sar were living and die all slaves, than that C\u00e6sar were dead to live all freemen ? As C\u00e6sar loved me, I weep for him ; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it ; as he was valiant, I honour him ; but as he was ambi tious, I slew him. There are tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honour for his valour, and death for his ambition. Who's here so base that would be a bondman ? If any, speak, for him I have offended. Who's here so rude that would not be a Roman ? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who's here so vile that will not love his country ? if any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply. None ? then none have I offended. I have done no more to C\u00e6sar than you should do to Brutus. The question of his death is enrolled in the capital ; his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy ; nor his offences enforced for which he suffered death. Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying, a place in the commonwealth; as which of ycu shall not ? With this I depart, that as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death. Shakespear."], [127, "BOOK V. DIALOGUES. CHAPTER I. ON CRITICISM. And how did Garrick speak the soliloquy last night ? \u2014 Oh, against all rule, my lord, most ungrammatically ! betwixt the substantive and the adjective, which should agree to gether in number, case, and gender, he made a breach thus, \u2014 \u25a0 stopping as if the ]!>oint wanted settling; \u2014 and betwixt the no minative case and the verb, \u2014 which your lordship knows such case should govern, \u2014 he suspended his voice in the epilogue a dozen times, three seconds, and three fifths by a stop-watch, my lord, each time. \u2014 Admirable grammarian ! \u2014 But in suspend ing his voice, was the sense suspended likewise ; did no ex pression of attitude or countenance fill up the chasm ? Was the eye silent ? Did you narrowly look ? \u2014 I looked only at the stop-watch, my lord. \u2014 Excellent observer. And what of this new book the whole world makes such a rout about ? \u2014 Oh ! 'tis out of all plumb, my lord ; quite an irregular thing ! not one of the angles at the four corners was a right angle. I had my rule and compasses, <fcc., my lord, in my pocket. \u2014 Excellent critic. And for the epic poem your lordship bid me look at; upon taking the length, breadth, height, and depth of it, and try ing them at home upon an exact scale of Bossu's, 'tis out, my lord, in every one of its dimensions. \u2014 Admirable con noisseur."], [128, "114 DIALOGUES. And did you step in to take a look at the grand picture in your way back 1 \u2014 'Tis a melancholy daub, my lord ! not one principle of the pyramid in any one group ! and what a price ! \u2014 for there is nothing of the colouring of Titian, the expression of Rubens, the grace of Raphael, the purity of Domenichino, the corregiescity of Corregio, the learning of Poussin, the airs of Guido, the taste of the Carrachis, or the grand contour of Angelo. Grant me patience, just Heaven ! \u2014 Of all the cants which are canted in this canting world \u2014 though the cant of hypo crites may be the worst \u2014 the cant of criticism is the most tormenting. I would go fifty miles on foot to kiss the hand of that man whose generous heart will give up the reins of his imagination into his author's hands \u2014 be pleased he knows not why, and cares not wherefore. Sterne. CHAPTER II. ON NEGROES. When Tom, an' please your honour, got to the shop, there was nobody in it but a poor negro girl, with a bunch of white feathers slightly tied to the end of a long cane, flap ping away flies \u2014 not killing them. 'Tis a pretty picture ! said my uncle Toby \u2014 she had suffered persecution, Trim, and had learnt mercy \u2014 She was good, an' please your honour, from nature as well as from hardships ; and there are circumstances in the story of that poor friendless slut that would melt a heart of stone, said Trim ; and some dismal winter's evening, when your honour is in the humour, they shall be told you with the rest of Tom's story, for it makes a part of it \u2014 Then do not forget, Trim, said my uncle Toby."], [129, "DIALOGUES. 115 A negro has a soul, an' please your honour, said the cor poral (doubtingly). I am not much versed, corporal, quoth my uncle Toby, in things of that kind ; but I suppose God would not leave him without one, any more than thee or me. It would be putting one sadly over the head of another, quoth the corporal. It would so, said my uncle Toby. Why then, an' please your honour, is a black wench to be used worse than a white one ? I can give no reason, said my uncle Toby \u2014 Only, cried the corporal, shaking his head, because she has no one to stand up for her \u2014 'Tis that very thing, Trim, quoth my uncle Toby, which recommends her to protection, and her brethren with her ; \u2014 'tis the fortune of war which has put the whip into our hands now \u2014 where it may be hereafter, Heaven knows ! \u2014 but be it where it will, the brave, Trim, will not use it unkindly. God forbid, said the corporal. Amen, responded my uncle Toby, laying his hand upon his heart. Sterne. CHAPTER III. Sir John Falstaff, and Ford disguised as Brook. Bardolp>h. Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would fain speak with you, and be acquainted with you ; and hath sent your worship a morning's draught of sack. Falstaff. Brook is his name ? Bard. Aye, sir.

And you, sir : would you speak with me ? Ford, I make bold to press with so little preparation upon you. Fal. You're welcome. What's your will ? Give us leave, drawer. [Exit Bardolph. Ford. Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much ; my name is Brook. Fal. Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you. Ford. Good Sir John, I sue for yours : not to charge you ; for I must let you understand I think myself in better plight for a lender than you are : the which has something emboldened me to this unseasoned intrusion ; for they say, if money go before all ways do lie open. Fal. Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on. Ford. Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me : if you will help me to bear it, Sir John, take all, or half, for easing me of the carriage. Fal. Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter. Ford. I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing. Fal. Speak, good Master Brook ; I shall be glad to be your servant. Ford. Sir, I hear you are a scholar, \u2014 I will be brief with you ; \u2014 and you have been long known to me, though I had never so good means, as desire, to make myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine own imperfection ; but, good Sir John, as you have one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded, turn another into the register of your own ; that I may pass with a reproof the easier, since you yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender. Fal, Very well, sir; proceed. Ford. There is a gentlewoman in this town, her husband's name is Ford."], [131, "117 DIALOGUES. Fal. Well, sir. Ford. I have long loved her, and I protest to you be stowed much upon her, followed her with a doting observ ance ; engrossed opportunities to meet her ; fee'd every slight occasion that could niggardly give me sight of her ; not only bought many presents to give her, but have given largely to many, to know what she would have given : briefly, I have pursued her as love hath pursued me, \u2014 which hath been on the wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have merited, either in my mind or in my means, meed, I am sure, I have received none ; unless experience be a jewel ; that I have purchased at an infinite rate, and that hath taught me to say this : \u2014 Love like a shadow flies, when substance closely woos ; Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues. Fal. Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands ? Ford. Never. Fal. Have you importun'd her to such purpose ? Ford. Never. Fal. Of what quality was your love, then ? Ford. Like a fair house, built upon another man's land ; so that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place where I erected it. Fal. To what purpose have you unfolded this to me ? Ford, When I have told you that, I have told you all. Some say, that though she appear honest to me, yet, in other places she enlarges her mirth so far, that there is shrew'd construction made of her. Now, Sir John, here is the heart of my purpose : You are a gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your place and person, generally allowed for your many warlike, court-like, and learned preparations. Fal. 0, sir."], [132, "118 DIALOGUES. Ford. Believe it, for you know it. There is money ; spend it ; spend it ; spend more ; spend all I have ; only give me so much of your time in exchange of it, as to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this Ford's wife. Use your art of wooing, win her to consent to you ; if any man may, you may as soon as any. Fal. Would it apply well to the vehemency of your affec tion that I should win what you would enjoy ? Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously. Ford. 0, understand my drift ! She dwells so securely on the excellency of her honour, that the folly of my soul dares not present itself; she is too bright to be looked on. Now, could I come to her with any detection in my hand, my desires had instance and argument to commend them selves : I could drive her then from the ward of her purity, her reputation, her marriage vow, and a thousand other her defences, which now are too strongly embattled against me. What say you to 't, Sir John ? Fal. Master Brook, I will first make bold with your money ; next, give me your hand ; and last, as I am a gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife. The Merry Wives of Windsor. CHAPTER IV. SIR JOHN MELVIL AND STERLING. Sterl. What are your commands with me, Sir John ? Sir John. After having carried the negotiations between our families to so great a length, after having assented so readily to all your proposals, as well as received so many in stances of your cheerful compliance with the demands made on our part, I am extremely concerned, Mr. Sterling, to be the voluntary cause of any uneasiness. Sterl. Uneasiness \u2014 what uneasiness ? Where business is"], [133, "119 DIALOGUES. transacted as it ought to be, and the parties understand one another, there can be no uneasiness. You agree on such and such conditions, to receive my daughter for a wife ; on the same conditions I agree to receive you as a son-in-law; and as to all the rest, it follows of course, you know, as regularly as the payment of a bill after acceptance. Sir John. Pardon me, sir ; more uneasiness has arisen than you are aware of. I am myself, at this instant, in a state of inexpressible embarrassment. Miss Sterling, I know, is extremely disconcerted, too, and unless you will oblige me with the assistance of your friendship, I foresee the speedy progress of discontent and animosity through the whole family. Sterl. What the deuce is all this ? I do not understand a single syllable. Sir John. In one word, then, it will be absolutely im possible for me to fulfil my engagements in regard to Miss Sterling. Sterl. How, Sir John ? Do you mean to put an affront upon my family ? What ! refuse to \u2014 Sir John. Be assured, sir, that I neither mean to affront, nor forsake your family. My only fear is, that you should desert me ; for the whole happiness of my life de pends on my being connected with your family by the nearest and tenderest ties in the world. Sterl. Why did not you tell me but a moment ago it was absolutely impossible for you to marry my daughter ? Sir John. True ; but you have another daughter, sir \u2014 Sterl. Well? Sir John. Who has obtained the most absolute dominion over my heart. I have already declared my passion to her ; nay, Miss Sterling herself is also apprized of it, and if you will but give a sanction to my present addresses, the uncommon merit of Miss Sterling will no doubt recommend her to a person"], [134, "120 DIALOGUES. of equal, if not superior rank to myself, and our families may still be allied by my union with Miss Fanny. Sterl. Mighty fine, truly ! Why, what the plague do you make of us, Sir John? Do you come to market for my daughters like servants at a statute-fair ? Do you think that I will suffer you or any man in the world to come into my house, like the grand signior, and throw the handkerchief first to one and then to t'other, just as he pleases ? Do you think I drive a kind of African slave trade with them ? and \u2014 Sir John. A moment's patience, sir. Nothing but the excess of my passion for Miss Fanny should have induced me to take any step that had the least appearance of disre spect to any part of your family ; and even now I am de sirous to atone for my transgression, by making the most adequate compensation that lies in my power. Sterl. Compensation ! what compensation can you pos sibly make in such a case as this, Sir John ? Sir John. Come, come, Mr. Sterling ; I know you to be a man of sense, and a man of business, a man of the world. I will deal frankly with you ; and you shall see that I do not desire a change of measures for my own gratification, with out endeavouring to make it advantageous to you. Sterl. What advantage can your inconstancy be to me, Sir John? Sir John. I will tell you, sir. You know that, by the articles at present subsisting between us, on the day of my marriage with Miss Sterling, you agree to pay down the gross sum of eighty thousand pounds. Sterl. Well ! Sir John. Now if you will but consent to my waving that marriage \u2014 Sterl. I agree to your waving that marriage ? Impossible, Sir John."], [135, "121 DIALOGUES. Sir John. I hope not, sir ; as on my part, I will agree to wave my right to thirty thousand pounds of the fortune I was to receive with her. Sterl. Thirty thousand, do you say ? Sir John. Yes, sir ; and accept of Miss Fanny, with fifty thousand instead of fourscore. Sterl. Fifty thousand \u2014 Sir John. Instead of fourscore. Sterl. Why, why, there may be something in that. Let me see ; Fanny with fifty thousand instead of Betsey with fourscore. But how can this be, Sir John ? For you know I am to pay this money into the hands of my Lord Ogleby ; who, I believe, betwixt you and me, Sir John, is not over stocked with ready money at present ; and threescore thousand of it, you know, is to go to pay off the present in cumbrances on the estate, Sir John. Sir John. That objection is easily obviated. Ten of the twenty thousand, which would remain as a surplus of the fourscore, after paying off the mortgage, was intended by his Lordship for my use, that we might set off with some little eclat on our marriage ; and the other ten for his own. Ten thousand pounds, therefore, I shall be able to pay you imme diately ; and for the remaining twenty thousand you shall have a mortgage on that part of the estate which is to be made over to me, with whatever security you shall require for the regular payment of the interest, till the principal is duly discharged. Sterl. Why, to do you justice, Sir John, there is something fair and open in your proposal ; and since I find you do not mean to put an affront upon the family \u2014 Sir John. \u2014 Nothing was ever farther from my thoughts, Mr. Sterling. And after all, the whole affair is nothing ex traordinary ; such things happen every day ; and as the world had only heard generally of a treaty between the fami- G"], [136, "122 DIALOGUES. lies, when this marriage takes place nobody will be the wiser, if we have but discretion enough to keep our own counsel. Sterl. True, true ; and since you only transfer from one girl to the other, it is no more than transferring so much stock, you know. Sir John. The very thing. Sterl. Odso ! I had quite forgot. We are reckoning with out our host here. There is another difficulty \u2014 Sir John. You alarm me. What can that be ? Sterl. I cannot stir a step in this business without con sulting my sister Heidelberg. The family has very great expectations from her, and we must not give her any offence. Sir John. But if you come into this measure, surely she will be so kind as to consent \u2014 \u2022 Sterl. I do not know that. Betsey is her darling, and I cannot tell how far she may resent any slight that seems to be offered to her favourite niece. However, I will do the best I can for you. You shall go and break the matter to her first ; and by the time that I may suppose that your rhetoric has prevailed on her to listen to reason, I will step in to re inforce your arguments. Sir John. I will fly to her immediately ; you promise me your assistance ? Sterl. I do. Sir John. Ten thousand thanks for it ! and now success attend me. Sterl. Harkee, Sir John ! \u2014 Not a word of the thirty thou sand to my sister, Sir John. Sir John. Oh, I am dumb, I am dumb, sir. Sterl, You remember, it is thirty thousand. Sir John. To be sure I do. Sterl. But, Sir John ! one thing more. My Lord must know nothing of this stroke of friendship between us."], [137, "123 DIALOGUES. Sir John. Not for the world. Let me alone ! let me alone ! Sterl. And when everything is agreed, we must give each other a bond to be held fast to the bargain. Sir John. To be sure. A bond by all means ! a bond, or whatever you please. Sterl, I should have thought of more conditions ; he is in a humour to give me everything. Why, what mere children are your fellows of quality ; that cry for a plaything one minute, and throw it by the next \u2014 as changeable as the weather and as uncertain as the stocks. Special fellows to drive a bargain ! and yet they are to take care of the interest of the nation truly ! Here does this whirligig man of fashion offer to give up thirty thousand pounds, in hard money, with as much indifference as if it was a China orange. By this mortgage I shall have a hold on his terra firma ; and if he wants more money, as he certainly will, let him have children by my daughter or no, I shall have his whole estate in a net for the benefit of my family. Well ; thus it is, that the children of citizens who have acquired fortunes prove persons of fashion ; and thus it is, that persons of fashion, who have ruined their fortunes, reduce the next generation to cits. Clandestine Marriage. CHAPTER V. BELCOUR AND STOCKWELL. Stock. Mr. Belcour, I am rejoiced to see you ; you are welcome to England. Bel. I thank you heartily, good Mr. Stockwell ; you and I have long conversed at a distance ; now we are met, and the pleasure this meeting gives me amply compensates for the perils I have run through in accomplishing it. Stock. What perils, Mr. Belcour? I could not have g 2"], [138, "124 DIALOGUES. thought you would have met a bad passage at this time o' year. Bel, Nor did we : courier like, we came posting to your shores ; upon the pinions of the swiftest gales that ever blew ; it is upon English ground all my difficulties have arisen \u2022 it is the passage from the river side I complain of. Stock. Ay, indeed ! What obstructions can you have met between this and the river side ? Bel. Innumerable ! Your town 's as full of defiles as the island of Corsica, and I believe they are as obstinately de fended ; so much hurry, bustle and confusion on your quays ; so many sugar-casks, porter-buts and common council-men in your streets, that unless a man marched with artillery in his front, it is more than the labour of a Hercules can effect to make any tolerable way through your town. Stock. I am sorry you have been so incommoded. Bel. Why, faith, it was all my own fault ; accustomed to a land of slaves, and out of patience with the whole tribe of custom-house extortioners, boatmen, tide-waiters, and water bailiffs, that beset me on all sides, worse than a swarm of musquitoes, I proceeded a little too roughly to brush them away with my rattan ; the sturdy rogues took this in dud geon, and, beginning to rebel, the mob chose different sides, and a furious scuffle ensued, in the course of which my per son and apparel suffered so much that I was obliged to step into the first tavern to refit, before I could make my ap proaches in any decent trim. Stock. Well, Mr. Belcour, it is a rough sample you have had of my countrymen's spirit ; but I trust you will not think the worse of them for it. Bel. Not at all, not at all ; I like them the better ; was I only a visitor, I might, perhaps, wish them a little more tractable ; but, as a fellow-subject, and a sharer in their freedom, I applaud their spirit, though I feel the effects of it in every bone of my skin. Well, Mr. Stockwell, for the first"], [139, "DIALOGUES. 125 time in my life, here am I in England, at the fountain-head of pleasure \u2014 in the land of beauty, of arts, and elegancies. My happy stars have given me a good estate, and the con spiring winds have blown me hither to spend it. Stock. To use it, not to waste it, I should hope ; to treat it, Mr. Belcour, not as a vassal over whom you have a wanton despotic power, but as a subject which you are bound to go vern with a temperate and restrained authority. Bel. True, sir, most truly said ; mine 's a commission, not a right: I am the offspring of distress, and every child of sorrow is my brother ; while I have hands to hold, there fore, I will hold them open to mankind \u2014 but, sir, my pas sions are my masters ; they take me where they will, and oftentimes they leave to reason and virtue nothing but my wishes and my sighs. Stock. Come, come, the man who can accuse corrects himself. Bel. Ah ! that is an office I am weary of ; I wish a friend would take it up ; I would to Heaven you had leisure for the employ ! but, did you drive a trade to the four corners of the world, you would not find the task so toilsome as to keep me free from faults. Stock. Well, I am not discouraged ; this candour tells me I should not have the fault of self-conceit to combat ; that, at least, is not among the number. Bel. No ; if I knew that man on earth who thought more humbly of me than I do of myself, I would take up his opinion and forego my own. Stock. And, was I to choose a pupil, it should be one of your complexion ; so if you will come along with me, we will agree upon your admission, and enter upon a course of lectures directly. Bel. With all my heart. West Indian."], [140, "126 DIALOGUES. >> CHAPTER VI. DUKE AND LORD. Duke. Now, my co-mates, and brothers in exile, Hath not old custom made this life more sweet Than that of painted pomp ? Are not these woods More free from peril, than the envious court ? Here feel we but the penalty of Adam, The season's difference ; as the icy fang, And churlish chiding of the winter's wind ; Which, when it bites and blows upon my body, Even till I shrink with cold, I smile, and say, This is no flattery ; these are counsellors, That feelingly persuade me what I am. Sweet are the uses of adversity, Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous, Wears yet a precious jewel in his head ; And this our life, exempt from public haunt, Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, Sermons in stones, and good in every thing. Come, shall we go, and kill us venison ? And yet it irks me, the poor dappled fools, Being native burghers of this desert city, Should, in their own confines, with forked heads Have their round haunches gored. Lord. Indeed, my lord, The melancholy Jaques grieves at that ; And in that kind swears you do more usurp Than doth your brother that hath banished you. To-day my Lord of Amiens, and myself, Did steal behind him, as he lay along Under an oak, whose antique root peeps out Upon the brook that brawls along this wood ;"], [141, "DIALOGUES. 127 To the which place a poor sequestered stag, That from the hunters' aim had taken a hurt, Did come to languish ; and, indeed, my Lord, The wretched animal heaved forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting ; and the big round tears Coursed one another down his innocent cheeks In piteous chase ; and thus the hairy fool, Much marked of the melancholy Jaques, Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook, Augmenting it with tears. Duke. But what said Jaques ? Did he not moralize this spectacle ? Lord, 0 yes, into a thousand similies, First, for his weeping in the needless stream ; Poor deer, quoth he, thou mak'st a testament As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more To that which had too much. Then being alone, Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends ; 'Tis right, quoth he, thus misery doth part The flux of company. Anon a careless herd, Full of the pasture, jumps along by him,- And never stays to greet him ; Ay, quoth Jaques, Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens, 'Tis just the fashion : wherefore do you look Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there 1- Thus most invectively he pierceth through The body of the country, city, court, Yea, and of this our life ; swearing that we Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what 's worse, To fright the animals, and to kill them up In their assign'd and native dwelling-place. Duke. And did you leave him in this contemplation ? Lord. We did, my Lord, weeping and commenting Upon the sobbing deer."], [142, "128 DIALOGUES. Duke. Show me the place ; I love to cope him in these sullen fits, For then he 's full of matter. Lord. I '11 bring you to him strait. Shakespeare. CHAPTER VII. DUKE AND JAQUES. Duke. Why, how now, Monsieur, what a life is this, That your poor friend must woo your company ! What ! you look merrily. Jaq. A fool, a fool ; \u2014 I met a fool in the forest, A motley fool ; a miserable varlet ! As I do live by food, I met a fool. Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun, And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms, In good set terms, and yet a motley fool. Good morrow, fool, quoth I ; No, Sir, quoth he, Call me not fool, till Heaven hath sent me fortune ; And then he drew a dial from his poak, And looking on it with lack-lustre eye, Says very wisely, It is ten o'clock : Thus may we see, quoth he, how the world wags : 'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine, And after one hour more 't will be eleven ; And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe, And then from hour to hour we rot and rot, And thereby hangs a tale. When I did hear The motley fool thus moral on the time, My lungs began to crow like chanticleer, That fools should be so deep contemplative : And I did laugh, sans intermission, An hour by his dial. 0 noble fool, A worthy fool ! motley's the only wear."], [143, "129 DIALOGUES. Duke. What fool is this ? Jaq. 0 worthy fool ! one that hath been a courtier, And says, if ladies be but young and fair, They have the gift to know it : and in his brain, Which is as dry as the remainder-biscuit After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd With observations, the which he vents, In mangled forms. 0 that I were a fool ! I am ambitious for a motley coat. Duke. Thou shalt have one. Jaq. It is my only suit Provided that you weed your better judgments Of all opinion, that grows rank in them, That I am wise. I must have liberty Withal, as large a charter as the wind, To blow on whom I please ; for so fools have, And they that are most galled with my folly They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so ? The way is plain, as way to parish church ; He whom a fool does very wisely hit, Doth very foolishly, although he smart, Not to seem senseless of the bob. If not, The wise man's folly is anatomized Even by the squandering glances of a fool. Invest me in my motley, give me leave To speak my mind, and I will through and through Cleanse the foul body of the infected world, \u25a0If they will patiently receive my medicine. Duke. Fie on thee ! I can tell what thou wouldst do. Jaq. What, for a counter, would I do but good ? Duke. Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin ; For thou thyself hast been a libertine, And all th' embossed sores and headed evils, That thou with licence of free foot hast caught, Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world. g 3"], [144, "130 DIALOGUES. Jaq. Why, who cries out on pride, That can therein tax any private party ? Doth it not flow as hugely at the sea, Till that the very means do ebb ? What woman in the city do I name, When that I say, the city woman bears The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders ? Who can come in and say that I mean her ; When such a one as she, such is her neighbour ? Or what is he of basest function, That says his bravery is not on my cost ; Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits His folly to the metal of my speech ? There then; how then ? what then ? let me see wherein My tongue has wrong'd him ; if it do him right, Then he hath wrong'd himself, if he be free, Why, then my taxing, like a wild goose, flies Unclaimed of any man. Shakespeare. CHAPTER VIIL HENRY AND LORD CHIEF JUSTICE. Ch. Just. I am assured, if I be measured rightly, Your Majesty hath no just cause to hate me. P. Hen. No ! How might a prince of my great hopes forget So great indignities you laid upon me ? What ! rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison The immediate heir of England ! was this easy ? May this be wash'd in Lethe and forgotten ? Ch. Just. I then did use the person of your father ; The image of his power then lay in me : And in th' administration of his law, While I was busy for the commonwealth,"], [145, "131 DIALOGUES. Your highness pleased to forget my place, The majesty and power of law and justice, The image of the king whom I presented ; And struck me in my very seat of judgment : Whereon, as an offender to your father, I gave bold way to my authority, And did commit you. If the deed were ill, Be you contented, wearing now the garland, To have a son set your decrees at nought : To pluck down justice from your awful bench, To trip the course of law, and blunt the sword That guards the peace and safety of your person : Nay, more, to spurn at your most royal image, And mock your working in a second body, Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours ; Be now the father, and propose a son ; Hear your own dignity so much profaned ; See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted ; Behold yourself so by a son disdained : And then imagine me taking your pai*t, And in your power so silencing your son. After this cold considerance, sentence me ; And as you are a king, speak in your state, What I have done that misbecame my place, My person, or my liege's sovereignty. P. Henry. You are right, justice, and you weigh this well ; Therefore still bear the balance and the sword : And I do wish your honours may increase, Till you do live to see a son of mine Offend you, and obey you, as I did : So shall I live to speak my father's words : Happy am I that have a man so bold That dares do justice on my proper son ; And no less happy having such a son, That would deliver up his greatness so"], [146, "132 DIALOGUES. Into the hand of justice. \u2014 You committed me ; For which I do commit into your hand The unstained sword that you have used to bear ; With this remembrance, that you use the same With a like bold, just, aud impartial spirit, As you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand, You shall be as a father to my youth : My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear ; And I will stoop and humble my intents, To your well-practised wise directions. And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you ; My father is gone wild into his grave ; For in his tomb lie my affections ; And with his spirit sadly I survive, To mock the expectations of the world ; To frustrate prophecies, and to raze out Rotten opinion, which hath writ me down After my seeming. Though my tide of blood Hath proudly flowed in vanity till now, Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea, Where it shall mingle with the state of floods, And flow henceforth in formal majesty. Now call we our high court of Parliament ; And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel, That the great body of our state may go In equal rank with the best governed nation ; That war or peace, or both at once, may be As things acquainted and familiar to us, In which you, father, shall have foremost hand. Our coronation done, we will accite (As I before remembered) all our state, And (heaven consigning to my good intents) No prince, nor peer, shall have just cause to say, Heaven shorten Harry's happy life one day.

Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so; Nor shall you do mine ear that violence, To make it truster of your own report Against yourself. I know you are no truant ; But what is your affair in Elsinoor ? We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart. Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral. Ham. I pr'ythee do not mock me, fellow-student ; I think it was to see my mother's wedding. Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon. Ham, Thrift, thrift, Horatio ; the funeral baked meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables. Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven, Or ever I had seen the day, Horatio ! My father \u2014 methinks I see my father. Hor. Oh, where my lord ? Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio. Hor. I saw him once : he was a goodly king. Ham.

Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen, Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch, In the dead waste and middle of the night, Been thus encountered : A figure like your father, Armed at all points exactly, cap-ape, Appears before them, and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them ; thrice he walked By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes Within his truncheon's length ; whilst they (distill'd Almost to jelly with the effect of fear) Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did, And I with them th' third night kept the watch ; Where as they had deliver'd both in time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, The apparition comes. I know your father : These hands are not more like. Ham. But where was this ? Hor. My lord, upon the platform where we watch' d. Ham. Did you not speak to it ? Hor. My lord, I did ; But answer made it none.

Hold you the watch to night 1 Hor. We do, my lord. Ham. Arm'd, say you 1 Hor. Arm'd, my lord. Ham. From top to toe ? Hor. My lord, from head to foot. Ham. Then saw you not his face ? Hor. Oh, yes, my lord ; he wore his beaver up. Ham. What, look'd he frowningly ? Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger. Ham. Pale or red ? Hor. Nay, very pale. Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you ?

Will -you go see the order of the course ? Bru. Not I. Cas. I pray you, do. Bru. I am not gamesome ; I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony ; Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires : I'll leave you. Cas. Brutus, I do observe you now of late ; I have not from your eyes that gentleness And show of love as I was wont to have ; You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand Over your friend that loves you. Bru. Cassius, Be not deceived : if I have veil'd my look, I turn the trouble of my countenance Merely upon myself. Vexed I am Of late with passions of some difference, Conceptions only proper to myself; Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviour ; But let not therefore my good friends be grieved, Among which number, Cassius, be you one ; Nor construe any farther my neglect, Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war, Forgets the show of love to other men."], [151, "DIALOGUES. 137 Cas. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion ; By means whereof, this breast of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations. Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face ? Bru. No, Cassius ! for the eye sees not itself, But by reflection from some other thing. Cas. 'Tis just. And it is very much lamented, Brutus, That you have no such mirror as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye, That you might see your shadow. I have heard, Where many of the best respect in Rome, (Except immortal C\u00e6sar) speaking of Brutus, And groaning underneath this age's yoke, Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes. Bru. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius, That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me ? Cas. Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear ; And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection, I, your glass, Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which yet you know not of. And be not jealous of me, gentle Brutus : Were I a common laugher, or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protestor ; if you know That I do fawn on men, and hug them hard, And after scandal them ; or if you know, That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout \u2014 then hold me dangerous. Bru. What means this shouting ? I do fear the people Choose C\u00e6sar for their king. Cas. Ay, do you fear it ? Then must I think you would not have it so."], [152, "138 DIALOGUES. Bru. I would not, Cassius ; yet I love him well. But wherefore do you hold me here so long ? What is it that you would impart to me ? If it be aught toward the general good, Set Honour in one eye, and Death i' the other, And I will look on Death indifferently : For let the gods so speed me, as I love The name of honour more than I fear death. Cas. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus, As well as I do know your outward favour. Well, honour is the subject of my story. \u2014 I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life ; but for my single self, I had as lief not be, as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself. I was born free as C\u00e6sar ; so were you : We both have fed as well ; and we can both Endure the winter's cold as well as he. For once upon a raw and gusty day, The troubled Tyber chafing with his shores, C\u00e6sar says to me, Dar'st thou, Cassius, now Leap in with me into this angry flood, And swim to yonder's point ?\u2014 Upon the word, Accoutred as I was, I plunged in, And bid him follow ; so indeed he did. The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it With lusty sinews ; throwing it aside, And stemming it with hearts of controversy. But ere we could arrive the point proposed, C\u00e6sar cried, Help me, Cassius, or I sink.

'Tis true, this god did shake ; His coward lips did from their colour fly, And that same eye whose bend does awe the world, Did lose its lustre ; I did hear him groan : Ay, and that tongue of his, that bade the Romans Mark him, and write his speeches in their books, Alas ! it cried \u2014 Give me some drink, Titinius \u2014 As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me, A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world, And bear the palm alone. Bru. Another general shout !

Why man, he doth bestride the narrow world Like a colossus ! and we petty men Walk under his huge legs, and peep about To find ourselves dishonourable graves.

Bru, That you do love me, I am nothing jealous ; What you would work me to, I have some aim : How I have thought of this, and of these times, I shall recount hereafter : for this present, I would not (so with love I might intreat you) Be any further moved. What you have said, I will consider ; what you have to say, I will with patience hear ; and find a time Both meet to hear, and answer such high things. Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this ; Brutus had rather be a villager, Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under such hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us. Cas. I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus. Shakespeare. CHAPTER XI. BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, AND AVIRAGUS. Bel.

Gates of monarchs Are arch'd so high, that giants may jet through,"], [155, "141 dialogues. And keep their impious turbans on, without Good morrow to the run. Hail, thou fair heaven ! We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardly As prouder livers do. Guid, Hail, Heaven ! Arv. Hail, Heaven ! Bel. Now for our mountain sport, up to yond hill, Your legs are young. I'll tread these flats. Consider, When you, above, perceive me like a crow, That it is place which lessens and sets off : And you may then revolve what tales I told you, Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war ; That service is not service, so being done, But being so allowed. To apprehend thus Draws us a profit from all things we see ; And often, to our comfort, shall we find The sharded beetle in a safer hold, Than is the full-wing' d eagle. Oh, this life Is nobler than attending for a check ; Richer, than doing nothing for a bauble ; Prouder, than rustling in unpaid-for silk. Such gain the cap of him that makes them fine, Yet keeps his book uncrossed ; \u2014 no life to ours. Guid. Out of your proof you speak ; we, poor, unfledge Have never wing'd from you o' the nest ; nor know What air's from home. Haply this life is best, If quiet life is best ; sweeter to you, That have a sharper known ; well corresponding With your stiff age : but unto us it is A cell of ignorance ; travelling a-bed ; A prison, for a debtor that not dares To stride a limit. Arv. What should we speak of, When we are old as you ? When we shall hear The rain and the wind beat dark December ? how,"], [156, "142 DIALOGUES. In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse The freezing hours away ? We have seen nothing ; We're beastly ; subtle as the fox for prey, Like warlike as the wolf, for what we eat. Our valour is to choose what flies ; our cage We make a choir, as doth the prisoned bird, And sing our bondage freely. Bel. How you speak ! Did you but know the city's usuries, And felt them knowingly ; the art o' the court, As hard to leave as keep ; whose top to climb Is certain falling ; or so slippery, that The fear's as bad as falling ; the toil of war ; A pain that only seems to seek our danger F the name of fame and honour ; which dies i' the search, And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph, As record of fair act ; nay, many time, Doth ill deserve by doing well : what 's worse, Must curt'sy at the censure. \u2014 Oh, boys, this story The world might read in me : my body's mark'd With Roman swords ; and my report was once First with the best of note. Cymbeline loved me ; And when a soldier was the theme, my name Was not far off : then was I as a tree, AVhose bows did bend with fruit. But, in one night A storm, or robbery, call it what you will, Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves ; And left me bare to weather. Guid. Uncertain favour ! Bel. My fault being nothing, as I have told you oft, But that two villains (whose false oaths prevail'd Before my perfect honour) swore to Cymbeline I was confederate with the Romans : so Follow'd my banishment ; and, this twenty years, This rock and these demesnes have been my world ;"], [157, "143 DIALOGUES.

Dear Sensibility ! source inexhausted of all that 's precious in our joys, or costly in our sorrows! thou chainest thy martyr down upon his bed of straw, and it is thou who liftest him up to heaven. Eternal fountain of our feelings ! It is here I trace thee, and this is thy divinity which stirs within me : not, that in some sad and sickening moments, ' my soul shrinks back upon herself, and startles at destruc tion,' \u2014 mere pomp of words ! \u2014 but that I feel some generous joys and generous cares beyond myself \u2014 all comes from thee, great, great sensorium of the w*orld ! which vibrates, if a hair of our head but falls upon the ground, in the remotest desert of thy creation. Touched with thee, Eugenius draws my curtain when I languish ; hears my tale of symptoms, and blames the weather for the disorder of his nerves. Thou givest a portion of it sometimes to the roughest peasant who traverses the bleakest mountains. He finds the lacerated lamb of another's flock. This moment I beheld him leaning with his head against his crook, with piteous inclination looking down upon it. Oh ! had I come one moment sooner ! \u2014 it bleeds to death \u2014 his gentle heart bleeds with it. Peace to thee, generous swain !

Disguise thyself as thou wilt, still, Slavery ! still thou art a bitter draught ; and though thousands in all ages have been made to drink of thee, thou art no less bitter on that ac count. It is thou, Liberty, thrice sweet and gracious goddess, whom all, in public or in private, worship, whose taste is grateful, and ever will be so, till nature herself shall change \u2014 no tint of words can spot thy snowy mantle, or chemic power turn thy sceptre into iron \u2014 with thee to smile upon him as he eats his crust the swain is happier than his monarch from whose court thou art exiled. Gracious Heaven ! grant me but health, thou great bestower of it, and give me but this fair goddess as my companion ; and shower down thy mitres, if it seems good unto thy divine providence, upon those heads which are aching for them. \u2014 Pursuing these ideas, I sat down close by my table, and leaning my head upon my hand, I began to figure to myself the miseries of confinement. I was in a right frame for it, and so I gave full scope to my imagination. I was going to begin with the millions of my fellow creatures born to no inheritance but slavery ; but finding, however affecting the picture was, that I could not bring it nearer me, and that the multitude of sad groups in it did but distract me \u2014 \u2014 I took a single captive, and having first shut him up in his dungeon, I then looked through the twilight of his grated door to take his picture. I beheld his body half wasted away with long expectation and confinement, and felt what kind of sickness of the heart it was which arises from hope deferred. Upon looking nearer I saw him pale and feverish : in thirty years the western breeze had not once fanned his, blood \u2014 he had seen n"], [160, "146 DESCRIPTIVE PIECES. no sun, no moon in all that time \u2014 nor had the voice of friend or kinsman breathed through his lattice. His children \u2014 \u2014 But here my heart began to bleed \u2014 and I was forced to go on with another part of the portrait. He was sitting upon the ground upon a little straw, in the furthest corner of his dungeon, which was alternately his chair and bed : a little calendar of small sticks were laid at the head, notched all over with the dismal days and nights he had passed there\u2014 he had one of these little sticks in his hand, and with a rusty nail he was etching another day of misery to add to the heap. As I darkened the little light he had, he lifted up a hopeless eye towards the door, then cast it down, shook his head, and went on with his work of affliction. I heard his chains upon his legs, as he turned his body to lay his little stick upon the bundle. He gave a deep sigh \u2014 I saw the iron enter into his soul \u2014 I burst into tears \u2014 I could not sustain the picture of confinement which my fancy had drawn. Sterne. CHAPTER III. CORPORAL TRIM'S ELOQUENCE. My young master in London is dead, said Obadiah. Here is sad news, Trim, cried Susannah, wiping her eyes as Trim stepped into the kitchen ; master Bobby is dead. I lament for him from my heart and my soul, said Trim, fetching a sigh, \u2014 poor creature ! poor boy ! poor gentleman ! He was alive last Whitsuntide, said the coachman. Whit suntide ! alas ! cried Trim, extending his right arm, and falling instantly into the same attitude in which he read the sermon, \u2014 what is Whitsuntide, Jonathan (for that was the coachman's name), or Shrovetide, or any tide or time past, to this ? Are we not here now, continued the corporal striking the end of his stick perpendicular upon the floor, so as to"], [161, "147 DESCRIPTIVE PIECES. give an idea of health and stability), and are we not (drop ping his hat upon the ground) gone ! in a moment ! \u2014 It was infinitely striking. Susannah burst into a flood of tears. We are not stocks and stones \u2014 Jonathan, Obadiah, the cook-maid, all melted. The foolish fat scullion herself, who was scouring a fish-kettle upon her knees, was roused with it. The whole kitchen crowded about the corporal. \" Are we not here now, and gone in a moment ?\" \u2014 There was nothing in the sentence ; it was one of your self-evident truths we have the advantage of hearing every day ; and if Trim had not trusted more to his hat than his head, he had made nothing at all of it. Are we not here now, continued the corporal, and are we not (dropping his hat plump upon the ground, and paus ing before he pronounced the word) gone ! in a moment ? The descent of the hat was as if a heavy lump of clay had been kneaded into the crown of it. Nothing could have ex pressed the sentiment of mortality, of which it was the type and forerunner, like it. His hand seemed to vanish from under it ; it fell dead, the corporal's eye fixed upon it, as upon a corpse, \u2014 and Susannah burst into a flood of tears. Sterne. CHAPTER IV. THE MAN OF ROSS. All our loud praises why should lords engross? Rise, honest Muse ! and sing the Man of Ross : Pleased Vaga echoes through her winding bounds, And rapid Severn hoarse applause resounds.

Is any sick ? The Man of Ross relieves, Prescribes, attends, the med'cine makes and gives. Is there a variance ? Enter but his door, Balk'd are the courts, and contest is no more.

Blush, grandeur, blush ! proud courts, withdraw your blaze ! Ye little stars, hide your diminish'd rays. And what ! no monument, inscription, stone ? His race, his form, his name almost unknown ! Who builds a church to God, and not to Fame, Will never mark the marble with his name : Go search it there, where to be born and die, Of rich and poor makes all the history ; Enough, that Virtue fill'd the space between ; Proved by the ends of being to have been.

Near yonder copse, where once the garden smiled, And still where many a garden flower grows wild ; There, where a few torn shrubs the place disclose, The village preacher's modest mansion rose. A man he was to all the country dear, And passing rich with forty pounds a year ; Remote from towns he ran his godly race, Nor e'er had changed, nor wish'd to change, his place ; Unpractised he to fawn, or seek for power, By doctrines fashion'd to the varying hour ; Far other aims his heart had leam'd to prize, More skill'd to raise the wretched than to rise. His house was known to all the vagrant train, He chid their wanderings, but relieved their pain. The long remember'd beggar was his guest, Whose beard descending swept his aged breast ; The ruin'd spendthrift, now no longer proud, Claim'd kindred there, and had his claims allow'd ; The broken soldier, kindly bade to stay, Sate by his sire, and talk'd the night away ; Wept o'er his wounds, or tales of sorrow done, Shoulder'd his crutch, and show'd how fields were won. Pleased with his guests, the good man learn'd to glow, And quite forgot their vices in their woe ; Careless their merits or their faults to scan, His pity gave ere charity began. Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride, And e'en his failings lean'd to virtue's side ; But in his duty prompt at every call, He watch'd and wept, he pray'd and felt, for all."], [164, "150 DESCRIPTIVE pieces. And, as a bird each fond endearment tries To tempt its new-fledged offspring to the skies, He tried each art, reproved each dull delay, Allured to brighter worlds, and led the way. Beside the bed where parting life was laid, And sorrow, guilt, and pain, by turns dismay'd, The reverend champion stood. At his control, Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul ; Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise, And his last faltering accents whisper'd praise. At church, with meek and unaffected grace, His looks adorn'd the venerable place ; Truth from his lips prevail'd with double sway, And fools, who came to scoff, remain'd to pray. The service pass'd, around the pious man, With ready zeal, each honest rustic ran ; E'en children follow'd with endearing wile, And pluck'd his gown, to share the good man's smile. His ready smile a parent's warmth express'd, Their welfare pleased him, and their cares distress'd ; To them his heart, his love, his griefs were given, But all his serious thoughts had rest in heaven.

Forced by soft violence of prayer, The blithsome goddess soothes my care ; I feel the deity inspire, And thus she models my desire.

Thus shelter'd, free from care and strife. May I enjoy a calm through life ; See faction, safe in low degree, As men at land view storms at sea, And laugh at miserable elves, Not kind, so much as to themselves, Cursed with such souls of base alloy, As can possess, but not enjoy; Debarr'd the pleasure to impart, By avarice, sphincter of the heart., Who wealth, hard earn'd by guilty cares, Bequeath untouch'd to thankless heirs."], [169, "155 descriptive pieces.

Over mead and over wood, From house to house, from hill to hill, Till contemplation had her fill. About his chequer'd sides I wind, And leave his brooks and meads behind, And groves and grottos where I lay*, And vistas shooting beams of day : Wider and wider spreads the vale, As circles on a smooth canal ; The mountains round, unhappy fate ! Sooner or later, of all height, Withdraw their summits from the skies, And lessen as the others rise ; Still the prospect wider spreads, Adds a thousand woods and meads, Still it widens, widens still, And sinks the newly-risen hill.

No clouds, no vapours intervene, But the gay, the open scene Does the face of nature show In all the hues of heaven's bow !"], [171, "157 descriptive pieces.

Rushing from the woods, the spires Seem from hence ascending fires ! Half his beams Apollo sheds On the yellow mountain-heads ! Gilds the fleeces of the flocks, And glitters on the broken rocks ! Below me trees unnumber'd rise, Beautiful in various dyes : The gloomy pine, the poplar blue, The yellow beech, the sable yew, The slender fir, that taper grows, The sturdy oak, with broad- spread boughs, And beyond, the purple grove, Haunt of Phillis, queen of love ! Gaudy as the opening dawn, Lies a long and level lawn, On which a dark hill, steep and high, Holds and charms the wandering eye ; Deep are his feet in Towy's flood, His sides are clothed with waving wood, And ancient towers crown his brow, That cast an awful look below : Whose ragged walls the ivy creeps, And with her arms from falling keeps ; So both a safety from the wind On mutual dependence find.

And see the rivers how they run, Thro' woods and meads, in shade and sun Sometimes swift, sometimes slow, Wave succeeding wave, they go A various journey to the deep, Like human life to endless sleep ! Thus is nature's vesture wrought, To instruct our wandering thought ; Thus she dresses green and gay, To disperse our cares away. Ever charming, ever new, When will the landscape tire the view ! The fountain's fall, the river's flow, The woody valleys, warm and low ; The windy summit, wild and high, Roughly rushing on the sky ; The pleasant seat, the ruin'd tower, The naked rock, the shady bower ; The town and village, dome and farm, Each give each a double charm, As pearls upon an \u00c6thiop's arm.

Oh, may I with myself agree, And never covet what I see ! Content me with an humble shade, My passions tamed, my wishes laid, For while our wishes wildly roll, We banish quiet from the soul ; 'Tis thus the busy beat the air, And misers gather wealth and care. Now, e'en now, my joys run high, As on the mountain-turf I lie ; While the wanton Zephyr sings, And in the vale perfumes his wings ; While the waters murmur deep ; While the shepherd charms his sheep ; While the birds unbounded fly, And with music fill the sky, Now, e'en now, my joys run high.

The curfew tolls the knell of parting day, The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea, The ploughman homeward plods his weary way, And leaves the world to darkness and to me. Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight, And all the air a solemn stillness holds, Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight, And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds ; Save that from yonder ivy-mantled tower, The moping owl does to the moon complain Of such as, wandering near her secret bower, Molest her ancient solitary reign. Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade, Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap, Each in his narrow cell for ever laid, The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep. The breezy call of incense-breathing morn, The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed, The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn, No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed. For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn, Or busy housewife ply her evening care : No children run to lisp their sire's return, Or climb his knees the envied bliss to share.

How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke !"], [180, "166 DESCRIPTIVE PIECES.

Nor you, ye proud, impute to these the fault, If Memory o'er their tomb no trophies raise, WThere thro' the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault, The peeling anthem swells the note of praise. Can storied urn or animated bust, Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath ? Can honour's voice provoke the silent dust, Or flattery soothe the dull cold ear of Death? Perhaps in this neglected spot is laid Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire ; Hands, that the rod of empire might have sway'd, Or waked to ecstacy the living lyre. But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page Rich with the spoils of Time did ne'er unroll ; Chill Penury repress'd then noble rage, And froze the genial current of the soul. Full many a gem of purest ray serene, The dark unfathom'd caves of Ocean bear : Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, And waste its sweetness on the desert air.

Here callow chiefs and embryo statesmen lie, And unfledged poets short excursions try : While Mersey's gentle current, which, too long By fame neglected and unknown to song, Between his rushy banks (no poet's theme) Had crept inglorious, like a vulgar stream, Reflects the ascending seats with conscious pride, And dares to emulate a classic tide.

Beneath his willows rove th' inquiring youth, And court the fair majestic form of truth.

All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players ; They have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts : His acts being seven ages. At first the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms ; And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel, And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. And then the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad"], [205, "191 DESCRIPTIVE PIECES. Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier, Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard, Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel ; Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice, In fair round belly, with good capon lined, With eyes severe and beard of formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances, And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon, With spectacles on nose, and pouch on side ; His youthful hose well saved, a world too wide For his shrunk shank ; and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble, pipes, And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all, That ends this strange eventful history, Is second childishness and mere oblivion, Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything. Shakespeare. CHAPTER XIX.

Alas ! poor Richard, where rides he the while 1 York. As in a theatre, the eyes of men, After a well-graced actor leaves the stage, Are idly bent on him that enters next, Thinking his prattle to be tedious : Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes Did scowl on Richard ; no man cried, God save him ! No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home : But dust was thrown upon his sacred head ; Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off (His face still combating with tears and smdes, The badges of his grief and patience), That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted, And barbarism itself have pitied him. But Heaven hath a hand in these events, To whose high will we bound our calm contents. Shakespeare,"], [207, "DESCRIPTIVE PIECES. 193 CHAPTER XX. hotspur's description of a fop. I remember, when the fight was done, When I was dry with rage, and extreme toil, Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword ; Came there a certain lord, neat, trimly dress'd ; Fresh as a bridegroom, and his chin new reap'd, Showed like a stubble land at harvest home. He was perfumed like a milliner ; And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held A pouncetrbox, which ever and anon He gave his nose, and took 't away again ; Who therewith angry, when it next came there, Took it in snuff. \u2014 And still he smiled and talk'd ; And as the soldiers bare dead bodies by, He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly, To bring a slovenly, unhandsome corse Betwixt the wind and his nobility.

I have pass'd a miserable night, \u2014 So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams, That, as I am a Christian faithful man, I would not spend another such a night, Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days ; So full of dismal terror was the time. Brak. What was your dream, my Lord ? I pray tell me. Clar. Methought that I had broken from the tow'r, And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy, And in my company my brother Glo'ster ; Who from my cabin tempted me to walk Upon the hatches. Thence we look'd tow'rd England, And cited up a thousand heavy times, During the wars of York and Lancaster, That had befall'n us. As we pass'd along Upon the giddy footing of the hatches, Methought that Glo'ster stumbled, and in falling Struck me (that sought to stay him) overboard, Into the tumbling billows of the main."], [209, "descriptive pieces. 195 Lord, Lord, methought what pain it was to drown ! What dreadful noise of waters in my ears ! What sights of ugly death within mine eyes ! I thought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks ; A thousand men, that fishes gnaw'd upon ; Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl, Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels ; Some lay in dead men's sculls ; and in those holes Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept, As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems, That woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep, And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by. Brak. Had you such leisure in the time of death, To gaze upon the secrets of the deep ? Clar. Methought I had ; and often did I strive To yield the ghost ; but still the envious flood Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth To find the empty, vast, and wand'ring air ; But smother' d it within my panting bulk, Which almost burst to belch it in the sea. Brak. Awak'd you not with this sore agony ? Clar. No, no ; my dream was lengthen'd after life ; 0 then began the tempest to my soul : I pass'd methought the melancholy flood, With that grim ferryman which poets write of, Unto the kingdom of perpetual night. The first that there did greet my stranger-soul, Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick, Who cry'd aloud \u2014 \"What scourge for perjury Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence ? \" And so 1 e vanished. Then came wandering by A shadow like an angel, with bright hair Dabbled in blood, and he shriek'd out aloud \u2014 \" Clarence is come ; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence, That stabbed me in the field by Tewkesbury ; k 2"], [210, "196 DESCRIPTIVE pieces. Seize on him, furies, take him to your torment3 V With that, methought a legion of foul fiends Inviron'd me, and howled in mine ears Such hideous cries, that with the very noise I trembling waked ; and for a season after Could not believe but that I was in hell ; Such terrible impression made my dream. Brak. No marvel, Lord, that it affrighted you ; I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it. Clar. Ah, Brakenbury ! I have done those things That now give evidence against my soul, For Edward's sake ; and see how he requites me ! O God ! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee, But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds, Yet execute thy wrath on me alone ; O spare my guiltless wife, and my poor children ! I pr'ythee, Brakenbury, stay by me ; My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep. Shakespeare. CHAPTER XXII. QUEEN MAB. 0 then I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fancy's midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agait-stone On the fore finger of an alderman ; Drawn with a team of little atomies, Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep ; Her waggon spokes made of long spinners' legs ; The cover of the wings of grasshoppers ; The traces of the smallest spider's web ; The collars of the moonshine's watery beams ; Her whip of cricket's bone ; the lash of film ;"], [211, "DESCRIPTIVE PIECES. 197 Her waggoner a small grey-coated gnat, Not half so big as a round little worm, Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid. Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut, Made by the joiner squirrel, or old grub, Time out of mind the fairies' coachmakers. And in this state she gallops, night by night, Through lover's brains, and then they dream of love On courtiers' knees, that dream on curtsies strait ; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees ; O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream ; Sometimes she gallops o'er a courtier's nose, And then dreams he of smelling out a suit : And sometimes comes she with a tithe-pig's tail, Tickling the parson as he lies asleep : Then dreams he of another benefice. Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then he dreams of cutting foreign throats, Of breaches, ambuscades, and Spanish blades, Of healths five fathom deep ; and then anon Drums in his ears, at which he starts and wakes ; And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two, And sleeps again. Shakespeare. CHAPTER XXIII. APOTHECARY. I do remember an apothecary, And hereabouts he dwells, whom late I noted In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows, Culling of simples ; meagre were his looks ; Sharp misery had worn him to the bones ; And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,"], [212, "198 DESCRIPTIVE PIECES. An alligator stuffd, and other skins Of Ul-shaped fishes ; and about his shelves A beggarly account of empty boxes ; Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds, Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses Were thinly scatter'd to make up a show. Noting this penury, to myself I said, An' if a man did need a poison now, Whose sale is present death in Mantua, Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him. Oh, this same thought did but forerun my need, And this same needy man must sell it me. As I remember, this should be the house. Shakespeare. CHAPTER XXIV. GREATNESS. Say, why was man so eminently raised Amid the vast creation ; why ordain'd Through life and death to dart his piercing eye, With thoughts beyond the limits of his frame ; But that the Omnipotent might send him forth In sight of mortal and immortal powers As on a boundless theatre, to run The great career of justice ? to exalt His generous aim to all diviner deeds ; To chase each partial purpose from his breast ; And through the mists of passion and of sense, Aud through the tossing tide of chance and pain, To hold his course unfaultering, while the voice Of truth and virtue, up the steep ascent Of nature, calls him to his high reward,"], [213, "DESCRIPTIVE PIECES. 199 Th' applauding smile of He \u201even : Else wherefore burns In mortal bosoms this unquenched hope, That breathes from day to day sublimer things, And mocks possession ? Wherefore darts the mind, With such resistless ardour to embrace Majestic forms ; impatient to be free, Spurning the gross control of wilful might ; Proud of the strong contention of her toils ; Proud to be daring ? Who but rather turns To Heaven's broad fire this unconstrained view, Than to the glimmering of a waxen flame ? Who that, from Alpine heights, his labouring eye Shoots round the wild horizon, to survey Nilus or Ganges rolling his bright wave Through mountains, plains, through empires black with shade And continents of sand ! will turn his gaze To mark the windings of a scanty rill That murmurs at his feet ? the high-born soul Disdains to rest her heaven-aspiring wing Beneath its native quarry. Tired of earth And this diurnal scene, she springs aloft Through fields of air : pursues the flying storm : Rides on the volley'd lightning through the heavens ; Or yoked with whirlwinds and the northern blast, Sweeps the long tract of day. Then high she soars The blue profound, and hovering round the sun Beholds him pouring the redundant stream Of light ; beholds his unrelenting sway Bend the reluctant planets to absolve The fated rounds of time. Thence far effused She darts her swiftness up the long career ' Of devious comets ; through its burning signs Exulting measures the perennial wheel Of nature, and looks back on all the stars, Whose blended light, as with a milky zone,"], [214, "200 DESCRIPTIVE PIECES. Invests the orient. Now amazed she views Th' empyreal waste, where happy spirits hold, Beyond this concave heaven, their calm abode ; And fields of radiance, whose unfading hght Has travelled the profound six thousand years, Nor yet arrives in sight of mortal things. Even on the barriers of the world untired She meditates th' eternal depth below ; Till, half recoiling, down the headlong steep She plunges ; soon o'erwhelm'd and swallow'd up In that immense of being. There her hopes Rest at the fatal goal. For from the birth Of mortal man, the sovereign Maker said, That not in humble nor in brief delight, Nor in the fading echoes of renown, Power's purple robes, nor pleasure's flowery lap, The soul should find enjoyment : but from these Turning disdainful to an equal good, Through all the ascent of things enlarge her view, Till every bound at length should disappear, And infinite perfection close the scene. Akenside. CHAPTER XXV THE INSUFFICIENCY OF WORLDLY PURSUITS TO PROCURE HAPPINESS : AN ODE. Me miserum, quid agam?

God of my senses, Pleasure, deign To write me foremost of the train Who chief have sought thy genial dower ; Nor dared I worship at thy throne Were not thy favourite pleas my own. Beauty, and youth, aud health's enlivening power, Shed all thy fragrance on my flowing hair, Bind ivy, bind the myrtle on my brow \u2014 Another Helen shall become my fair, And Bacchus on his slave his proudest palms bestow. Let, then, a thousand tapers pour Their glories on the wanton hour ; Let Music all her charms employ, To smooth the step of gay desire, And elevate the lover's fire, And bind the melting soul in bands of joy. k 3"], [216, "202 DESCRIPTIVE PIECES. But, ah ! soft syrens, to my manly mind A nobler instinct points a loftier aim, Since Age shall come, nor Death be far behind, When Pleasure's power is past, and Hope's one prize is Fame He wins not Fame, whose deedless day On downy pinions fleets away ; 'Tis earned alone by toils severe \u2014 And sure, my soul, this Fame implies Thy dearest bliss, thy grandest prize. Hark ! her fine p\u00e6an, warbling in mine ear, Swells all my powers, and such a force bestows, That o'er the droning myriads, seated high, The vulgar joys I scorn, the vulgar woes, Dread not the damps of Age, and Death himself defy. But Fame, are all these blessings thine, When, whilst I live, thou art not mine ? Yet dying, \u2014 if my name but lives, \u2014 Thy servants sure are vilely paid, Thou vapouring shadow of a shade, A splendid promiser that nothing gives, Yet at the price of many a solid pain, That specious nothing we with pride pursue, War all our days for unsubstantial gain, Nor oft, wheu dead, acquire our earn'd and useless due. But in this dark and down-sunk age, When Glory's fire has spent its rage, And scarce a lingering sparkle gleams \u2014 Were it not better I should aim, One of the crowd, at common game, And bid farewell to Fame's fantastic dreams ? Then take me, Wealth, all worshipp'd, for your own \u2014 Let me by prudent arts your grace obtain \u2014 Appoint me nearest to your potent throne \u2014 And let me bear the rod which opes the springs of Cain."], [217, "203 DESCRIPTIVE PIECES.

Oh ! taste this nectar'd draught of sacred joys ; This draught of gods shall godlike man refuse ? This cup for ever full \u2014 this sweet that never cloys. This potent draught the gods can bear, But men, too weak their bliss to share, The maddening cup attempt to drain ; And Wisdom, ill-pursued, but shows From Art what branching Folly grows : Gorgons, and hydras, and chimeras vain, And spectres dire to terrify mankind. Better rade Nature, in her rudest form, Than truth oft sought till dizzy Wit grows blind, Or mining Atheism plays his desolating storm. From man, what ills must man endure ? How shall I then my peace secure ? 0 Power, I'll seek thy force divine, On earth commence the demi-god, Wide-wielding Terror's torturing rod, And solely claim the general rights for mine. But thus I rather shall the brute assume, For peace 'mid lurking vengeance vainly try, And ever conscious of my coming doom, Dreading and dreaded live, and unlamented die.

It glistens not by Glory's fane, Nor laves the castled realm of Power, Nor sweetly streams by Pleasure's bower, Which wealth nor buys, nor Wisdom's arts obtain ; Yet Fancy, Custom, Nature, urge my soul To seek it still with unabating force, An impulse Reason dares not to control, But shakes the chiding rein, and spurs them to the course. Oh ! by the pangs that rend my heart, All-pitying Heaven some light impart, By which I may my bliss descry, And from the waves on which I roll From the dark storms that shake my soul, Glance on the glittering scene my raptured eye. Oh ! ere my glowing life-blood cease to run, Give me to gain awhile my heart's desire; Ere Death's grim shade arise, reveal my sun, That, basking in its blaze, I may with joy expire. - Fond wretch, reproving Reason cries, Ere man's completely blest, he dies. Nor highest joy, nor deepest woe, Were meant to meet thy present state, Sure comes consummate bliss, tho' late ; Nor seek on earth what earth can ne'er bestow. Let calm-eyed Prudence all thy passions steer ; Thy moral sight let sacred Hope unclose ; And soon a heaven shall rise in prospect clear, And soon on earth Content thy throbbing heart compose. Curb then thy pride, ambitious man, And reverence God's superior plan ; Bid Wisdom moderate Fancy's fire, Aim not at perfect bliss on earth, Then whiter days shall dawn to birth ; Content shall mark the barriers to Desire,"], [219, "205 DESCRIPTIVE PIECES.

To wake the soul by tender strokes of art, To raise the genius, and to mend the heart, To make mankind in conscious virtue bold, Live o'er each scene, and be what they behold ; For this the Tragic Muse first trod the stage, Commanding tears to flow through every age ; Tyrants no more their savage nature kept, And foes to virtue wonder'd how they wept. Our author shuns by vulgar arts to move The Hero's glory or the Virgin's love ; In pitying love, we but our weakness show, And wild ambition well deserves its woe ; Here tears shall flow from a more generous cause, Such tears as patriots shed for dying laws ; He bids your breasts with ancient ardour rise, And calls forth Roman drops from British eyes. Virtue confess'd in human shape he draws, What Plato thought, and god-like Cato was. No common object to your sight displays, But what with pleasure Heaven itself surveys : A brave man struggling in the storms of fate, And greatly falling with a fallen state ! While Cato gives his little Senate laws, What bosom beats not in his country's cause ?"], [220, "206 DESCRIPTIVE PIECES. Who sees him act, but envies every deed ? Who hears him groan, and does not wish to bleed ? E'en when great C\u00e6sar, midst triumphal cars, The spoils of nations, and the pomp of wars, Ignobly vain and impotently great, Show'd Rome her Cato's figure drawn in state ; As her dead father's reverend image past, The pomp was darken'd and the day o'ercast, The triumph ceased \u2014 tears gush'd from every eye, The world's great victor pass'd unheeded by ; Her last good man dejected Rome adored, And honour'd C\u00e6sar's less than Cato's sword. Britons attend : be worth like this approved, And show you have the virtue to be moved. Pope. CHAPTER XXVII. EPILOGUE TO SEMIRAMIS. Dishea'elled still like Asia's bleeding queen, Shall I with jests deride the tragic scene ? No, beauteous mourners ! from whose down-cast eyes, The Muse has drawn her noblest sacrifice ! Whose gentle bosoms, \u2014 Pity's altars, \u2014 bear The crystal incense of each falling tear ! There lives the poet's praise ! no critic art Can match the comment of a feeling heart. When general plaudits speak the fable o'er, Which mute attention had approved before, Tho' ruder spirits love th' accustom'd jest, Which chases sorrow from the vulgar breast, Still hearts refined their sadden'd tints retain \u2014 The sigh is pleasure, and the jest is pain !"], [221, "descriptive pieces. 207 Scarce have they smiles to honour grace and wit, Tho' Roscius spoke the verse himself had writ. Thus thro' the time when vernal fruits receive The grateful showers, that hang on April's eve, \u2014 Tho' every coarser stem of forest birth Throws with the morning-beam its dews to earth \u2014 Ne'er does the gentle rose revive so soon, But, bathed in Nature's tears, it droops till noon. Oh, could the Muse one simple moral teach From scenes like these, which all who heard might reach ! Thou child of sympathy \u2014 whoe'er thou art, Who with Assyria's queen hast wept thy part \u2014 Go search where keener woes demand relief, Go \u2014 while thy heart yet beats with fancied grief; Thy hp still conscious of the recent sigh, The graceful tear still lingering in thy eye \u2014 Go \u2014 and on real misery bestow The blest effusion of fictitious woe \u2014 So shall our Muse, supreme of all the nine, Deserve indeed the title of divine ! Virtue shall own her favour'd from above, And Pity greet her with a sister's love. Sheridan. CHAPTER XXVIII. EPILOGUE TO KING LEAR. As performed at Reading School. What could Cordelia do, \u2014 her sisters known, Whose oily falsehood stole a father's throne ? Or what could Virtue say, when Cunning wrought The net of rhetoric, which a father caught ? A daughter, and a princess, she disdains To bind the Truth in Adulation's chains ;"], [222, "208 DESCRIPTIVE PIECES.

The blameless damsel tower'd above her fear, Flash'd forth disdain, but struck a marbled ear. Meek when her sire offended, she disdains Against his- foes to check Resentment's reins. But, ah ! in vain ; for when the human mind By selfishness, that chilling asp, is twined, Nature's dear charities are felt no more, And floods of tears but dash a stony shore. Thanks to the mighty Master's touching page, His lovely morals, and his generous rage, Honour's bright spirit darting all its fire At clouds of Vice, that black from Hell aspire, From whose detested horrors, we repose In Kent's firm faith, in gentle Edgar's woes ; In Lear taught pity by th' uupitying wind, And yearning for his child, too late, alas ! thought kind. From man, the keen-eyed Shakespeare knew to glean All Passion's conflict from his tragic scene ; But Heaven alone the fancy could bestow, By which he deepened the dark dyes of woe ; Through mimicked Folly heightened tears by smiles, And bade the Truth glare out from Phrenzy's wiles ! Nor hurl'd abroad his thunder-storm in vain, The sheeted lightning, and the pelting rain, To teach us, spite of fourscore years and more, And the bright crown the worshipp'd king once wore, That Lear from all these horrors found relief, Beneath the rackings of a fiercer grief. You generous Britons ! our unpractised age, When it sought morals from life's glass \u2014 the stage,"], [223, "DESCRIPTIVE PIECES. 209 Was taught from Hamlet's* filial worth, to draw, From sweet Cordelia's, youth's superior law ; That sense of filial duty, which combined With all the requisites of cultured mind, Gives to green years a modesty, to guide Our vessel safe on youth's tempestuous tide ; Whilst on the prow the Reverend Mentor stands, And cheers his pupil with applauding hands.

See, roused by rival chiefs of kingly line, In hostile combat kindred legions join : Each adverse baron, proud in martial might, Calls forth his hardy vassals to the fight !

Such are the woes we paint ; nor vainly deem Of sage instruction void th' historic theme ! Here all may view, by sad experience wise, Th' unnumbered ills, from doubtful rule that rise ; And learn the happier fate that nations own, Where, with just bounds, one monarch fills the throne Where, friend of right, and guardian of the law, The land's dread sovereign holds the realm in awe : Quells, ere it rages, Faction's maddening flame, Controls the proud, and checks Ambition's aim ; Protects the weak, alike o'er all presides, Restrains with vigour, and with wisdom guides ; The State still fixes to its wonted place, Each looser part concentering to its base ; With weight superior binds and settles all, And keeps the mighty fabric from its fall. Ah ! little deem'd, 0 France, thy fickle train, When lured to quit fair Duty's milder reign, Proud they gave up their once-loved Monarch's sway And saw him sink, to traitors' arms a prey; Saw on the murderous steel the life-blood start, Which warm came issuing from his patriot heart ; Ah ! little deem'd they, in that hour of fate, What woes then brooded o'er the sinking State.

How different now ! The Sister Nations claim One common cause in George and Britain's name, And jointly aiming in their Monarch's right, \" Are confident against the world \" in fight. Alas ! that on a kindred island's shore, With horrid yell Sedition's fiends should roar !

It was some time in the summer of that year in which Dendermond was taken by the allies, \u2014 which was about seven years before my father came into the country, \u2014 and about as many after the time that my uncle Toby and Trim had privately decamped from my father's house in town, in order to lay some of the finest sieges to some of the finest fortified cities in Europe \u2014 when my uncle Toby was one evening getting his supper, with Trim sitting behind him at a small sideboard ; \u2014 the landlord of a little inn in the village came into the parlour with an empty phial in his hand to beg a glass or two of sack. 'Tis for a poor gentle man \u2014 I think of the army, \u2014 said the landlord, who has been taken ill at my house four days ago, and has never held up his head since, or had a desire to taste anything till just now, that he has a fancy for a glass of sack and a thin toast, \u2014 I think, says he, taking his hand from his forehead, it would comfort me. If I could neither beg, borrow, nor buy such a thing \u2014 added the landlord\u2014 I would almost steal it for the poor gentleman, he is so ill. I hope in God he will still mend, \u2014 continued he, \u2014 we are all of us concerned for him."], [235, "PATHETIC PIECES. 221 Thou art a good-natured soul, I will answer for thee, cried my uncle Toby ; and thou shalt drink the poor gentleman's health in a glass of sack thyself, and take a couple of bottles with my service ; and tell him he is heartily welcome to them, and to a dozen more if they will do him good. Though I am persuaded, said my uncle Toby, as the land lord shut the door, he is a very compassionate fellow, Trim ; yet I cannot help entertaining a high opinion of his guest too : there must be something more than common in him, that in so short a time should win so much upon the affec tions of his host. And of his whole family, added the corporal : for they are all concerned for him. Step after him, said my uncle Toby \u2014 do Trim \u2014 and ask if he knows his name. I have quite forgot it truly, said the landlord, coming back into the parlour with the corporal ; but I can ask his son again. Has he a son with him, then ? said my uncle Toby. A boy, replied the landlord, of about eleven or twelve years of age ; but the poor creature has tasted almost as little as his father ; he does nothing but mourn and lament for him night and day. He has not stirred from the bedside these two days. My uncle Toby laid down his knife and fork, and thrust his plate from before him, as the landlord gave him the ac count ; and Trim, without being ordered, took away without saying one word, and in a few minutes after brought him his pipe and tobacco. Stay in the room a little, said my uncle Toby. \u2014 Trim, said my uncle Toby, after he lighted his pipe, and smoked about a dozen whiffs. Trim came in front of his master and made his bow, \u2014 my uncle Toby smoked on, and said no more. Corporal ! said my uncle Toby \u2014 the corporal made his bow. My uncle Toby proceeded no farther, but finished his pipe. Trim ! said my uncle Toby, I have a project in my head,"], [236, "222 PATHETIC PIECES. as it is a bad night, of wrapping myself up warm in my ro quelaure, and paying a visit to this poor gentleman. Your honour's roquelaure, replied the corporal, has not once been had on since the night before your honour received your wound, when we mounted guard in the trenches before the gate of St. Nicholas : and, besides, it is so cold and rainy a night, that what with the roquelaure, and what with the weather, 'twill be enough to give your honour your death, and bring on your honour's torment in your groin. I fear so, replied my uncle Toby ; but I am not at rest in my mind, Trim, since the account the landlord has given me. I wish I had not known so much of this affair, added my uncle Toby ; or that I had known more of it. How shall we manage it ? Leave it, an't please your honour, to me, quoth the corporal. I'll take my hat and stick, and go to the house and reconnoitre, and act accordingly ; and I will bring your honour a full account in an hour. Thou shalt go, Trim, said my uncle Toby ; and here's a shilling for thee to drink with his servant. I shall get it all out of him, said the corporal, shutting the door. My uncle Toby filled his second pipe ; and had it not been that he now and then wandered from the point, with considering whether it was not full as well to have the cur tain of the tennaile a straight line as a crooked one, he might be said to have thought of nothing else but poor Le Fevre and his boy the whole time he smoked it. It was not till my uncle Toby had knocked the ashes out of his third pipe, that corporal Trim returned from the inn, and gave him the following account : \u2014 I despaired at first, said the corporal, of being able to bring back your honour any kind of intelligence concerning the poor sick lieutenant. \u2014 Is he in the army, then, said my uncle Toby. \u2014 He is, said the corporal. \u2014 And in what regiment ? said my uncle Toby. \u2014 I'll tell your honour, replied the corporal, everything straightforwards as I learnt it. \u2014 Then,"], [237, "PATHETIC PIECES. 223 Trim, I'll fill another pipe, said my uncle Toby, and not interrupt thee tdl thou hast done ; so sit down at thy ease, Trim, in the window seat, and begin thy story again. The corporal made his old bow, which generally spoke as plain as a bow could speak it \u2014 \" Your honour is good.\" And having done that, he sat down as he was ordered, and began the story to my uncle Toby over again in pretty near the same words. I despaired at first, said the corporal, of being able to bring back any intelligence to your honour about the lieu tenant and his son ; for when I asked where his servant was, from whom I made myself sure of knowing everything which was proper to be asked. \u2014 That's a right distinction, Trim, said my uncle Toby. \u2014 I was answered, and please your honour, that he had no servant with him, \u2014 that he had come to the inn with hired horses, which, upon finding himself unable to proceed (to join, I suppose, the regiment), he had dismissed the morning after he came. If I get better, my dear, said he, as he gave his purse to his son to pay the man, we can hire horses from hence. But alas ! the poor gentleman will never get from hence, said the landlady to me, for I heard the death-watch all night long ; and when he dies, the youth his son wiU certainly die with him, for he is broken hearted already. I was hearing this account, continued the corporal, when the youth came into the kitchen to order the thin toast the landlord spoke of ; \u2014 but I will do it for my father myself, said the youth. Pray let me save you the trouble, young gentleman, said I, taking up a fork for the purpose, and offering him my chair to sit down upon by the fire, whilst I did it. I believe, sir, said he, very modestly, I can please him best myself. I am sure, said I, his honour will not like the toast the worse for being toasted by an old soldier. The youth took hold of my hand, and instantly burst into tears. \u2014 Poor youth, said my uncle Toby ; he has been bred up from"], [238, "224 PATHETIC PIECES. an infant in the army, and the name of a soldier, Trim, sounded in his ears like the name of a friend, \u2014 I wish I had him here. I never, in the longest march, said the corporal, had so great a mind to my dinner, as I had to cry with him for company : what could be the matter with me, an' please your honour ? \u2014 Nothing in the world, Trim, said my uncle Toby, blowing his nose, but that thou art a good-natured fellow. When I gave him the toast, continued the corporal, I thought it was proper to tell him I was Captain Shandy's servant, and that your honour (though a stranger) was ex tremely concerned for his father ; and that if there was anything in your house or cellar \u2014 (and thou might'st have added my purse, too, said my uncle Toby,) \u2014 he was heartily welcome to it. He made a very low bow (which was meant to your honour), but no answer ; for his heart was full \u2014 so he went up stairs with the toast. I warrant you, my dear, said I, as I opened the kitchen door, your father will be well again. Mr. Yorick's curate was smoking a pipe by the kitchen fire, but said not a word good or bad to comfort the youth. I thought it was wrong, added the corporal. \u2014 I think so too, said my uncle Toby. When the lieutenant had taken his glass of sack and toast, he felt himself a little revived, and sent down into the kitchen to let me know, that in about ten minutes he should be glad if I would step up stairs. I believe, said the land lord, he is going to say his prayers, for there was a book laid upon the chair by his bedside, and as I shut the door I saw his son take up a cushion. I thought, said the curate, that you gentlemen of the army, Mr. Trim, never said your prayers at all. I heard the poor gentleman say his prayers last night, said the landlady, very devoutly, and with my own ears, or I could not have believed it. Are you sure of it? replied the curate. A soldier, an' please your reverence, said I, prays as often of"], [239, "225 PATHETIC PIECES. his own accord as a parson ; and when he is fighting for his king, and for his own life, and for his honour too, he has the most reason to pray to God of anyone in the whole world. \u2014 'Twas well said of thee, Trim, said my uncle Toby \u2014But when a soldier, said I, an' please your reverence, has been standing for twelve hours together in the trenches, up to his knees in cold water, or engaged, said I, for months to gether in long and dangerous marches, \u2014 harassed, perhaps, in his rear to-day, harassing others to-morrow, \u2014 detached here, countermanded there, \u2014 resting this night out upon his arms, beat up in his shirt the next, \u2014 benumbed in his joints, \u2014 perhaps without straw in his tent to kneel on, \u2014 he must say his prayers how and when he can. I believe said I, \u2014 for I was piqued, quoth the corporal, for the reputation of the army, \u2014 I believe, an' please your reverence, said I, that when a soldier gets time to pray, he prays as heartily as a parson, though not with all his fuss and hypocrisy. \u2014 Thou shouldst not have said that, Trim, said my uncle Toby, for God only knows who is a hypocrite and who is not. At the great and general review of us all, corporal, at the day of judgment (and not till then) it will be seen who has done their duties in this world and who has not ; and we shad be advanced, Trim, accordingly. \u2014 I hope we shall, said Trim. \u2014 It is in the Scripture, said my uncle Toby ; and I will show it thee to-morrow. In the meantime, we may depend upon it, Trim, for our comfort, said my uncle Toby, that God Almighty is so good and just a governor of the world, that if we have but done our duties in it, it will never be inquired into, whether we have per formed them in a red coat or a black one. \u2014 I hope not, said the corporal.\u2014 But go on, Trim, said my uncle Toby, with thy story. When I went up, continued the corporal, into the lieu tenant's room, which I did not do till the expiration of the ten minutes, he was lying in his bed with his head raised upon his hand, with his elbow upon the pillow, and a clean l 3"], [240, "226 PATHETIC PIECES. white cambric handkerchief beside it. The youth was just stooping down to take up the cushion, upon which I supposed he had been kneeling \u2014 the book was laid upon the bed, \u2014 and as he rose, in taking up the cushion with one hand, he reached out his other to take it away at the same time. Let it remain there, my dear, said the lieutenant. He did not offer to speak to me till I had walked up close to his bed-side. If you are Captain Shandy's servant, said he, you must present my thanks to your master, with my little boy's thanks along with them, for his courtesy to me ; if he was of Leven's said the lieutenant, \u2014 I told him your honour was, \u2014 then, said he, I served three campaigns with him in Flanders, and remember him ; but 'tis most likely, as I had not the honour of any acquaintance with him, that he knows nothing of me. You will tell him, however, that the person his good nature has laid under obligations to him, is one Le Fevre, a lieutenant in Angus's- \u2014 but he knows me not, said he a second time, musing; possibly he may my story, added he : pray tell the captain, I was the ensign at Breda, whose wife was most unfortunately killed with a musket shot, as she lay in my arms in my tent. \u2014 I remember the story, an't please your honour, said I, very well. Do you so ? said he, wiping his eyes with his handkerchief, then well may I. In saying this, he drew a little ring out of his bosom, which seemed tied with a black riband about his neck, and kissed it twice. Here, Billy, said he, \u2014 the boy flew across the room to the bed-side, \u2014 and, falling down upon his knee, took the ring in his hand and kissed it too ; then kissed his father, and sat down upon the bed and wept. I wish, said my uncle Toby, with a deep sigh \u2014 I wish, Trim, I was asleep. Your honour, replied the corporal, is too much concerned ; shall I pour your honour out a glass of sack to your pipe ? \u2014 Do, Trim, said my uncle Toby."], [241, "PATHETIC PIECES. 227 I remember, said my uncle Toby, sighing again, the story of the ensign and his wife, with a circumstance his modesty omitted ; and particularly well that he, as well as she, upon some account or other (I forget what), was universally pitied by the whole regiment. But finish the story thou art upon. \u2014 'Tis finished already, said the corporal, for I could stay no longer, so wished his honour a good night. Young Le Fevre rose from off the bed, and saw me to the bottom ofthe stairs ; and as we went down together, told me they had come from Ireland, and were on their route to join the regiment in Flanders. But, alas ! said the corporal, the lieutenant's last day's march is over. \u2014 Then what is to become of his poor boy ? cried my uncle Toby. It was to my uncle Toby's eternal honour \u2014 though I tell it only for the sake of those who, when cooped in betwixt a natural and a positive law, know not for their souls which way in the world to turn themselves \u2014 that notwithstanding my uncle Toby was warmly engaged at that time in carry ing on the siege of Dendermond, parallel with the allies, who pressed theirs on so vigorously that they scarce allowed him time to get his dinner ; that nevertheless he gave up Dendermond, though he had already made a lodgment upon the counterscarp, and bent his whole thoughts towards the private distresses at the inn ; and except that he ordered the garden-gate to be bolted up, by which he might be said to have turned the siege of Dendermond into a blockade, he left Dendermond to itself, to be relieved or not by the French king, as the French king thought good ; and only considered how he himself should relieve the poor lieutenant and his son. That kind Being, who is a friend to the friendless, shaU recompense thee for this. Thou hast left this matter short, said my uncle Toby to the corporal, as he was putting him to bed, and I will tell thee in what, Trim. In the first place, when thou madest"], [242, "228 PATHETIC PIECES. an offer of my services to Le Fevre, as sickness and travelling are both expensive, and thou knowest he was but a poor lieu tenant, with a son to subsist as well as himself, out of his pay \u2014 that thou didst not make an offer to him of my purse ; because, had he stood in need, thou knowest, Trim, he had been as welcome to it as myself. \u2014 Your honour knows, said the corporal, I had no orders. \u2014 True, quoth my uncle Toby, thou didst very right, Trim, as a soldier, but certainly very wrong as a man. In the second place, for which, indeed, thou hast the same excuse, continued my uncle Toby, when thou offeredst him whatever was in my house, thou shouldst have offered him my house too. A sick brother officer should have the best quarters, Trim ; and if we had him with us, we could tend and look to him. Thou art an excellent nurse, thyself, Trim, and what with thy care of him, and the old woman's and his boy's, and mine together, we might recruit him again at once, and set him upon his legs. In a fortnight or three weeks, added my uncle Toby, smiling, he might march.\u2014 He will never march, an' please your honour, in this world, said the corporal. \u2014 He wiU march, said my uncle Toby, rising up from the side of the bed, with one shoe off. \u2014 An' please your honour, said the corporal, he will never march but to his grave. \u2014 He shall march, cried my uncle Toby, marching the foot which had a shoe on, though without advancing an inch ; he shall march to his regiment. \u2014 He cannot stand it, said the corporal. \u2014 He shall be supported, said my uncle Toby. \u2014 He'll drop at last, said the corporal, and what will become of his boy ? \u2014 He shall not drop, said my uncle Toby, firmly. \u2014 A-well-o'day ; do what we can for him, said Trim, maintaining his point, the poor soul will die. \u2014 He shall not die, by G , cried my uncle Toby. The accusing spirit which flew up to heaven's chancery with the oath, blushed as he gave it in ; and the recording"], [243, "229 PATHETIC PIECES. angel, as he wrote it down, dropped a tear upon the word, and blotted it out for ever. My uncle Toby went to his bureau, put his purse into his breeches pocket, and having ordered the corporal to go early in the morning for a physician, he went to bed and fell asleep. The sun looked bright the morning after to every eye in the village but Le Fevre's and his afflicted son's ; the hand of death pressed heavy upon his eyelids \u2014 and hardly could the wheel at the cistern turn round its circle \u2014 when my uncle Toby, who had rose up an hour before his wonted time, entered the lieutenant's room, and without preface or apo logy sat himself down upon the chair by the bedside, and independently of all modes and customs opened the curtain in the manner an old friend and brother officer would have done it, and asked him how he did \u2014 how he had rested in the night \u2014 what was his complaint \u2014 where was his pain \u2014 and what he could do to help him ? \u2014 and without giving him time to answer any one of his inquiries, went on and told him of the little plan which he had been concerting with the corporal the night before for him. You shall go home directly, Le Fevre, said my uncle Toby, to my house, \u2014 and we'd send for a doctor to see what's the matter \u2014 and we'll have an apothecary \u2014 and the corporal shall be your nurse ; and I'd be your servant, Le Fevre. There was a frankness in my uncle Toby, \u2014 not the effect of familiarity, but the cause of it, \u2014 which let you at once into his soul, and showed you the goodness of his nature ; to this, there was something in his looks, and voice, and man ner, superadded, which eternally beckoned to the unfortu nate to come and take shelter under him ; so that, before my uncle Toby had half finished the kind offers he was making to the father, the son had insensibly pressed up close to his knees, and had taken hold of the breast of his coat, and"], [244, "230 PATHETIC PIECES. was pulling it towards him. The blood and spirits of Le Fevre, which were waxing cold and slow within him, and were retreating to their last citadel the heart, \u2014 rallied back, the film forsook his eyes for a moment, he looked up wish fully in my uncle Toby's face, then cast a look upon his boy, and that ligament, fine as it was, was never broken. Nature instantly ebbed again, \u2014 the film returned to its place \u2014 the pulse fluttered \u2014 stopped \u2014 went on \u2014 throbbed \u2014 stopped again \u2014 moved \u2014 stopped \u2014 shall I go on ? \u2014 No. Sterne. CHAPTER II. yorick's death. A few hours before Yorick breathed his last, Eugenius stept in with an intent to take his last sight and last farewell of him. Upon his drawing Yorick's curtain, and asking how he felt himself, Yorick looking up in his face, took hold of his hand, and after thanking him for the many tokens of his friendship to him, for which, he said, if it was their fate to meet hereafter, he would thank him again and again, he told him he was within a few hours of giving his enemies the slip for ever. I hope not, answered Eugenius, with tears trickling down his cheeks, and with the tenderest tone that ever man spoke, \u2014 I hope not, Yorick, said he. Yorick replied, with a look up, and gentle squeeze of Eugenius's hand, \u2014 and that was all, \u2014 but it cut Eugenius to the heart. Come, come, Yorick, quoth Eugenius, wiping his eyes and sum moning up the man within him, my dear lad, be comforted ; let not ad thy spirits and fortitude forsake thee at this crisis when thou most wantest them ; who knows what re sources are in store, and what the power of God may yet do for thee ? Yorick laid his hand upon his heart, and gently shook his head. For my part, continued Eugenius, crying"], [245, "231 PATHETIC PIECES. bitterly as he uttered the words, I declare I know not, Yorick, how to part with thee ; and would gladly flatter my hopes, added Eugenius, cheering up his voice, that there is still enough left of thee to make a bishop, and that I may live to see it. \u2014 I beseech thee, Eugenius, quoth Yorick, taking off his nightcap as well as he could with his left hand \u2014 his right still being grasped close in that of Euge nius \u2014 I beseech thee to take a view of my head. \u2014 I see nothing that ails it, replied Eugenius. \u2014 Then alas ! my friend, said Yorick, let me tell you, that it is so bruised and mis-shapen with the blows which have been so unhand somely given me in the dark, that I might say with Sancho Panza, that shoidd I recover, and \" mitres thereupon be suf fered to rain down from heaven as thick as hail,\" not one of them would fit it. Yorick's last breath was hanging upon his trembling lips ready to depart as he uttered this, yet still it was uttered with something of a Cervantic tone ; and as he spoke it, Eugenius could perceive a stream of lambent fire lighted up for a moment in his eyes ; \u2014 faint picture of those flashes of his spirit, which (as Shakespeare said of his ancestor) were wont to set the table in a roar ! Eugenius was convinced from this that the heart of his friend was broken ; he squeezed his hand, and then walked softly out of the room, weeping as he walked. Yorick fol lowed Eugenius with his eyes to the door, \u2014 he then closed them, \u2014 and never opened them more. He lies buried in a corner of his churchyard, under a plain marble slab, which his friend Eugenius, by leave of his executors, laid upon his grave, with no more than these three words of inscription, serving both for his epitaph and elegy- Alas, poor YORICK !"], [246, "232 PATHETIC PIECES. Ten times a day has Yorick's ghost the consolation to hear his monumental inscription read over with such a variety of plaintive tones, as denote a general pity and esteem for him \u25a0 a footway crossing the churchyard close by his grave, \u2014 not a passenger goes by without stopping to cast a look upon it, and sighing as he walks on, \u2014 Alas, Poor YORICK ! Sterne. CHAPTER III. ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF AN UNFORTUNATE LADY. What beckoning ghost, along the moonlight shade, Invites my steps, and points to yonder glade 1 'Tis she ! \u2014 but why that bleeding bosom gored, Why dimly gleams the visionary sword ? Oh, ever beauteous, ever friendly ! tell, Is it in heaven a crime to love too well ? To bear too tender, or too firm a heart, To act a lover's or a Roman's part ? Is there no bright reversion in the sky, For those who greatly think, or bravely die ? Why bade ye else, ye powei*s ! her soul aspire Above the vulgar flight of low desire ? Ambition first sprung from your blest abodes ; The glorious fault of angels and of gods : Thence to their images on earth it flows, And in the breasts of kings and heroes glows. Most souls, 'tis true, but peep out once an age, Dull, sullen prisoners in the body's cage : Dim lights of life, that burn a length of years Useless, unseen, as lamps in sepulchres ; Like Eastern kings, a lazy state they keep, And close confined to their own palace, sleep."], [247, "PATHETIC PIECES. 233 From these perhaps (ere Nature bade her die) Fate snatch'd her early to the pitying sky. As into air the purer spirits flow, And separate from their kindred dregs below ; So flew the soul to its congenial place, Nor left one virtue to redeem her race. But thou, false guardian of a charge too good, Thou mean deserter of thy brother's blood ! See on these ruby lips the trembling breath, These cheeks, now fading at the blast of death ; Cold is that breast which warm'd the world before, And those love -darting eyes must roll no more. Thus, if Eternal Justice rules the ball, Thus shall your wives, and thus your children fall : On ad the line a sudden vengeance waits, And frequent hearses shall besiege your gates. There passengers shall stand, and pointing say (Whde the long funerals blacken all the way), Lo ! these were they, whose souls the furies steel'd, And cursed with hearts unknowing how to yield. Thus unlamented pass the proud away, The gaze of fools, and pageant of a day ! So perish all, whose breast ne'er learn'd to glow For others' good, or melt at others' woe. What can atone (0 ever injured shade !) Thy fate unpity'd, and thy rites unpaid ? No friend's complaint, no kind domestic tear, Pleased thy pale ghost, or graced thy mournful bier By foreign hands thy dying eyes were closed, By foreign hands thy decent limbs composed ; By foreign hands thy humble grave adorn'd, By strangers honour'd and by strangers mourn'd. What tho' no friends in sable weeds appear, Grieve for an hour, perhaps, then mourn a year,"], [248, "234 PATHETIC PIECES. And bear about the mockery of woe To midnight dances, and the public show ; What tho' no weeping loves thy ashes grace, Nor polish'd marble emulate thy face ; What tho' no sacred earth allow thee room, Nor hallow'd dirge be mutter'd o'er thy tomb ; Yet shall thy grave with rising flowers be drest, And the green turf lie lightly on thy breast : There shall the morn her earliest tears bestow, There the first roses of the year shall blow ; While angels with their silver wings o'ershade The ground, now sacred by thy reliques made. So peaceful rests, without a stone, a name, What once had beauty, titles, wealth, and fame. How loved, how honour'd once, avails thee not, To whom related, or by whom begot ; A heap of dust alone remains for thee, 'Tis all thou art, and all the proud shall be ! Poets themselves must fall, like those they sung, Deaf the praised ear, and mute the tuneful tongue. E'en he, whose soul now melts in mournful lays, Shall shortly want the generous tear he pays ; Then from his closing eyes thy form shall part, And the last pang shall tear thee from his heart ; Life's idle business at one gasp be o'er, The Muse forgot, and thou beloved no more ! Pope."], [249, "235 PATHETIC PIECES. 3 CHAPTER IV. THE PARTING OF HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE. Hector, this heard, return' d without delay, Swift thro' the town he trod his former way, Thro' streets of palaces, and walks of state ; And met the mourner at the Sc\u0153an gate. With haste to meet him sprung the joyful fair, His blameless wife, Action's wealthy heir : (Cilician Thebe great Aetion sway'd, And Hippoplacus' wide-extended shade) The nurse stood near, in whose embraces prest His only hope hung smiling at her breast, AVhom each soft charm and early grace adorn, Fair as the new-born star that gilds the morn. To this loved infant Hector gave the name Scamandrius, from Scamander's honoured stream Astyanax the Trojans call'd the boy, From his great father, the defence of Troy. Silent the warrior smiled, and pleased resign'd To tender passions all his mighty mind : His beauteous princess cast a mournful look ; Hung on his hand, and theu dejected spoke ; Her bosom labour 'd with a boding sigh, And the big tear stood trembling in her eye. Too daring prince ! ah, whither dost thou run 1 Ah, too forgetful of thy wife and son ! And think'st thou not how wretched we shall be, A widow I, an helpless orphan he ! For sure such courage length of life denies, ' And thou must fall, thy virtue's sacrifice. Greece in her single heroes strove in vain ; Now hosts oppose thee, and thou must be slain !"], [250, "236 PATHETIC PIECES. Oh, grant me, gods ! e'er Hector meets his doom, All I can ask of Heaven, an early tomb ! So shaU my days in one sad tenour run, And end with sorrows as they first begun. No parent now remains my grief to share, No father's aid, no mother's tender care. The fierce Achilles wrapt our walls in fire, Laid Thebe waste, and slew my warlike sire ! His fate compassion in the victor bred, Stern as he was, he yet revered the dead, His radiant arms preserved from hostile spod, And laid him decent on the funeral pile ; Then raised a mountain where his bones were burn'd The mountain nymphs the rural tomb adorn' d, Jove's silvan daughters bade their elms bestow A barren shade, and in his honour grow. By the same arm my seven brave brothers fell ; In one sad day beheld the gates of heU ; While the fat herds and snowy flocks they fed ; Amid their fields the hapless heroes bled ! My mother lived to bear the victor's bands, The queen of Hippoplacia's sylvan lands : Redeem'd too late, she scarce beheld again Her pleasing empire and her native plain, When, ah ! oppress'd by life-consuming woe, She fell a victim to Diana's bow. Yet while my Hector still survives, I see My father, mother, brethren, all, in thee : Alas ! my parents, brother, kindred, all Once more will perish, if my Hector fall. Thy wife, thy infant, in thy danger share : Oh, prove a husband's and a father's care ! That quarter most the skilful Greeks annoy Where yon wild fig-trees join the wad of Troy :"], [251, "PATHETIC PIECES. 237 Thou, from this tower defend th' important post ; There Agamemnon points his dreadful host, That pass Tydides, Ajax, strive to gain, And there the vengeful Spartan fires his train. Thrice our bold foes the fierce attack have given, Or led by hopes, or dictated from heaven. Let others in the field their arms employ, But stay my Hector here, and guard his Troy. The chief reply'd : That post shall be my care, Not that alone, but all the works of war. How would the sons of Troy, in arms renown'd, And Troy's proud dames, whose garments sweep the ground, Attaint the lustre of my former name, Should Hector basely quit the field of fame ! My early youth was bred to martial pains, My soul impels me to th' embattled plains : Let me be foremost to defend the throne, And guard my father's glories, and my own. Yet come it will, the day decreed by fates : (How my heart trembles while my tongue relates !) The day when thou, imperial Troy ! must bend, And see thy warriors fall, thy glories end. And yet no dire presage so wounds my mind, My mother's death, the ruin of my kind, Not Priam's hoary hairs defiled with gore, Not all my brothers gasping on the shore ; As thine, Andromache ! thy griefs I dread ; I see thee trembling, \u2014 weeping, \u2014 captive led ! Iu Argive looms our battles to design, And woes, of which so large a part was thine ! To bear the victor's hard commands, or bring The weight of waters from Hyperia's spring. There, while you groan beneath the load of life, They cry, Behold the mighty Hector's wife !"], [252, "238 PATHETIC PIECES. Some haughty Greek, who lives thy tears to see, Embitters all thy woes, by naming me. The thoughts of glory past, and present shame, A thousand griefs, shall waken at the name ! May I lie cold before that dreadful day, Press'd with a load of monumental clay ! Thy Hector, wrapt in everlasting sleep, Shall neither hear thee sigh, nor see thee weep. Thus having spoke, th' illustrious chief of Troy Stretch'd his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy. The babe clung crying to his nurse's breast, Scared at the dazzling helm, and nodding crest. With secret pleasure each fond parent smiled, And Hector hasted to relieve his child, The glittering splendours from his brows unbound, And placed the beaming helmet on the ground, Then kiss'd the child, and lifting high in air, Thus to the gods preferr'd a father's prayer : 0 thou, whose glory fills th' \u00e6thereal throne, And all ye deathless powers, protect my son ! Grant him, like me, to purchase just renown, To guard the Trojans, to defend the crown, Against his country's foes the war to wage, And rise the Hector of the future age! So when triumphant from successful toils Of heroes slain he bears the reeking spoils, Whole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim, And say, This chief transcends his father's fame : While pleased amidst the general shouts of Troy, His mother's conscious heart o'erflows with joy. He spoke, and fondly gazing on her charms, Restored the pleasing burthen to her arms. Soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid, Hush'd to repose, and with a smile survey'd."], [253, "239 PATHETIC PIECES. \u25a0\u00bb Homer. The troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear, She mingled with a smile a tender tear. The soften'd chief with kind compassion view'd, And dry'd the falling drops, and thus pursued. Andromache ! my soul's far better part, Why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart ? No hostile hand can antedate my doom, Till fate condemns me to the silent tomb. Fix'd is the term of all the race of earth ; And such the hard condition of our birth : No force can then resist, no flight can save, All sink alike, the fearful and the brave. No more \u2014 but hasten to thy tasks at home ; There guide the spindle, and direct the loom : Me glory summons to the martial scene, The field of combat is the sphere for men. Where heroes war, the foremost place I claim, The first in danger as the first in fame. Thus having said, the glorious chief resumes His towery helmet, dark with shading plumes. His princess parts with a prophetic sigh, Unwilling parts, and oft reverts her eye That stream'd at ev'ry look : then moving slow, Sought her own palace, and indulged her woe. There, while her tears deplored the godlike man Through all her train the soft infection ran, The pious maids their mingled sorrows shed, And mourn the living Hector as the dead.

What could be less, than to afford him praise, The easiest recompense, and pay him thanks ? How due ! yet all his good proved ill in me, And wrought but malice ; lifted up so high I 'sdain'd subjection, and thought one step higher Would set me highest, and in a moment quit The debt immense of endless gratitude, So burdensome, still paying, still to owe ; Forgetful what from him I still received ; And understood not that a grateful mind By owing owes not, but still pays, at once Indebted and discharged ; what burthen then Oh ! had his powerful destiny ordain'd Me some inferior angel, I had stood Then happy ; no unbounded hope had raised Ambition.

I have observed of late thy looks are fall'n, O'ercast with gloomy cares and discontent; Then tell me, Syphax, I conjure thee tell me, What are the thoughts that knit thy brow in frowns, And turn thine eyes thus coldly on thy prince ? Syph. 'Tis not my talent to conceal my thoughts, Or carry smiles and sunshine in my face, When discontent sits heavy at my heart : I have not yet so much the Roman in me. Jub. Why dost thou cast out such ungenerous terms Against the lords and sovereigns of the world ? Dost thou not see mankind fall down before them, And own the force of their superior virtue ? Is there a nation in the wilds of Afric, Amidst our barren rocks and burning sands That does not tremble at the Roman name ? Syph. Gods ! where's the worth that sets this people up Above your own Numidia's tawny sons ? Do they with tougher sinews bend the bow? Or flies the javelin swifter to its mark,"], [259, "PATHETIC PIECES. 245 Launch'd from the vigour of a Roman arm? Who like our active African instructs The fiery steed, and trains him to his hand ? Or guides in troops the embattled elephant, Loaden with war ? These, these are arts, my prince. In which your Zama does not stoop to Rome. Jub. These ad are virtues of a meaner rank, Perfections that are placed in bones and nerves. A Roman's soul is bent on higher views : To civdize the rude unpolish'd world, To lay it under the restraint of laws ; To make man mild, and sociable to man ; To cultivate the wild licentious savage With wisdom, discipdne, and liberal arts : Th' embellishments of life : virtues like these, Make human nature shine, reform the soul, And break our fierce barbarians into men. Syph. Patience, just Heavens ! \u2014 Excuse an old man's warmth. What are these wondrous civilizing arts, This Roman polish, and this smooth behaviour, That render man thus tractable and tame ? Are they not only to disguise our passions, To set our looks at variance with our thoughts, To check the starts and sallies of the soul, And break off all its commerce with the tongue ? In short, to change us into other creatures Than what our nature and the gods designed 1 Jub. To strike thee dumb : turn up thy eyes to Cato ! There may'st thou see to what a godlike height The Roman virtues lift up mortal man. While good, and just, and anxious for his friends, He's still severely bent against himself ; Renouncing sleep, and rest, and food, and ease, He strives with thirst and hunger, toil and heat :"], [260, "246 PATHETIC PIECES. L> And when his fortune sets before him all The pomps and pleasures that his soul can wish, His rigid virtue will accept of none. Syph. Believe me, prince, there's not an African That traverses our vast Numidian deserts In quest of prey, and lives upon his bow, But better practises these boasted virtues. Coarse are his meals, the fortune of the chase, Amidst the running stream he slakes his thirst, Toils all the day, and at th' approach of night On the first friendly bank he throws him down, Or rests his head upon a rock till morn : Then rises fresh, pursues his wonted game, And if the following day he chance to find A new repast, or an untasted spring, Blesses his stars, aud thinks it luxury. Jub. Thy prejudices, Syphax, won't discern What virtues grow from ignorance and choice, Nor how the hero differs from the brute. But grant that others could with equal glory Look down on pleasures, and the baits of sense ; Where shall we find the man that bears affliction, Great and majestic in his griefs, like Cato ? Heavens ! with what strength, what steadiness of mind. He triumphs in the midst of all his sufferings ! How does he rise against a load of woes, And thank the gods that threw the weight upon him ! Syph. 'Tis pride, rank pride, and haughtiness of soul I think the Romans call it stoicism. Had not your royal father thought so highly Of Roman virtue, and of Cato's cause, He had not fall'n by a slave's hand, inglorious : Nor would his slaughter'd army now have lain On Afric's sands disfigured with their wounds, To gorge the wolves and vultures of Numidia."], [261, "PATHETIC PIECES. 247 Jub. Why dost thou call my sorrows up afresh ? My father's name brings tears into mine eyes. Syph. Oh, that you'd profit by your father's ills ! Jub. What would'st thou have me do ? Syph. Abandon Cato. Jub. Syphax, I should be more than twice an orphan By such a loss. Syph. Ay, there's the tie that binds you ! You long to call him father. Marcia's charms Work in your heart unseen, and plead for Cato. No wonder you are deaf to all I say. Jub. Syphax, your zeal becomes importunate ; I've hitherto permitted it to rave, And talk at large ; but learn to keep it in, Lest it should take more freedom than I'll give it. Syph. Sir, your great father never used me thus. Alas ! he's dead ! but can you e'er forget The tender sorrows and the pangs of nature, The fond embraces, and repeated blessings, Which you drew from him in your last farewed ? Stdl must I cherish the dear, sad remembrance, At once to torture, and to please my soul. The good old king at parting wrang my hand, (His eyes brim full of tears) then sighing cried, Prithee be careful of my son ! \u2014 His grief Swell'd up so high, he could not utter more. Jub. Alas, the story melts away my soul, That best of fathers ! how shad I discharge The gratitude and duty which I owe him? Syph. By laying up his counsels in your heart. Jub. His counsels bade me yield to thy directions : Then, Syphax, chide me in severest terms, Vent all thy passion, and I'll stand its shock, Calm and unruffled as a summer sea, When not a breath of wind flies o'er its surface."], [262, "248 PATHETIC PIECES. i Syph. Alas, my prince, I'd guide you to your safety \\ Jub. I do believe thou would'st ; but tell me how. Syph. Fly from the fate that follows C\u00e6sar's foes. Jub. My father scorn'd to do it. Syph. And therefore died. Jub. Better to die ten thousand deaths, Than wound my honour. Syph. Rather say your love. Jub. Syphax, I've promised to preserve my temper : Why wilt thou urge me to confess a flame I long have stifled, and would fain conceal ? Syph. Believe me, prince, though hard to conquer love, 'Tis easy to divert and break its force : Absence might cure it, or a second mistress Light up another flame, and put out this. The glowing dames of Zama's royal court Have faces flush'd with more exalted charms ; The sun that rolls his chariot o'er their heads, Works up more fire and colour in their cheeks : Were you with these, my prince, you'd soon forget The pale, unripen'd beauties of the North. Jub. 'Tis not a set of features, or complexion, The tincture of a skin that I admire. Beauty soon grows familiar to the lover, Fades in his eye, and palls upon the sense. The virtuous Marcia towers above her sex : True, she is fair (oh, how divinely fair !), But still the lovely maid improves her charms, With inward greatness, unaffected wisdom, And sanctity of manners. Cato's soul Shines out in ev'rything she acts or speaks, While winning mildness and attractive smiles Dwell in her looks, and with becoming grace Soften the rigour of her father's virtues. Syph. How does your tongue grow wanton in her praise Cato."], [263, "249 PATHETIC pieces. CHAPTER VIIL cato's soliloquy. It must be so \u2014 Plato, thou reason'st well \u2014 Else whence this pleasing hope, this fond desire, This longing after immortality ? Or whence this secret dread, and inward horror, Of falling into nought ? Why shrinks the soul Back on herself, and startles at destruction ? 'Tis the Divinity that stirs within us ; 'Tis Heaven itself that points out an hereafter, And intimates eternity to man. Eternity ! thou pleasing, dreadful, thought ! Through what variety of untried being, Through what new scenes and changes must we pass ! The wide, th' unbounded prospect lies before me ; But shadows, clouds, and darkness, rest upon it. Here will I hold. If there's a power above us, (And that there is, all Nature cries aloud Through all her works,) he must delight in virtue, And that which he delights in must be happy. But when, or where ? \u2014 This world was made for C\u00e6sar. I'm weary of conjectures \u2014 this must end 'em. Thus am I doubly arm'd. \u2014 My death and life, My bane and antidote are both before me. This in a moment brings me to an end ; But this informs me I shall never die. The soul, secured in her existence, smiles At the drawn dagger, and defies its point ; The stars shad fade away, the sun himself Grow dim with age, and nature sink in years ; But thou shalt flourish in immortal youth, Unhurt amidst the war of elements, The wreck of matter, and the crush of worlds.

The following dialogue was recited in one of the intervals between the acts of the A ulularia of Plautus, as represented in the Classic Theatre of Beading School, soon after the outbreak of the French Re- volution. The rising curtain discovered a rural prospect, with Basil and Colin seated under a beech tree. Colin, who had just finished the air of the \" Marseillaise Hymn,\" laid aside his pipe, and Basil. warmly pressing his hand and starting up, began the following address : \u2014 Basil. Yes, I must go, and, going, bid adieu To all my heart holds dear, to France, and you ! Friend of my happier days, that come no more, Can I those days review, and not deplore, While my last looks regard my native place, My destined exile 'midst a foreign race ? Here, all at ease, my friend shall oft be laid, Tuning his reed beneath this beechen shade, Which long has shelter'd his paternal cot, Whde banish'd Basil mourns a different lot ! Here oft my friend shall zealous snatch his reed, While Phillis trips in view along the mead, And raising to the downs her raptured eyes, Responsive sings, when she her swain descries. Colin. A God, a God, my Basil, has on me These blessings shower' d \u2014 for such is Liberty ; To whom my hands shall rear the votive shrine, For He has made these downs for ever mine, And bids me gaily, with a master's ease, Play on my pipe whatever airs I please ! Basil, The sorrowing Basil envies not your joy, Who deem the poisons sweet that most destroy ;"], [265, "PATHETIC PIECES. 251 Your joy I envy not ; for, sure, I see One fatal cloud o'ershadowing you and me, Certain that he who stays, and he who goes, Walks on a ridge, to fall each way on woes. Mark my tired flock ! o'er many a hill and dale Scarce have I dragg'd them to this freshening vale ; But now two lambs, that ewe down-drooping bore, Died when their dam could yield them milk no more, Prime of my flock, on these rough rocks they lie, Where mid-day Ph\u0153bus darts his burning eye. But oft these coming ids dire omens spoke, The screaming raven, and the blasted oak. And when I saw old manners fast decay, Saw untaught hinds the ruler's work essay, And change the sheep-walk for the common weal, I fear'd the gathering tempest which I feel. But say, dear Colin, why you scorn'd my fear, And, wrapt in perils, thought no perils near 1 Colin. And here are none, since Paris, to my mind, Has shown, at length, the Rights of ad mankind ; And taught my spirit, tid this light arose, We bunglers slumber'd in a fool's repose. Paris I erst conceived, unletter'd clown, But little nobler than our country town ; But that imperial city this exceeds, As yon broad-branching oak the forest weeds. Basil. What led you first the city to behold ? Colin. Inspired by Freedom \u2014 not allured by gold. For when I caught the rumours spreading round, That treasured wisdom, hid for ages, found In that great city, where our kings reside, Would teach the poor to humble tyrant pride ; Scorning awhde the pastoral scrip and crook, Taught by new maxims, I no more could brook"], [266, "252 PATHETIC PIECES. l* To crouch a slave beneath a tyrant's sway, Or fear the sprites now fled from wisdom's day. Basil. Ah ! love-lorn Phillis, now the cause I see Why thy best pears hung lingering on the tree : Colin was absent. Thee the beauteous maid Would carol oft beneath this beechen shade, And down the dale, and up the thymy steep Would sing of Colin while she watch'd his sheep ; Winds and wild woods received her plaintive song, For Colin's absence was, alas ! too long. Colin. What ! when I stay'd to gather new-born truth. And, 'scaped the bigot fables of my youth, Return'd a man, who was a slave before, Nor blest tdl now with wisdom's richest store. Basil, To man, when hoar experience wisdom brings, She asks the pause of time to fledge its wings. Mushrooms soon rise, and show their dunghill birth, Not so the monarch trees of nobler worth. Better all darkness than a meteor's light, Misleading those who would not dare the night, But, safe at home, expect the God of Day To look from heaven, and point the perfect way. Colin. Saws and old sayings ! prithee, Basil, spare The moody babblings of sententious care ; And let us chant with gratulating lays The bursting forth of Freedom's sun -bright rays. For now, dear Liberty, who hears our prayer, Bids us be free, as our first fathers were, When, rushing from their pathless waste of wood, They pour'd o'er beauteous Gaul their conquering flood ' Basil. Yes, my loved France, thy beauty not to see, Would argue blind ingratitude in me. But tho' decaying strength and hoary hairs Admonish me of life's increasing cares,"], [267, "253 PATHETIC PIECES. Yet far away from wonted scenes I fly To Britain's freer realm, tho' fiercer sky. Colin. Unfortunate old man ! why thus depart From home, from fields, and friends that claim thy heart ? Here with thy Colin, under well-known trees, Thou mayest share the song and balmy breeze, Still tend thy flock in healthy pasture gay, And still thy native lawns and streams survey. Far hence, in vain thy eyes will oft desire Thy dear old vidage, and its sacred spire, Which, towering 'mid the limes, declares the place That holds the reverenced relics of thy race. Basil. Yet can that ravaged hill the joy bestow It yielded once, when graced with many a row Of shadowy elm, where oft with listening ears We heard the clipping of the woodman's shears ; Or, better pleased, from many a laurel grove Caught, at still eve, the cooing of the dove. Say, where is now the dome, whose towery gate Expanded wide with hospitable state ? Ruin'd its glories, levell'd with the ground ! No longer there the courteous feasts resound ; Nor there, with well-spread board, and beckoning hands, Hereditary Bounty gracious stands. These bonds dissolved, the noble race no more, I seek, indignant, Britain's sea-beat shore. Colin. And there that freedom seek you scorn at home ! Basil. It is not here, or I should idly roam, And shame these hoary hairs. Can Freedom's glories or its arts reside Where Rapine rolls his desolating tide ; Where ravenous Indigence, and Atheism dire, Damp dear Religion's zeal, and Honour's fire ; Where low-born Envy noble birth assails, And Wit unprincipled o'er Truth prevails ;"], [268, "254 PATHETIC PIECES. Where a great natiou acts the spoiler-knave, The largess snatching, which it never gave ; And while it holds the Rights of Men in view, Does what it has no right, but strength, to do ? Grant freedom good, 'tis pilfer'd here, not won ; Nor shines a deed by manly courage done. Grant that the fane of Freedom here might tower, Your fabric's but the vision of the hour : Raised on Injustice, heavenly Vengeance soon Shall close in night its visionary noon ! I go- Colin. And wheresoe'er my Basil goes Be Friendship still at hand to soothe his woes. Basil. Farewell ! a long farewell to France and thee ! And think how many noble minds with me, At duty's call, forsake the scenes they loved, And seek a climate from their world removed. Yet France stdl reigns in theirs and Basil's breast, And be his bodings false, so she is blest. Colin. At least this night with me you may abide, For see ! the sun has leapt the mountain's side ; The shadows lengthen ; and yon hoary fane, Which lately held Religion's cloister'd train, Receives the labour'd oxen from the fields, And to their wants the treasured fodder yields. Basil. Where once the fainting pilgrim found repose, And life grew pure by penitential woes ; Where sacred studies chose their calm retreat, And spreading Science might have found her seat, There rustic hinds usurp the hallow'd dome, And barbarous Licence calls the cattle home. Hence, Liberty, to Britain's realm I go, WTiere thou wast train'd by Wisdom, sure and slow ; Where Justice still thy sacred precincts guards, And pure Religion deals her best rewards ;"], [269, "255 PATHETIC PIECES. Where, if, 'mid many faithful, still are found The faithless few, thy vitals fierce to wound, Still British sense and dignity defy The yelling harpies of Impiety, Sedition's raven roar, and Rapine's cormorant cry. CHAPTER X. JAFFIER AND PIERRE. Jctff. By heaven, you stir not ; I must be heard, I must have leave to speak : Thou hast disgraced me, Pierre, by a vile blow ; Had not a dagger done thee nobler justice ? But use me as thou wilt, thou canst not wrong me, For I am faden beneath the basest injuries ; Yet look upon me with an eye of mercy, With pity and with charity behold me ; Shut not thy heart against a friend's repentance ; But, as there dwells a godlike nature in thee, Listen with mildness to my supplications. Pier. What whining monk art thou ? what holy cheat, That would'st encroach upon my credulous ears, And cant'st thus vilely ? Hence ! I know thee not. Jaff. Not know me, Pierre ! Pier. No, know thee not ; what art thou ? Jaff. Jaffier, thy friend, thy once loved, valued friend ! Tho' now deservedly scorn' d, and used most hardly. Pier. Thou Jaffier ! thou' my once loved, valued friend ! By heavens, thou liest ; the man so cad'd my friend Was generous, honest, faithful, just, and valiant, Noble in mind, and in his person lovely, Dear to my eyes, and tender to my heart : But thou a wretched, base, false, worthless coward, Poor even in soul, and loathsome in thy aspect :"], [270, "256 PATHETIC PIECES. All eyes must shun thee, and all hearts detest thee. Prithee avoid, nor longer cling thus round me, Like something baneful that my nature's chill'd at. Jaff. I have not wrong'd thee, by these tears I have not, But still am honest, true, and hope, too, valiant ; My mind still fud of thee, therefore still noble. Let not thy eyes, theu, shun me, nor thy heart Detest me utterly : Oh ! look upon me, Look back and see my sad, sincere submission ! How my heart swells, as e'en 'twould burst my bosom ; Fond of its goal, and labouring to be at thee : What shall I do ? what say to make thee hear me ? Pier. Hast thou not wrong'd me ? dar'st thou call thyself That once loved, valued friend of mine, And swear thou hast not wrong'd me ? Whence these chains ! Whence the vile death which I may meet this moment ? Whence this dishonour, but from thee, thou false one ? Jaff. Ad's true ; yet grant one thing, and I've done asking. Pier. What's that? Jaff, To take thy life on such conditions The council have proposed : thou and thy friend May yet live long, and to be better treated. Pier. Life ! ask my life ! confess ! record myself A villain for the privilege to breathe, And carry up and down this cursed city A discontented and repining spirit, Burdensome to itself, a few years longer, To lose it, may be, at last, in a lewd quarrel For some new friend, treacherous and false as thou art ! No, this vile world and I have long been jangling, And cannot part on better terms than now, When only men like thee are fit to live in't. Jaff. By all that's just Pier. Swear by some other powers, For thou hast broken that sacred oath too lately."], [271, "PATHETIC PIECES. 257 are thine Jaff. Then, by that hell I merit, I'll not leave thee Till to thyself at least thou'rt reconciled, I.WUUJCU, However thy resentment deal with me. Pier. Not leave me ! Jaff. No ; thou shalt not force me from thee ; Use me reproachfully, and like a slave ; Tread on me, buffet me, heap wrongs on wrongs On my poor head ; I'll bear it all with patience : I'll weary out thy most friendly cruelty, Lie at thy feet and kiss 'em, though they spurn me, Tdl, wounded by my sufferings, thou relent, And raise me to thy arms with dear forgiveness. Pier. Art thou not Jaff. What? Pier. A traitor ? Jaff. Yes. Pier. A villain ? Jaff. Granted. Pier. A coward, a most scandalous coward, Spiritless, void of honour, one who has sold Thy everlasting fame for shameless life ? Jaff. All, all, and more, much more ; my faults numberless. Pier. And would'st thou have me live on terms like Base as thou'rt false Jaff. No ; 'tis to me that's granted ; The safety of thy life was all I aim'd at, In recompense for faith and trust so broken. Pier. I scorn it more, because preserved by thee ; And as when first my foolish heart took pity On thy misfortunes, sought thee in thy miseries, Relieved thy wants, and raised thee from thy state Of wretchedness in which thy fate had plunged thee, To rank thee in my list of noble friends, All I received, in surety for thy truth,"], [272, "258 PATHETIC PIECES. Were unregarded oaths, and this, this dagger, Given with a worthless pledge thou since hast stolen ; So I restore it back to thee again, Swearing, by ad those powers which thou hast violated, Never from this curs'd hour to hold communion, Friendship, or interest with thee, tho' our years Were to exceed those limited the world. Take it. Farewell, for now I owe thee nothing. Jaff. Say thou wilt live then. Pier. For my hfe, dispose of it Just as thou wilt, because 'tis what I'm tired with. Jaff. 0 Pierre ! Pier. No more. Jaff. My eyes won't lose the sight of thee, But languish after thine, and ache with gazing. Pier. Leave me. Nay, then thus, thus I throw thee from me, And curses, great as thy falsehood, catch thee. Venice Preserved. CHAPTER XI. EDWARD AND WARWICK. Edw. Let me have no intruders ; above all, Keep Warwick from my sight Enter Warwick. War. Behold him here ; No welcome guest, it seems, unless I ask My lord of Suffolk's leave \u2014 there was a time When Warwick wanted not his aid to gain Admission here. Edw. There was a time, perhaps, When Warwick more desired, and more \u2014 deserved it. War. Never ; I've been a foolish faithful slave ; All my best years, the morning of my life,"], [273, "PATHETIC PIECES. 259 Hath been devoted to your service : what Are now the fruits ? Disgrace and infamy ; My spotless name, which never yet the breath Of calumny had tainted, made the mock For foreign fools to carp at : but 'tis fit Who trust in princes, should be thus rewarded. Edw. I thought, my lord, I had full wed repaid Your services with honours, wealth, and power Unlimited : thy all-directing hand Guided in secret every latent wheel Of government, and moved the whole machine : Warwick was all in ad, and powerless Edward Stood like a cypher in the great account. War. Who gave that cypher worth, and seated thee On England's throne ? Thy undistinguish'd name Had rotted in the dust from whence it sprang, And moulder'd in obdvion, had not Warwick Dug from its sordid mine the useless ore, And stamp'd it with a diadem. Thou know'st This wretched country, doom'd, perhaps, like Rome, To fall by its own self-destroying hand, Tost for so many years in the rough sea Of civil discord, but for me had perish'd. In that distressful hour I seized the helm, Bade the rough waves subside in peace, and steer'd Your shatter'd vessel safe into the harbour. You may despise, perhaps, that useless aid Which you no longer want ; but know, proud youth, He who forgets a friend, deserves a foe. Edw. Know, too, reproach for benefits received Pays every debt, and cancels obdgation. War. Why, that, indeed, is frugal honesty, A thrifty saving knowledge : when the debt Grows burdensome, and cannot be discharged, A sponge will pipe out all, and cost you nothing."], [274, "260 PATHETIC PIECES. lj Edw. When you have counted o'er the numerous train Of mighty gifts your bounty lavish'd on me, You may remember next the injuries Which I have done you ; let me know them all, And I will make you ample satisfaction. War. Thou canst not : thou hast robb'd me of a jewel It is not in thy power to restore : I was the first, shall future annals say, That broke the sacred bond of public trust And mutual confidence ; ambassadors, In after times, mere instruments, perhaps, Of venal statesmen, shall recall my name To witness, that they want not an example, And plead my guilt, to sanctify their own. Amidst the herd of mercenary slaves That haunt your court, could none be found but Warwick, To be the shameless herald of a lie ? Edw. And wouldst thou turn the vile reproach on me ? If I have broke my faith, and stain'd the name Of England, thank thy own pernicious counsels That urged me to it, and extorted from me A cold consent to what my heart abhorr'd. War. I have been abused, insulted, and betray'd : My injured honour cries aloud for vengeance ; Her wounds will never close ! Edw. These gusts of passion Will but inflame them ; if I have been right Inform' d, my lord, besides these dangerous scars Of bleeding honour, you have other wounds As deep, though not so fatal : such, perhaps, As none but fair Elizabeth can cure. War. Elizabeth! Edw. Nay, start not, I have cause To wonder most : I little thought indeed When Warwick told me I might learn to love,"], [275, "PATHETIC PIECES. 261 He was himself so able to instruct me : But I've discover'd all. War. And so have I ; Too well I know thy breach of friendship there, Thy fruitless base endeavours to supplant me. Edw. I scorn it, sir \u2014 Elizabeth hath charms, And I have equal right with you to admire them : Nor see I aught so god-like in the form, So all-commanding in the name of Warwick, That he alone should revel in the charms Of beauty, and monopolize perfection. I knew not of your love. War. By Heaven, 'tis false ! You knew it all, and meanly took occasion, Whdst I was busied in the noble office Your grace thought fit to honour me withal, To tamper with a weak unguarded woman, To bribe her passions high, and basely steal A treasure which your kingdom could not purchase. Edw. How know you that ? But be it as it may, I had a right, nor will I tamely yield My claim to happiness, the privilege To choose the partner of my throne and bed ; It is a branch of my prerogative. War. Prerogative ? what's that ? the boast of tyrants ; A borrow'd jewel, glittering in the crown With specious lustre, lent but to betray. You had it, sir, and hold it \u2014 from the people. Edw. And therefore do I prize it ; I would guard Their liberties, and they shall strengthen mine ; But when proud faction, and her rebel crew, Insult their sovereign, trample on his laws, And bid defiance to his power, the people, In justice to themselves, will then defend His cause and vindicate the rights they gave."], [276, "262 PATHETIC PIECES. War. Go to your darling people, then ; for soon, If I mistake not, 'twill be needful ; try Their boasted zeal, and see if one of them Will dare to lift his arm up in your cause, If I forbid them. Ediv. Is it so, my lord ? Then mark my words : I've been your slave too long, And you have ruled me with a rod of iron ; But henceforth know, proud peer, I am thy master, And will be so : the king, who delegates His power to others' bands, but ill deserves The crown he wears. War. Look wed then to your own ; It sits but loosely on your head ; for know, The man who injured Warwick, never pass'd Unpunished yet. Edw. Nor he who threaten'd Edward \u2014 You may repent it, sir. \u2014 My guards there ! \u2014 seize This traitor, and convey him to the Tower ; There let him learn obedience. Earl of Warwick. CHAPTER XII. ORLANDO AND ADAM. Orla. Who's there ? Adam. What! my young master ! 0 my gentle master, Oh, my sweet master, 0 you memory Of old Sir Rowland ! why, what makes you here ? Why are you virtuous ? Why do people love you ? And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant ? Why would you be so fond to overcome The bony priser of the humorous Duke 1 Your praise is come too swiftly home before you. Know you not, master, to some kind of men"], [277, "PATHETIC pieces. 263 go? food. Their graces serve them but as enemies ? No more do yours : your virtues, gentle master, Are sanctified and holy traitors to you. Oh, what a world is this, when what is comely Invenoms him that bears it ! Orla. Why, what's the matter ? Adam. 0 unhappy youth, Come not within these doors ; within this roof The enemy of all your graces lives : Your brother \u2014 (no ; no brother ; yet the son, \u2014 Yet not the son ; I wid not call him son Of him I was about to call his father,) Hath heard your praises, and this night he means To burn the lodging where you used to lie, And you within it ; if he fail of that, He will have other means to cut you off; I overheard him, and his practices : This is no palace ; this house is but a butchery ; Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it. Orla. Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me Adam. No matter whither, so you come not here. Orla. What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce A thievish living on the common road ? This must I do, or know not what to do : Yet this I will not do, do how I can ; I rather will subject me to the malice Of a diverted blood, and bloody brother. Adam. But do not so ; I have five hundred crowns, The thrifty hire I saved under your father, Which I did store, to be my foster-nurse When service should in my old limbs lie lame, And unregarded age in corners thrown : Take that ; and He that doth the ravens feed, Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,"], [278, "264 PATHETIC PIECES. Be comfort to my age ! here is the gold. All this I give you, let me be your servant ; Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty ; For in my youth I never did apply Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood ; Nor did I with unbashful forehead woo The means of weakness and debility ; Therefore my age is as a lusty winter, Frosty, but kindly ; let me go with you I'd do the service of a younger man In all your business and necessities. Orla. Oh ; good old man, how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world ; When service sweat for duty, not for meed ! Thou art not for the fashion of these times, Where none will sweat but for promotion ; And having that do choke their service up Even with the having ; it is not so with thee ; But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree, That cannot so much as a blossom yield, In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry. But come thy ways, we'll go along together ; And ere we have thy youthful wages spent, AVe'll light upon some settled low content. Adam. Master, go on ; and I will follow thee To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty ; From seventeen years till now, almost fourscore, Here lived I, but now live here no more. At seventeen years, many their fortunes seek, But at fourscore, it is too late a week ; Yet fortune cannot recompense me better Than to die well, and not my master's debtor.

And you in hell, as often as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of. Glen. I blame him not : at my nativity, The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes, Of burning cressets : know that at my birth, The frame and the foundation of the earth Shook like a coward. Hot. So it would have done At the same season if your mother's cat Had kitten'd, though yourself had ne'er been born. Glen. I say, the earth did shake when I was born. Hot. I say, the earth then was not of my mind, If you suppose, as fearing you, it shook. Glen. The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble. Hot. 0, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire, And not in fear of your nativity. Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth In strange eruptions ; and the teeming earth Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd, By the imprisoning of unruly wind Within her womb ; which for enlargement striving, Shakes the old beldame earth, and topples down High towers and moss-grown steeples. At your birth, Our grandam earth, with this distemperature In passion shook. Glen. Cousin, of many men N"], [280, "266 PATHETIC PIECES. I do not bear these crossings : give me leave To tell you once again, that at my birth The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes; The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds Were strangely clamorous in the frighted fields : These signs have mark'd me extraordinary, And all the courses of my life do show, I am not in the roll of common men. Where is he living, dipt in with the sea, That chides the banks of England, Wales, or Scotland, Who calls me pupil, or hath read to me ? And bring him out, that is but woman's son, Can trace me in the tedious ways of art, Or hold me pace in deep experiments. Hot. I think there is no man speaks better Welsh. Glen. I can speak English, lord, as well as you, For I was train'd up in the English court : Where, being young, I framed to the harp Many an English ditty, lovely well, And gave the tongue a helpful ornament ; A virtue that was never seen in you. Hot. Marry, and I am glad of it with all my heart, I had rather be a kitten, and cry mew, Than one of these same metre-ballad mongers ! I'd rather hear a brazen candlestick turn'd, Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree, And that would nothing set my teeth on edge, Nothing so much as mincing poetry ; 'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag. Glen. And I can call spirits from the vasty deep. Hot. WThy, so can I, or so can any man : But will they come when you do call for them ? Glen. Why, I can teach thee to comma.-- ' - -\"\"\u25a0vii.

Let me see some more. \" The purpose you undertake is dangerous.\" Why, that is certain : it is dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to drink : but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this nettle danger, we pluck this flower safety. \" The purpose you undertake is dangerous, the friends you have named uncertain, the time itself unsorted, and your whole plot too light, for the counterpoise of so great an opposition.\" Say you so, say you so ? \u2014 I say unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind, and you lie. What a lack-brain is this ? By the Lord, our plot is a good plot as ever was laid ; our friends true and constant : a good plot, good friends, and full of ex pectation ; an excellent plot, very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue this is ! Why, my lord of York com mends the plot, and the general course of the action. By this hand, if I were now by this rascal, I could brain him with his lady's fan. Is there not my father, my uncle, and myself, Lord Edmund Mortimer, my lord of York, and Owen Glendower? Is there not, besides, the Douglas? Have I not all their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of next month ? and are there not some of them set forward already ?

How many thousands of my poorest subjects Are at this hour asleep ! 0 gentle Sleep, Nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee, That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down, And steep my senses in forgetfulness ?

AVilt thou, upon the high and giddy mast, Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains, In cradle of the rude imperious surge ? And in the visitation of the winds, Who take the ruffian billows by the top, Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them With deafening clamours in the slippery shrouds, That, with the hurly, death itself awakes : Canst thou, 0 partial Sleep, give thy repose To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude ; And, in the calmest and the stillest night,"], [283, "PATHETIC PIECES. 269 With all appliances and means to boot, Deny it to a king ?

Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought. I stay too long by thee, I weary thee. Dost thou so hunger for my empty chair, That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours Before thy hour be ripe ? 0 foolish youth ! Thou seek'st the greatness that will overwhelm thee. Stay but a little, for my cloud of dignity Is held from fading with so weak a wind, That it will quickly drop ; my day is dim. Thou hast stolen that which, after some few hours, Were thine without offence ; and, at my death, Thou hast seal'd up my expectation ; Thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not, And thou wilt have me die assured of it. Thou hid'st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts, Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart, To stab at half an hour of my frail life. What ! canst thou not forbear me half an hour ? Then get thee gone, and dig my grave thyself, And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear That thou art crown'd, not that I am dead. Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head ; Only compound me with forgotten dust, Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.

And to the English court assemble now, From every region, apes of idleness : Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum ; Have you a ruffian that will swear ? drink ? dance ? Revel the night ? rob ? murder ? and commit The oldest sins the newest kind of ways 1 Be happy, he will trouble you no more ; England shall give him office, honour, might ; For the Fifth Harry from curb'd licence plucks The muzzle of restraint ! and the wild dog Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent. 0 my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows ! When that my care could not withhold thy riot, What wilt thou do when riot is thy care ? Oh, thou wilt be a wilderness again, Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants ! P. Henry. Oh, pardon me, my liege ! but for my tears (The moist impediments unto my speech), I had forestad'd this dear and deep rebuke Ere you with grief had spoke, and I had heard The course of it so far. There is your crown, And He that wears the crown immortally, Long guard it yours ! If I affect it more Than as your honour, and as your renown, Let me no more from this obedience rise, Which my most true and inward-duteous spirit Teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending. Heaven witness with me, when I here came in, And found no course of breath within your majesty, How cold it struck my heart ! If I do feign, 0 let me in my present wildness die, And never live to show th' incredulous world"], [285, "PATHETIC PIECES. 271 The noble change that I have purposed. Coming to look on you, thinking you dead (And dead almost, my liege, to think you were), I spake unto the crown, as having sense, And thus upbraided it. The care on thee depending Hath fed upon the body of my father ; Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold ; Other, less fine in carat, is more precious, Preserving life in med'cine potable ; But thou, most fine, most honour'd, most renown'd, Hast eat thy bearer up. Thus, royal liege, Accusing it, I put it on my head, To try with it (as with an enemy That had before my face murder'd my father) The quarrel of a true inheritor. But if it did infect my blood with joy, Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride, If any rebel or vain spirit of mine Did, with the least affection of a welcome, Give entertainment to the might of it, Let Heaven for ever keep it from my head, And make me as the poorest vassal is, That doth with awe and terror kneel to it ! K. Henry. 0 my son ! Heaven put it in thy mind to take it hence, That thou might'st win the more thy father's love, Pleading so wisely in excuse of it. Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed, And hear, I think, the very latest counsel That ever I shall breathe. Heaven knows,' my son, By what bye-paths, and indirect crook'd ways I met this crown ; and I myself know wed How troublesome it sat upon my head. To thee it shall descend with better quiet, Better opinion, better confirmation ; For all the soil of the achievement goes"], [286, "272 PATHETIC PIECES. AVith me into the earth. It seem'd in me But as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand, And I had many living to upbraid My gain of it by their assistances, Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed, Wounding supposed peace. All their bold feats, Thou seest, with peril I have answer'd. For all my reign hath been but as a scene Acting that argument ; and now my death Changes the mode ; for what in me was purchased, Falls upon thee in a much fairer sort ; For thou the garland wear'st successively. Yet though thou stand'st more sure than I could do, Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green ; A nd all my friends, which thou must make thy friends, Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out ; By whose fell working I was first advanced, And by whose power I well might lodge a fear To be again displaced ; which to avoid I cut them off, and had a purpose now To lead out many to the Holy Land, Lest rest and lying still might make them look Too near into my state. Therefore, my Harry, Be it thy course to busy giddy minds With foreign quarrels ; that action, hence borne out, May waste the memory of former days. More would I, but my lungs are wasted so, That strength of speech is utterly denied me. How T came to the crown, 0 God, forgive ! And grant it may with thee in true peace live ! P. Henry. My gracious liege, You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me ; Then plain and right must my possession be ; Which I with more than with a common pain, 'Gainst all the world, will rightfully maintain.

No, my fair cousin ; If we are mark'd to die, we are enow To do our country loss ; and if to live, The fewer men, the greater share of honour. God's wid ! I pray thee wish not one man more. By Jove ! I am not covetous of gold, Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost ; It yearns me not if men my garments wear ; Such outward things dwell not in my desires ; But if it be a sin to covet honour, I am the most offending soul alive. No, 'faith, my lord, wish not a man from England : God's peace, I would not lose so great an honour As one man more, methinks, would share from me, For the best hopes I have. Don't wish one more ; Rather proclaim it (Westmoreland) through my host, That he which hath uo stomach to this fight, Let him depart ; his passport shall be made, And crowns for convoy put into his purse : We would not die in that man's company, That fears his fellowship to die with us. This day is call'd the Feast of Crispian : He that outlives this day, and comes safe home, Will stand a tip-toe when this day is named, And rouse him at the name of Crispian : He that outlives this day, and sees old age, Will yearly, on the vigil, feast his neighbours, And say, To-morrow is Saint Crispian ; Then will he strip his sleeve, and show his scars. Old men forget ; yet shad not ad forget, n 3"], [288, "274 PATHETIC PIECES. But they'll remember, with advantages, The feats they did that day. Then shall our names, Familiar in their mouths as household words, Harry the king, Bedford, and Exeter, Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Glo'ster, Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd. This story shall the good man teach his son ; And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by From this day to the ending of the world, But we in it shall be remembered : We few, we happy few, we band of brothers ; For he to-day that sheds his blood with me, Shall be my brother ; be he e'er so vile, This day shall gentle his condition. And gentlemen in England, now a-bed, Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here ; And hold their manhoods cheap, while any speaks, That fought with us upon St. Crispian's day. Shakespeare. CHAPTER XVIII. HENRY VI., WARWICK, AND CARDINAL BEAUFORT. K. Henry. How fares my lord ? Speak, Beaufort, to thy sovereign. Car. If thou be'st death, I'll give thee England's treasure, Enough to purchase such another island, So wilt thou let me live, and feel no pain. K. Henry. Ah, what a sign it is of evil life, Where death's approach is seen so terrible ! War. Beaufort, it is thy sovereign speaks to thee. Car. Bring me unto my trial when you wid. Died he not in his bed ? Where should he die ? Can I make men live whether they will or no ? Oh ! torture me no more, I wdl confess \u2014"], [289, "PATHETIC PIECES. 275 Alive again ? Then show me where he is : I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him \u2014 He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them : Comb down his hair ; \u2014 look ! look ! it stands upright, Like lime twigs set to catch my winged soul. Give me some drink, and bid th' apothecary Bring the strong poison that I bought of him. K. Henry. 0 thou eternal Mover of the Heavens ! Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch ; Oh, beat away the busy meddling fiend, That lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul, And from this bosom purge this black despair. \u2014 Peace to his soul, if God's good pleasure be ! Lord Cardinal, if thou think'st on Heaven's bliss, Hold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope. He dies, and makes no sign ! 0 God, forgive him ! War. So bad a death argues a monstrous life. K. Henry. Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all ; Close up his eyes, and draw the curtain close, And let us ad to meditation. Shakespeare. CHAPTER XIX. WOLSEY AND CROMWELL. Wol, Farewell, a long farewell to all my greatness ! This is the state of man : to-day he puts forth The tender leaves of hope ; to-morrow blossoms, And bears his blushing honours thick upon him ; The third day comes a frost, a killing frost, And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely His greatness is a ripening, nips his root ; And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured, Like little wanton boys, that swim on bladders, These many summers in a sea of glory ;"], [290, "276 PATHETIC PIECES. of it But far beyond my depth : my high-blown pride At length broke under me ; and now has left me, Weary, and old with service, to the mercy Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me. Vain pomp and glory of the world, I hate ye ! I feel my heart new open'd. Oh, how wretched Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours ! There is, betwixt that smile he would aspire to, That sweet aspect of princes, and his ruin, More pangs and fears than war or women have ; Aud when he falls, he falls like Lucifer, Never to hope again. Why, how now, Cromwell ? Crom. I have no power to speak, sir. Wol. What, amazed At my misfortunes ? Can thy spirit wonder A great man should decline ? Nay, if you weep, I'm fallen indeed. Crom. How does your grace ? Wol. Why, well ; Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell. I know myself now, and I feel within me A peace above all earthly dignities ; A still and quiet conscience. The King has cured me. I humbly thank his grace ; and, from these shoulders, These ruin'd pillars, out of pity taken A load would sink a navy, too much honour. O, 'tis a burthen, Cromwell, 'tis a burthen, Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven ! Crom. I'm glad your grace has made that right use Wol, I hope I have ; I'm able now, methinks, Out of a fortitude of soul I feel, T' endure more miseries, and greater far, Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer. What news abroad ?"], [291, "PATHETIC PIECES. 277 O Crom. The heaviest and the worst, Is your displeasure with the King. Wol. God bless him. Crom. The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen Lord Chancellor in your place. Wol. That's somewhat sudden \u2014 But he's a learned man. May he continue Long in his highness' favour, and do justice For truth's sake and his conscience ; that his bones, When he has run his course, and sleeps in blessings, May have a tomb of orphan's tears wept on him ! What more ? Crom. That Cranmer is return'd with welcome ; Instad'd Lord Archbishop of Canterbury. Wol. That's news indeed. Crom. Last, that the Lady Anne, Whom the King hath in secrecy long married, This day was view'd in open as his Queen Going to chapel ; and the voice is now Only about her coronation. Wol, There was the weight that pull'd me down Cromwell, The King has gone beyond me : all my glories In that one woman I have lost for ever. No sun shall ever usher forth my honours, Or gild again the noble troops that waited Upon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwed ; I am a poor fallen man, unworthy now To be thy lord and master. Seek the King (That sun I pray may never set). I've told him, What and how true thou art ; he will advance thee ; Some little memory of me will stir him (I know his noble nature) not to let Thy hopeful service perish too. Good Cromwell, Neglect him not ; make use now, and provide For thine own future safety."], [292, "278 PATHETIC PIECES. Crom. 0 my lord, Must I then leave you ? Must I needs forego So good, so noble, and so true a master ? Bear witness all that have not hearts of iron, With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord. The King shall have my service ; but my prayers For ever, and for ever, shad be yours. Wol. Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear In all my miseries, but thou hast forced me, Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman. Let's dry our eyes ; and thus far hear me, Cromwell, And when I am forgotten, as I shall be, And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention Of me must more be heard, say then I taught thee ; Say, AVolsey, that once rode the waves of glory, And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour, Found thee a way out of his wreck, to rise in ; A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it. Mark but my fall, and that which ruin'd me ; Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition ; By that sin fell the angels ; how can man then (Though th' image of his Maker) hope to win by 't ? Love thyself last ; cherish those hearts that wait thee ; Corruption wins not more than honesty. Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace, To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not. Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's, Thy God's, and truth's ; then if thou fall'st, 0 Cromwell Thou fall'st a blessed martyr. Serve the King \u2014 And pr'ythee lead me in \u2014 There take an inventory of all I have, To the last penny, 'tis the King's. My robe, And my integrity to Heaven, is all I dare now call my own. 0 Cromwell, Cromwell, Had I but served my God with half the zeal"], [293, "PATHETIC PIECES. 279 I served my King, he would not in mine age Have left me naked to mine enemies. Crom. Good sir, have patience. Wol. So I have. Farewell The hopes of court ! My hopes in Heaven do dwell. Shakespeare. CHAPTER XX. LEAR. Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks ; rage, blow ! You cataracts, and hurricanos, spout Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks ! You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires, Singe my white head. And thou, all-shaking thunder, Strike flat the thick rotundity o' the world ; Crack Nature's mould, all germins spill at once That make ungrateful man ! Rumble thy bellyfull ! Spit, fire, spout, rain ! Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters. I tax not you, ye elements, with unkindness ; I never gave you kingdom, cad'd you children ; You owe me no subscription. Then let fall Your horrible pleasure. \u2014 Here I stand your slave, A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man : But yet I cad you servile ministers, That have with two pernicious daughters join'd Your high engender' d battles, 'gainst a head, So old and white as this. Oh ! oh ! 'tis foul. Let the great gods, That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads, Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch, Thou hast within thee undivulged crimes, Unwhipp'd of justice ! Hide thee, thou bloody hand ;"], [294, "280 PATHETIC PIECES. Thou perjur'd, and thou simular of virtue, That art incestuous ! caitiff, to pieces shake, That, under cover of convivial seeming, Has practised on man's life \u2014 Close pent-up guilts, Rive your concealing continents, and ask Those dreadful summoners grace ! \u2014 I am a man, More sinn'd against, than sinning. Shakespeare, CHAPTER XXI. macbeth's soliloquy. Is this a dagger which I see before me, The handle toward my hand ? come, let me clutch thee. I have thee not, and yet I see thee still. Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible To feeling, as to sight ? or art thou but A dagger of the mind, a false creation Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain ? I see thee yet, in form as palpable As this which now I draw. \u2014 Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going ; And such an instrument I was to use. Mine eyes are made the fools o' th' other senses, Or else worth all the rest \u2014 I see thee still ; And on the blade of th' dudgeon gouts of blood, Which was not so before. \u2014 There's no such thing. It is the bloody business which informs Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er one half the world Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse The curtain'd sleep ; now witchcraft celebrates Pale Hecate's offerings : and wither'd Murther (Alarum'd by his centinel, the wolf, Whose howl's his watch) thus with his stealthy pace, With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design"], [295, "281 PATHETIC PIECES. Moves like a ghost. Thou sound and firm-set earth, Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear The very stones prate of my whereabout : And take the present horror from the time, Which now suits with it. Whilst I threat, he lives- I go, and it is done ; the bell invites me. Hear it not, Duncan ; for it is a knell That summons thee to heaven or to hell. Shakespeare. CHAPTER XXII. plato's treatise on immortality. E\u00abra$ *H\"wi K.Xtofifigoroi u ' fj.^^a.Kiurns. *.r.X. Farewell, bright Sun ! the rapt enthusiast cried, And plunged adventurous in the roaring tide. Not urged by wrongs, \u2014 by life's career untired, \u2014 But by the hope, which Plato taught, inspired. CHAPTER XXIII. MACDUFF, MALCOLM, AND ROSSE. Macd. See who comes here ! Mai. My countryman ; but yet I know him not. Macd, My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither. Mai. I know him now. Good God, betimes remove The means that makes us strangers ! Rosse. Sir, Amen. Macd. Stands Scotland where it did ? Rosse. Alas, poor country, Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot Be cad'd our mother, but our grave ; where nothing, But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile ; Where sighs and groans, and shrieks that rend the air, Are made, not mark'd ; where violent sorrow seems A modern ecstacy ; the dead man's knell"], [296, "282 PATHETIC pieces. Is there scarce ask'd, for whom : and good men's lives Expire before the flowers in their caps ; Dying or e'er they sicken. Macd. Oh, relation Too nice and yet too true ! Mai. What's the newest grief? Rosse. That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker, Each minute teems a uew one. Macd. How does my wife ? Rosse. Why, well. \u2014 Macd, And all my children ? Rosse. Well too. Macd. The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace ? Rosse. No ; they were at peace when I did leave 'em. Macd, Be not a niggard of your speech : how goes it ? Rosse. When I come hither to transport the tidings, Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour Of many worthy fellows that were out, Which was to my belief witness'd the rather, For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot. Now is the time of help ; your eye in Scotland Would create soldiers, and make women fight, To doff their dire distresses. Mai. Be't their comfort We're coming thither : gracious England hath Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men ; An older and better soldier, none That Christendom gives out. Rosse. Would I could answer This comfort with the like ; but I have words That would be howl'd out in the desert air, Where hearing should not catch them. Macd. What concern they ? The general cause ? or is it a free-grief, Due to some single breast? Rosse. No mind that's honest,"], [297, "PATHETIC PIECES. 283 But in it shares some woe ; though the main part Pertains to you alone. Macd. If it be mine, Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it. Rosse. Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever, Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound, That ever yet they heard. Macd. Hum ! I guess at it. Rosse. Your castle is surprised, your wife and babes Savagely slaughter'd ; to relate the manner, Were on the quarry of these murther' d deer To add the death of you. Mai. Merciful Heaven ! What, man ! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows ; Give sorrow words ! the grief that does not speak, Whispers the o'er-fraught heart, and bids it break. Macd. My children too ! \u2014 Rosse. Wife, children, servants, all that could be found. Macd. And I must be from thence ! my wife killed too ! Rosse. I've said. Mai. Be comforted. Let's make us med'cines of our great revenge, To cure this deadly grief. Macd. He has no children. All my pretty ones ! Did you say all ? what, all ? oh, hell-kite ! all ? Mai. Endure it like a man. Macd, I shall do so ; But I must also feel it as a man. I cannot but remember such things were, That were most precious to me. Did Heaven look on, And would not take their part ? Sinful Macduff, They were all struck for thee ! naught that I am, Not for their own demerits, but for mine, Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now ! Mai. Be this the whetstone of your sword, let grief Convert to wrath ; blunt not the heart, enrage it."], [298, "284 PATHETIC PIECES. Macd. Oh, I could play the woman with mine eyes, And braggart with my tongue. But, gentle Heaven ! Cut short ad intermission : front to front, Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself; Within my sword's length set him, if he 'scape, Then Heaven forgive him too ! Mai. This tune goes manly. Come, go we to the King, our power is ready ; Our lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may : The night is long that never finds the day. Shakespeare. CHAPTER XXIV. antony's soliloquy over c\u00e6sar's body. 0 pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth ! That I am meek and gentle with these butchers. Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever lived in the tide of times. Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood ! Over thy wounds now do I prophesy, (Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips, To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue,) A curse shall light upon the line of men ; Domestic fury, and fierce civil strife, Shall cumber all the parts of Italy ; Blood and destruction shall be so in use, And dreadful objects so familiar, That mothers shall but smile, when they behold Their infants quarter' d by the hands of war ; All pity choked with custom of fell deeds ; And C\u00e6sar's spirit, ranging for revenge, With Ate by his side come hot from hell, Shall in these confines, with a monarch's voice, Cry, Havock, and let slip the dogs of war. Shakespeare."], [299, "pathetic pieces. 285 CHAPTER XXV. antony's funeral oration over c\u00e6sar's body. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears, I come to buiy C\u00e6sar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them ; The good is oft interred with their bones ; So let it be with C\u00e6sar ! Noble Brutus Hath told you, C\u00e6sar was ambitious : If it were so, it was a grievous fault ; And grievously hath C\u00e6sar answer 'd it. Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest, (For Brutus is an honourable man, So are they all, all honourable men,) Come I to speak in C\u00e6sar's funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me ; But Brutus says, he was ambitious ; And Brutus is an honourable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome, Whose ransoms did the general coffers fid ; Did this in C\u00e6sar seem ambitious ? When that the poor have cried, C\u00e6sar hath wept ; Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious ; And Brutus is an honourable man. You all did see, that, on the Lupercal, I thrice presented him a kingly crown ; Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition ? Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious ; And, sure, he is an honourable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause. What cause withholds you then to mourn for him ?"], [300, "286 pathetic pieces. 0 judgment ! thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason. \u2014 Bear with me. My heart is in the coffin there with C\u00e6sar, And I must pause till it come back to me. If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all do know this mantle ; I remember The first time ever C\u00e6sar put it on, 'Twas on a summer's evening in his tent, That day he overcame the Nervii \u2014 Look ! in this place ran Cassius' dagger through ; See what a rent the envious Casca made. Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd ; And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away, Mark how the blood of C\u00e6sar follow'd it ! As rushing out of doors, to be resolved, If Brutus so unkindly knock' d, or no : For Brutus, as you know, was C\u00e6sar's angel. Judge, 0 ye gods ! how dearly C\u00e6sar loved him : This, this was the unkindest cut of all ; For when the noble C\u00e6sar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms, Quite vanquish'd him ; then burst his mighty heart : And, in his mantle muffling up his face, Even at the base of Pompey's statue, Which all the while ran blood, great C\u00e6sar fell. Oh, what a fall was there, my countrymen ! Then I and you, and all of us, fell down, WThilst bloody treason flourish'd over us. 0, now you weep ; and I perceive you feel The dint of pity ; these are gracious drops. Kind souls ; what, weep you when you but behold Our C\u00e6sar's vesture wounded ? look you here ! Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, by traitors. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up To any sudden flood of mutiny."], [301, "287 PATHETIC PIECES. They that have done this deed are honourable. What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, That made them do it ; they are wise and honourable ; And will, no doubt, with reason answer you. I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts ; I am no orator, as Brutus is : But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man, That loves my friend ; and that they know full well That gave me public leave to speak of him : For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, Action nor utterance, nor the power of speech, To stir men's blood : I only speak right on : I tell you that which you yourselves do know ; Show you sweet C\u00e6sar's wounds, poor, poor dumb mouths ! And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue In every wound of C\u00e6sar, that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny. Shakespeare. CHAPTER XXVI. THE QUARREL OF BRUTUS AND CASSIUS. Cas. That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this, You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella, For taking bribes here of the Sardians ; Wherein my letter (praying on his side, Because I knew the man) was slighted of. Bru. You wrong'd yourself to write in such a case. Cas. In such a time as this, it is not meet That every nice offence should bear its comment. Bru. Yet let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm,"], [302, "288 pathetic pieces. 1 To sell and mart your offices for gold, To undeservers. Cas. I an itching palm ! You know, that you are Brutus that spake this, Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last. Bru. The name of Cassius honours this corruption, And chastisement doth therefore hide its head. Cas. Chastisement ! Bru. Remember March, the ides of March remember Did not great Julius bleed for justice sake ? What villain touch'd his body, that did stab, And not for justice ? What, shall one of us, That struck the foremost man of all this world, But for supporting robbers ; shall we now Contaminate our fingers with base bribes ? And sell the mighty meed of our large honours For so much trash as may be grasped thus ? I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon, Than such a Roman. Cas. Brutus, bay not me, I'd not endure it ; you forget yourself, To hedge me in ; I am a soldier, I, Older in practice, abler than yourself To make conditions. Bru. Go to ; you are not, Cassius, Cas. I am. Bru. I say, you are not. Cas. Urge me no more, I shall forget myself \u2014 Have mind upon your health \u2014 tempt me no further. Bru. Away, slight man ! Cas. Is't possible ? Bru. Hear me, for I wid speak. Must I give way and room to your rash choler ? Shall I be frighted when a madman stares ? Cas. 0 gods ! ye gods ! must I endure ad this ?"], [303, "289 PATHETIC pieces. Bru. All this ? ay more. Fret till your proud heart break Go tell your slaves how choleric you are, And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge ? Must I observe you ? must I stand and crouch Under your testy humour ? By the gods, You shall digest the venom of your spleen, Tho' it do split you ; for from this day forth, I'll use you for my mirth, yea for my laughter, When you are waspish. Cas. Is it come to this ? Bru. You say, you are a better soldier : Let it appear so ; make your vaunting true, And it shall please me well. For mine own part, I shall be glad to learn of noble men. Cas. You wrong me every way \u2014 you wrong me, Brutus ; I said, an elder soldier, not a better ; Did I say better ? Bru. If you did, I care not. Cas. When C\u00e6sar lived, he durst not thus have moved me Bru. Peace, peace, you durst not so have tempted him. Cas. I durst not ! Biii. No. Cas. WTiat ! durst not tempt him ? Bru. For your life you durst not. Cas. Do not presume too much upon my love ; I may do waat I shall be sorry for. Bru. You have done that you should be sorry for. There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats ; For I am arm'd so strong in honesty, That they pass by me, as the idle wind, Which I respect not. I did send to you For certain sums of gold, which you denied me ; For I can raise no money by vile meaus : By heaven, I had rather coin my heart, o"], [304, "290 pathetic pieces. And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash, By any indirection. I did send To you for gold to pay my legions, Which you denied me ; was that done like Cassius ? Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so ?

Oh, I could weep My spirit from mine eyes ! \u2014 There is my dagger, And here my naked breast \u2014 within, a heart Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold !

O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb, That carries anger as the flint bears fire ! Which, much enforced, shows a hasty spark, And straight is cold again. Cas. Hath Cassius lived To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus, When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him ? Bru. AVhen I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too, Cas. Do you confess so much ? Give me your hand. Bru. And my heart too. Cas. 0 Brutus ! Bru. What's the matter ? Cas. Have you not love enough to bear with me, When that rash humour which my mother gave me, Makes me forgetful ?

And when I told thee, he was of my counsel, In my whole course of wooing, thou cry'dst, \" Indeed ! \" And didst contract and purse thy brow together, As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me, Show me thy thought. Iago. My lord, you know I love you. Oth. I think thou dost : And for I know, thou art full of love and honesty, And weigh' st thy words before thou giv'st them breath, Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more : For suoh things in a false disloyal knave Are tricks of custom ; but in a man that's just, They're cold dilations working from the heart, That passion cannot rule.

To die \u2014 to sleep \u2014 To sleep ? perchance to dream ? \u2014 ay, there's the rub ; For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause. \u2014 There's the respect"], [316, "302 PATHETIC PIECES.

Who would fardels bear To groan and sweat under a weary life ; But that the dread of something after death (That undiscover'd country, from whose bourne No traveller returns) puzzles the will ; And makes us rather bear those ills we have, Than fly to others that we know not of ? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all : And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought ; And enterprises of great pith and moment, With this regard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action.

Forgive me my foul murder ! That cannot be, since I am stid possess'd Of those effects for which I did the murder, My crown, mine own ambition, and my Queen. May one be pardon'd, and retain the offence ? In the corrupted currents of this world, Offence's gdded hand may shove by justice ; And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the laws. But 'tis not so above. There is no shuffling ; there the action lies In its true nature, and we ourselves compell'd, Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults, To give in evidence.

Yet what can it, when one cannot repent ? 0 wretched state ! 0 bosom black as death ! 0 Hmed soul, that, struggling to be free, Art more engag'd ! Help, angels ! make assay !

Hark ! the numbers soft and clear, Gently steal upon the ear; Now louder and yet louder rise, And fill with spreading sounds the skies ; Exulting in triumph now swell the bold notes, In broken air, trembling, the wild music floats Till, by degrees, remote and small, The strains decay, And melt away In a dying, dying fall. By music, minds an equal temper know, Nor swell too high, nor sink too low.

While Argo saw her kindred trees Descend from Pelion to the main, Transported demi-gods stood round, And men grew heroes at the sound, Enflamed with glory's charms : Each chief his sevenfold shield display'd, And half unsheath'd the shining blade : And seas, and rocks, and skies rebound To arms, to arms, to arms ! T*ut when through ad the infernal bounds, Which flaming Phlegethon surrounds, Love, strong as Death, the poet led To the pale nations of the dead, What sounds were heard, What scenes appear'd, O'er all the dreary coasts ?

Tho' fate had fast bound her With Styx nine times round her, Yet music and love were victorious. But soon, too soon, the lover turns his eyes ; Again she falls, again she dies, she dies !

There is no difficulty, as most persons are doubtless aware, in ascertaining the latitude, since this problem requires for its solution nothing more than the angular altitude of the sun, moon, star, or planet, on any one of these bodies coming to the meridian. But the longitude being an element de pending on the diurnal rotation of the earth on its axis, requires that the time or hour of the day should be known, not only on board the ship, but also at some other meridian \u2014 as, for instance, that of Greenwich. In order to accomplish this purpose, there are two methods, now universally employed, though both of them were un known in Anson's time. One of these is of great ease and simplicity, but not quite infallible ; the other, somewhat complicated, delicate, and operose, but essentially infallible, \u2014 within certain limits. The first method is that of Chronometers ; and consists in setting one or more well-regulated watches to the time on a given meridian \u2014 that of Greenwich for instance \u2014 and then trusting that those Chronometers will continue to show the true time of that meridian. If these instruments are good, the longitude may at any time be found, by comparing the Greenwich time, as shown by the Chronometers, with the ship's time shown by very simple observations of the sun or"], [328, "314 APPENDIX. stars ; the difference of the two -times, reduced to degrees and minutes, being the longitude. If watches could be made quite perfect, nothing more would be wanted ; but as this is not the case, and we are never sure that they are doing their duty, it becomes quite indispensable to tbe secure navigation of the ship, that a check should be furnished of an infallible nature. This is afforded by the rapidity of the moon's course through the heavens ; and it is only necessary to recall to our recollection the simile of Dr. Woollaston, who calls the moon the hand of a great Greenwich clock in the sky, to render the lunar method of finding the longitude quite plain. By means of our Sextants we can ascertain the exact posi tion of the moon relatively to the sun, or some known star ; and then, by referring to the Nautical Almanac, we discover from previous computations, the exact moment, expressed in Greenwich time, when the moon \u2014 the celestial hand of the Greenwich clock \u2014 was in such and such a position. This time, compared with that found on board the ship, gives the difference of longitude ; and thus \u2014 if the operation be performed with the proper degree of skill, and with instru ments of the proper kind and quality \u2014 an infallible check is furnished upon the uncertain going of the Chronometers.
