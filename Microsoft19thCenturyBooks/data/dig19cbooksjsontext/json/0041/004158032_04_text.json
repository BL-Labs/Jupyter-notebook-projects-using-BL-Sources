Langbaine is a great detector of Plagiarism \u2014 he gives us a great deal of useful information in that way \u2014 he seems however to have had Avrong notions with regard to plagiarism \u2014 in speaking of the Duchess of Newcastle he says \u2014 \" I knoAv there are \" some that have but a mean opinion of her plays, \" but ifit be considered that both the language and \" plots of them are all her own, I think she ought \" with justice to be preferred to others of her sex, \" which have built their fame on other people's foun \" dations \" \u2014 on the other hand he is perpetually cen suring authors (and Ravenscroft in particular) for plagiarism, as if that were the worst fault of which a writer could be guilty \u2014 the Duchess' plays are so bad, that hardly any person Avould read them tAvice \u2014 whereas many of those Avritten by Ravenscroft &c.

Langbaine is very particular in telling us to Avhom the plays are dedicated \u2014 a circumstance Avhich, 99 times in 100, is not of the slightest importance \u2014 Langbaine is not to be depended on as to dates \u2014 nor indeed as to references \u2014 he refers us to Livy for the history of Julius C\u00e6sar \u2014 and to Ammianus Mar cellinus for that of Cambyses and Valentinian \u2014 Am mianus Marcellinus seems not to have mentioned Cambyses, and his history concludes before the time of that Valentinian who is the subject of Fletcher's play. Langbaine's chief fault seems to have been, that he gives the date of the plays according to the copies of them in his possession, without sufficiently consi dering Avhether his copies of those plays were of the first edition, or not \u2014 but with all his faults, his book forms the most valuable part of the Biographia Dramatica \u2014 Langbaine has been servilely copied by his followers in numberless instances. c VOL. n."], [28, "18 T.

THOMAS SHADWELL. ShadAvell died in 1692 \u2014 Malone in his life of Dryden takes much pains to place his private character in the best point of vieAv \u2014 this honest bigotry is very fair \u2014 but Malone seems to have adopted Dryden's enmity to ShadAvell, of Avhom he says \u2014 Vol. 3 p. 106 \u2014 \" he \" lived much in taverns, and Avas equally noted for \" his love of eating and drinking, and the coarseness \" of his manners and conversation\" \u2014 and again p. 144 \u2014 \" his conversation is represented by his contempo \" raries to have been extremely immoral and profane\" \u2014 Malone does not cite any authority for his asser tions ; nor is there any hint in the Biographia Britan nica that the case was as Malone states it \u2014 Malone was the more bound to tell us from Avhat source he borroAved his accusation, as ShadAvell lived at a time when the spirit of party ran very high, and when it may fairly be presumed, that all Avhich was said against Shadwell was not true \u2014 Malone himself observes, that Ave ought not to judge of Dryden's character from the libels of the times \u2014 supposing Malone's assertions to be true, upon Avhat principle can we account for ShadAvell's having inserted such little immorality and"], [51, "41 THOMAS SHADAVELL. profaneness in his plays ? \u2014 he was certainly not re strained by any fear of offending the audience ; and Malone himself Avould hardly have denied that there was less immorality and profaneness in ShadAvell's dramatic Avritings than in those of Dryden. ShadAveU's Epsom Wells and Virtuoso are certainly very indecent, but in the Prologue to the Squire of Alsatia he says \u2014 \" B y the nicest Ladies need not fear, \" The quickest fancy shall extract none here.\" Shadwell has no profaneness, Avhereas Dryden is at times scandalously profane \u2014 let it likewise be re membered that ShadAA'ell's dedications are free from that servile adulation for AvhichDr. Johnson so justly censures Dryden \u2014 Langbaine in 1691 says of Shad well \u2014 \" his dramatic writings are sufficiently knoAvn \" to the world, but especially his excellent comedies : \" Avhich, in the judgment of some persons, have very \" deservedly advanced him to the honour of being \" Poet Laureat; an advancement, Avhichhe confesses, \" is chiefly OAving to the patronage of the Earl of \" Dorset, that great judge of Avitand parts, in Avhose \" favour it has been ShadAveU's particular happiness \" for several years to have had an eminent share * * * \" let me have leave to add, that we are not to measure \" ShadAveU's merit by Dryden's standard, since So \" crates never Avas more persecuted by Aristophanes, \" than ShadAvell by Dryden's pen ; and Avith the same \" injustice : tho' I think, Avhoever shall peruse the \" modest defence of the former, in his epistle to the \" 10th Satire of Juvenal, will not only acquit him, \" but love him for his good humour and gentle tern-"], [52, "42 THOMAS SHADWELL. \" per, to one who endeavoured to destroy his reputa \" tion, so dear to all men, but the very darling of \" poets.\" In the Biographia Britannica it is said of Shadwell \u2014 \"his friend Dr. Brady preached his funeral sermon, \" wherein he assures us, that our author was \u2022 a man \" of great honesty and integrity, and had a real love \" of truth and sincerity, an inviolable fidelity and \" strictness to his word, an unalterable friendship \" wherever he professed it ; and a much deeper \" sense of religion, than many others, Avho pretend \" to it more openly \u2014 his natural and acquired abili \" ties (continues the Doctor) made him sufficiently \" remarkable to all that he conversed with ; very few \" being equal to him, in all the becoming qualities \" and accomplishments of a complete gentleman.\"' Malone does not bring the slightest proof of his assertions\u2014 and, as Dr. Johnson observes, if accusa tion without proof be credited, who shall be innocent? ShadAvell, in his dedication ofthe Libertine to the Duke of NeAvcastle, says, that he had the birth and education, without the fortune of a Gentleman ; and that he had the honour to be daily admitted to his Grace's public and private conversation\u2014 Shadwell was likeAvise intimate with the Earl of Dorset and Sir Charles Sedley\u2014 tAvo of the leading Gentlemen of the times\u2014 such persons surely would not have suffered ShadAvell to keep company Avith them, if his mariners had been coarse. As to the charge of profaneness, it probably arose from Shadwell's detestation of high church principles \u2014it is certain, from the 1st scene of the Lancashire Witches, that Shadwell Avas a low churchman\u2014 it is"], [53, "43 THOMAS SHADWELL. probable from the sentiments Avhich he thus publickly expressed, that he might in conversation speak his mind very freely of the high church party \u2014 but it is hardly possible, that if his conversation had been really and habitually profane, he would not, at one time or other, have been profane in his Avritings. Shadwell is ridiculed by his adversaries for his corpulency, and love of the bottle \u2014 Dryden in his Vindication ofthe Duke of Guise (1683) says \u2014 \"Og \" may write against the King if he pleases, so long \" as he drinks for him ; and his writings will never \" do the government so much harm, as his drinking \" does it good ; for true subjects will not be much \" perverted by his libels ; but the wine duties rise \" considerably by his claret \u2014 He has often called me \" atheist in print ; I Avould believe more charitably \" of him, and that he only goes the broad way, be \" cause the other is too narrow for him * * * by his \" late faU at the Old Devil he broke no ribs, because \" the hardness of the stairs could reach no bones ; \" and for my part I do not wonder how he came to \" fall, for I have always known him heavy : the \" miracle is, how he got up again. I have heard of \" a sea captain as fat as he, who, to escape arrests, \" would lay himself flat upon the ground, and let the \" bailiffs carry him to prison if they could \u2014 if a \" messenger or two, nay, we may put in three or \" four, should come, he has friendly advertisement \" hoAv to escape them.\" By a messenger Dryden means a King's messenger, intimating that Shadwell was liable to be taken up for disaffection to the government."], [54, "44 T. r. 1693. In a Session of the Poets, written about the same time, it is said \u2014 \" Next into the croAvd Tom Shadwell does wallow, \" And swears by his guts, his paunch, and his \" tallow, \" 'Tis he that alone best pleases the age ; \" Himself and his wife have supported the stage. \" HoAvever to please so jovial a wit, \" And to keep him in humour, Apollo thought fit \" To bid him drink on \" &c.

Collier was a most pertinacious disputant, but if Ovid's testimony had been cited against him, he would not have found it very easy to have set it aside. He is extremely angry at the abuse thrown^bn the Clergy on the Stage : and not indeed Avithout some reason, as it is so gross, that it Avould now be con sidered as iUiberal even by those Avho are not over burthened with religion \u2014 he quotes many passages and might have quoted many others \u2014 for instance Dryden in Troilus and Cressida says \u2014 \" Helenus is a \" Priest and keeps a Avhore ; he'll fight for his whore,"], [138, "128 COLLIER. \" or he's no true Priest \"\u2014Troilus is going to kill Thersites, but spares him \u2014 \" Thou hast deserv'd thy life for cursing Priests.\" No one is more scurrilous than Crowne \u2014 in Thy estes the Priest says \u2014 \" Why should we lie?\" Philisthenes.

In the reign of Henry the 4th, Manuel, the Greek Emperour of Constantinople, came into England \u2014 Laonicus Chalcondyles, a Byzantine Historian of the times, in his description of the manners of the English (p. 38 Venetian Edition) says \u2014 \" A very simple \" custom prevails among them as to their wives and children, so \" that when any one by invitation comes into the house of his \" friend, he is received in hospitality after he has first kissed the \" wife \u2014 and in the roads (or streets) they present their wives to \" their friends \u2014 * * * nor do they consider it as a disgrace that <: their wives and daughters should be thus kissed\" Gibbon's interpretation of this passage is \u2014 (Chap 66) \u2014 \" The most singular \" circumstance of their manners is their disregard of conjugal \" honour and female chastity.

Gibbon seems to have been misled, partly by the Latin version, and partly by the pruriency of his own mind, which was ever on the alert in search for indecency\u2014 Porson, in the preface to his letters to Travis, has given a masterly criticism on Gibbon's History, in which, after praising Gibbon in the most handsome manner, he adds\u2014\" A less pardonable fault is that rage for indecency, which \u00ab pervades the whole work, but especially the last volumes\u2014 if the \" history were anonymous, I should guess that these disgraceful \" obscenities were written by some debauchee, who having, from \" age, or accident, or excess, survived the practice of lust, stall \" indulged himself in the luxury of speculation.\" It would be well worth while to compare the last volumes of Gibbon's work with the text of the Byzantine historians."], [141, "131 COLLIER. \" We ha' cheated the Parson, we'll cheat him \" again ; \" For why shou'd a blockhead ha' one in ten ? \" For prating so long like a book-learn'd Sot, \" Till pudding and dumplin burn to pot.\" Collier concludes the whole with long quotations from the Fathers against the Stage, which are nothing to the purpose \u2014 not merely because the Fathers are of no authority (whatever Collier and his party may think) any farther, than as what they say is consonant to reason and good sense ; but because the Theatres in their days were different from what they have been even in the worst of modern times \u2014 Chrysostom speaks of women swimming in the Theatres as a common practice \u2014 and whoever wishes to see the exploits of the Empress Theodora while she was an Actress may find them in a note in Gibbon Ch. 40 \u2014 from which it appears that Nell Gwyn and her asso ciates in their conduct at the Theatre were almost Vestal Virgins in comparison with Theodora. The persons who attempted to answer Collier's book, should have objected to him that Chrysostom used to sleep with Aristophanes under his pillow, as that would have been no bad argument against a man who lays so much stress on the authority of the Fathers \u2014 they should likewise have reminded him that St. Paul did not think it beneath him to quote a verse from the Thais of Menander, as Jerom says \u2014 or from one of Euripides' plays according to Socrates. Collier relates a story from Tertullian, which de serves to be remembered \u2014 A Priest was exorcising a Devil out of a woman and asked him how he dare K 2"], [142, "132 COLLIER. come into a Christian? \"How dare I,\" says the Devil, \" why I caught her on my own ground\u2014 */\u00ab? \" was at the Theatre \" this Collier relates gravely \u2014as a joke, the Repartee of the Devil is a most happy one. Tom Brown says that Tertullian condemned dra matic representations for this wise reason \u2014 the Scrip ture says, we cannot add one cubit to our stature \u2014 but the actors by using buskins attempted to prove the scripture untrue. On the whole Collier is well worth reading, he is sometimes too violent, but he is never dull. On the appearance of his book the Poets of course were up in arms Dryden in the preface to his Fables says\u2014 \"Mr. Collier in many things has taxed \" me justly; and I have pleaded guilty to all thoughts \" and expressions of mine, which can be truly argued \" of obscenity, profaneness, or immorality, and re \" tract them \u2014 if he be my enemy, let him triumph \" \u2014 if he be my friend, as I have given him no per \" sonal occasion to be otherwise, he will be glad of \" my repentance \u2014 yet it were not difficult to prove, \" that in many places he has perverted my meaning \" by his glosses, and interpreted my words into \" blasphemy and obscenity of which they were not \" guilty \u2014 besides he is too much given to horse-play in \" his raillery, and comes to battle like a Dictator from \" the plough \" \u2014 he then makes a witty, but profane re mark, and adds \u2014 \"perhaps it became not one of his \"function to rake into the rubbish of ancient and mo \"dern plays\" \u2014 but how could Collier place the inde cency of the Stage in a striking point of view, without reading the indecent plays ?\u2014 or how could a Clergy-"], [143, "133 COLLIER. man be more in the line of his profession than in writing against Immorality and Profaneness ? Congreve and Vanburgh both Avrote an answer to Collier \u2014 Cibber observes that the former seemed too much hurt to defend himself, and that the latter felt his antagonist so little that he only laughed at his lashes.

He contends that the libertine characters on the stage are often rewarded, seldom punished, and when they are, the correction is strangely gentle and dis proportioned \"just as if a man should be set in the \" Stocks for Murder, or shamed a little for firing a \" town.\" He fights the battle over again about the Clergy, and insists that the addition of Clerk to a person's name is at least equal to that of Gentleman \u2014 but to this it may be replied, that tho' a Gentleman will not be the less a Gentleman for going into Orders, yet it does not by any means follow, that because a man is japanned, he immediately becomes equal to a Gen tleman. In his reply to Vanburgh he is not equally enter taining, but he maintains his cause triumphantly in both Collier adds that Dennis frankly confesses that Lewdness is promoted by the Stage \u2014 on which he observes \" this is clear dealing : and I suppose \" the main reason of his saying that the Play-house \" contributes so much to the happiness of the nation.\""], [144, "134 COLLIER.

Curll, in his History of the Stage 1741, says that the King in the Island Princess was the first part Wilks played at his return to England \u2014 this is an in excusable mistake, as he might have seen in Cibber's Apology that the part was Palamede in Marriage a-la- Mode \u2014 the author ofthe Laureat says \u2014 \"I remember \" I had the pleasure to see Wilks play Palamede -on \" his first appearance after his return from Ireland \u2014 he spoke a Prologue written by Farquhar ; and was \" received with great and general applause.\" Powell seems to have been formed by nature for a first rate actor, but to have ruined himself in a great measure by his negligence and drunkenness \u2014 Cibber acknowledges that Wilks in the part of Palamede, fell short of Powell, and missed a good deal of the loose humour of the character, which the latter hit off more happily\u2014 Powell had from nature much more than Wilks\u2014 in voice and ear, in elocution in Tragedy, and humour in Comedy he had greatly the advantage of him\u2014 yet by his neglect of this natural superiority, he suffered Wilks to be of thrice the service to the * It is sufficiently clear tbat Powell was two seasons at L.

L. his idle example made this fault common to others \u2014 but when Wilks became Stage Manager he was indefatigable himself and took delight in keeping the other actors to their duty \u2014 to be employed on the stage was the delight of his life, and he never left it, till he left the world. (Cibber.) Chetwood says, that Wilks was not only perfect in every part he acted, but in those that were concerned with him in every scene and the author of the Laureat assures us, that he has known Wilks lay a wager and win it, that he would repeat the part of Truewit in the Silent Woman, which consists of 30 lengths, without misplacing a single word. Besides this Wilks had the advantage of a sober character in private life, which Powell not having the least regard to, laboured under the disfavour, not to say contempt of the public, to whom his licentious courses were no secret\u2014 even when he did well, that i. 2"], [158, "148 D.

Cibber begins his play very quietly \u2014 like Homer\u2014 \" Non fumum ex fulgor e, sed ex sumo dare lucem \" Cogitat.\" After some few speeches we are told \u2014 \" King Henry and ill fortune are familiar ; \" He ever threw with an indifferent hand, \" But never yet was known to lose his patience.\" This allusion to the gaming table was very natural in Cibber, the utmost that can possibly be said against it is, that it is an allusion not likely to have come into Lord Stanley's head, as gaming was not so fashionable in his time as in Cibber's. When King Henry enters, he says \u2014 \" Would I were dead, if Heaven's good will were \" so.\" This line is taken from Henry 6th part 3d. o 2"], [206, "196 D.L. 1700 Next comes such a jumble of metaphors as one does not often meet with \u2014 \" When life's but a short chase, our game content, \" Which most pursued, is most compell'd to fly ; \"And he that mounts him on the swiftest hope, \" Shall often run his courser to a stand.\" That the King should not know so distinguished a Nobleman as Lord Stanley is somewhat improbable; particularly as his Father had had several appoint ments under government, and been Chamberlain to the King himself \u2014 (Dugdale) \u2014 nor is it very likely that a Lieutenant of the Tower appointed by Henry the 6th should be continued in office by Edward the 4th, and entrusted with the care of a prisoner of so much consequence Lord Stanley says \u2014 \" The English are high-mettled, Sir, and 'tis \" No easy part to sit 'em well \u2014 King Edward \" Feels their temper, and 'twill be hard to throw \" him.\" Here Cibber seems to compare the English to a high-mettled horse, but it is not easy to comprehend what he means\u2014 the whole scene is wretched till Henry's last speech. When Tressel enters Cibber borrows from Henry 4th, part 2d\u2014 what is said about Priam is so ill timed that it does Shakspeare no credit, and was not worth transplanting\u2014 Dryden observes that no man is at leisure to make sentences and similes when his soul is in an agony \u2014 Shakspeare says of Hotspur \"his \" spirit lent a fire, even to the dullest peasant in his"], [207, "D.

This allusion to the stage is out of character. The description of Prince Edward's death is in part from Henry 6th part 3d \u2014 Shakspeare says \u2014 \" Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York! ####*#**# \" Whilst I propose the self-same words to thee.\" Cibber says \u2014 \" Propose the self-same rebel words to thee.\" It is difficult to conceive what Cibber meant by rebel words -- if he meant rebellious words, this would be in direct opposition to the context \u2014 the Prince of Wales, speaking with his father's mouth, could not speak rebellious words to the Duke of York. \" The self-same words, rebel, to thee\" would be sense. What is said about the frosty Caucasus &c. is from Richard the 2d \u2014 while Cibber was borrowing why did he omit? \" Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite \" By bare imagination of a feast.\" Tho' to say the truth all these lines are too fanciful for a person in Henry's situation \u2014 Richard the 2d says \u2014"], [208, "D.

Hitherto Cibber has not given us any of the ori ginal play \u2014 in Gloster's Soliloquy, which follows, he foolishly omits the first 4 lines \u2014 the conclusion is in part from Henry 6th part 3d \u2014 it would have been better if he had inserted 6 lines more. \" Why I can smile and murder while I smile; \" And cry content to that which grieves my heart; \" And wet my cheeks with artificial tears \" And frame my face to all occasions: \" Can I do this and cannot get a crown? \" Tut ! were it further off, I'll pluck it down.\" Instead of which Cibber gives us 4 poor lines of his own. The scene between the King and Gloster is taken from Henry 6th part 3d \u2014 with the addition of 3 or 4 insipid lines by Cibber \u2014 the Soliloquy is concluded from one of Gloster's in Richard the 3d \u2014 this scene, which Cibber has adopted, is not written in Shak speare's happiest manner, and is inferiour to the scenes which Cibber has omitted the 1st Act of the original play required nothing but curtailment, and some unimportant alterations, but Cibber has omitted Clarence's dream and Queen Margaret's curses, which, as Dr. Warburton observes, are fine and artful\u2014 she prepares the audience, like another Cassandra, for the following Tragic revolutions."], [209, "D. L. 1700. 199 Act 2d begins with an unimportant scene \u2014 Lord Stanley proposes to Tressel to go to Court (where Tressel, as a friend to Henry 6th could have no business) and speaks of Gloster's love to Lady Anne, which he could not possibly know \u2014 in Shakspeare Tressel attends on Lady Anne, but is a mute \u2014 Glos ter enters \u2014 \" 'Twas her excuse to avoid me \u2014 Alas ! \" She keeps no bed \u2014 \" She has health enough to progress far as \" Chertsey, \" Tho' not to bear the sight of me. \" I cannot blame her \u2014 These lines do Cibber credit \u2014 the conclusion of Gloster's speech and what he says about Edward are from Henry 6th part 3d \u2014 then follow some dull lines by Cibber. The first 5 lines of Lady Anne's speech are from Henry 6th part 1st \u2014 what is said of Henry 5th is not at all suitable to Henry 6th \u2014 however as her speech in the Original is in part of it very poor, and as some thing was wanted, they may pass \u2014 Steevens in a note says that Cibber was so thoroughly convinced ofthe ridiculousness and improbability of this scene, that he thought himself obliged to make Tressel say\u2014 \" When future chronicles shall speak of this, \" They will be thought romance, not history.\" If this play were altered so as to leave out this scene, the loss would not be great. \" My dukedom to a beggarly denier.\""], [210, "D. L. 1700. 200 Cibber changes this most absurdly to \u2014 \" My dukedom to a widow's chastity.\" Persons who lay wagers do not lay a dukedom against a quality. In the Soliloquy, Gloster says \u2014 \" But first I'll turn yon' fellow in his grave.\" Cibber foolishly alters this to St. Harry \u2014 he met with the expression in Caryl's English Princess, ox- Death of Richard the 3d, Cibber has improperly omitted the scene with King Edward &c\u2014 to this scene there is a note by Stee vens, which is particularly worth attention, as it com pletely vindicates Milton from a charge which has been repeatedly brought against him \u2014 that of cen suring Charles the 1st for reading Shakspeare\u2014 it appears clearly by the extract which Steevens gives from the Iconoclastes, that Milton does not censure the King for reading Shakspeare. The scene in the original after King Edward's death is but indifferent ; nor has Cibber much im proved it by his alterations or additions. Act 3d \u2014 Shakspeare begins this act with \u2014 \" Welcome, sweet Prince, to London, to your \" chamber.\" On which Pope remarks that London was anciently called the King's Chamber\u2014 this appellation however was not confined to London, as when this same Prince Edward came with his father to Coventry in 1474, St. Edward in a Pageant welcomed him to his cham ber\u2014aee Hist.

(Aside)"], [212, "202 d. l. 1700 Thus the scene might have proceeded with the change of one word only \u2014 mostly for lightly. When the Duke of York enters, Cibber has judi ciously adopted some few lines from a former scene. \"With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons\" &c. These 4 lines, which belong to Buckingham, Cibber has improperly divided between Stanley and Tressel, the latter of whom has no business on the stage at all. When Gloster directs Buckingham to infer the bas tardy of Edward's children, Shakspeare makes Glos ter add \u2014 \" Nay, for a need, thus far come near my per- \" son : \u2014 \" Tell them, when that my mother went with \" child \" Of that insatiate Edivard, noble York,. \" My princely father, then had wars in France ; \" And, by just computation ofthe time, \" Found, that the issue was not his begot.\" Cibber makes Gloster say \u2014 \" Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person ; \" Tell 'em, when my mother went with child \" of me, \" My princely father then had wars in France, \" And by true computation of the time, \" Found, that the issue was not his begot.\" Thus these lines are printed in the grand edition of Cibber's works in 1721\u2014 in the play as printed from the D. L. Prompt-book by Bell in 1773 these lines are omitted\u2014 some person had thc sense to see that"], [213, "D. L. 1700. 203 Cibber had made Gloster attempt to prove himself a bastard instead of his brother. Gloster, according to Cibber, says \u2014 \" Catesby, go thou with speed to Doctor Shaw, \" and thence \" To Fryer Beuker \" \u2014 the folio edition calls this Friar, Peuker \u2014 his name was properly Pinker or Penker \u2014 he was Provincial of the Augustine Monks and a popular man \u2014 Dr. Shaw was a famous preacher and brother to the Lord Mayor \u2014 see Rapin for the account of the Ser mon he preached at St. Paul's, and the Farce con certed between him and the Duke of Gloster, which the Duke spoilt by not entering at his cue. Gloster concludes the scene with a Soliloquy of above 20 lines \u2014 this may be considered as the acme of Cibber's poetry \u2014 it would be doing him injustice not to quote a part of it. \"Conscience! 'tis our coin, we live by parting \" with it ; \" And he thrives best, that has the most to spare. \" The protesting lover buys hope with it, \" And the deluded virgin short liv'd pleasure ; \" Old Greybeards cram their avarice with it. \" Your lank-jawed hungry judge will dine upon't, \" And hang the guiltless, rather than eat his mut- \" ton cold.\" &c. A great deal has in this act been omitted about Hastings, part of which Rowe has borrowed, and put into Jane Shore. The beginning of the next scene, according to"], [214, "204 d. l. noo. Cibber, is stupid enough, notwithstanding the soft music\u2014 when Gloster enters, the dialogue between him and Lady Anne is Cibber's, and not bad. Buckingham's account of what had passed at Guildhall and the scene with the Mayor &c. is not materially altered. \" When holy and devout religious men \" Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them \" thence, \" So sweet is zealous contemplation.\" Who but Cibber would have omitted these 3 lines? \u2014 the act concludes with a contemptible Soliloquy by Gloster. Act 4th \u2014 the 1st scene of this act in the original play is bad \u2014 it required alteration, but Cibber has not altered it happily \u2014 he attempts to be pathetic, but is not very successful. In both the plays Gloster gives orders that no per son should be admitted to the Princes \u2014 this being done, Shakspeare with his usual judgment places the 1st scene of this act before the Tower, and the Queen is refused to see her children \u2014 Cibber with his usual impropriety places the scene in the Tower, and the Queen seems to have gained admission without any difficulty \u2014 she is even so absurd as to attempt to take the young Princes away with her, just as if they had been common children \u2014 Cibber's additions to this scene are poor stuff. When the King proposes to Buckingham to mur der his nephews, all is so well written, that no man who had a grain of modesty would have made any alteration \u2014 but Cibber makes some changes for the"], [215, "D. L. 1700. 205 worse\u2014 if any one has a doubt of Cibber's stupidity, let him compare this short part of the scene with the original \u2014 Richard, in Shakspeare, says \u2014 \" Ah, Buckingham, now do I play the touch, \" To try if thou be current gold, indeed.\" Cibber ruins the Metaphor by changing gold to friend \u2014 but the keeping up of a Metaphor with propriety, is a thing of which Cibber had not the most distant notion \u2014 not content with this he adds 5 lines of his own, and more contemptible lines have seldom been written \u2014 \" I tell thee, cuz, I've lately had two spiders \" Crawling upon my startled hopes \u2014 now tho' \" Thy friendly hand has brush'd 'em from me, \" Yet still they crawl offensive to my eyes ; \" I wou'd have some friend to tread upon 'em.\" Cibber, (p. 89 of his Apology) in censuring Lee's rant about the passing of the Granicus, observes \u2014 \" If Le Brun, who was famous for painting the \" battles of Alexander, had seen this lofty description, \" what one image could he have possibly taken from \" it? in what colours would he have shewn us Glory \" perch'd upon a beaver ? how would he have drawn \"Fortune trembling?\" Sec. \u2014 Cibber's criterion is not a bad one \u2014 and if, in one of the editions of his play, he had favoured us with a frontispiece to re present Spiders crawling on hopes \u2014 we should have been vastly obliged to him. Tyrrel is improperly omitted, and the remainder of the scene is badly altered. In the next scene Shakspeare has given Tyrrel"], [216, "206 D. L. 1700. a good soliloquy\u2014 this Cibber omits, and gives the King a poor soliloquy in exchange \u2014 in Shakspeare, Tyrrel says the Chaplain of the Tower had buried the young princes but he does not know where \u2014 in Cibber, Tyrrel says he thought to ask the King's pleasure as to the burial \u2014 the King answers \u2014 \" I have it \u2014 I'll have 'em sure \u2014 get me a coffin \" Full of holes, let 'em be both cramm'd into it, \" And hark thee, in the night-tide throw 'em down \" The Thames \u2014 once in, they'll find the way to \" the bottom.\" In 1674 some bones were found in the Tower, which were judged to be those of the two princes, they were in consequence put into a marble urn, and buried among the Kings at Westminster Abbey \u2014 (Rapin) \u2014 which would hardly have been done, if the Thames story had been considered as entitled to any degree of credit. The long scene between Richard and the Queen, in the original, is one of the worst that Shakspeare ever wrote \u2014 Dr. Johnson says part of it is ridiculous, and the whole improbable \u2014 Cibber properly retains but a small part of it \u2014 his own additions are flat enough \u2014 after the Queen's exit, Ratcliff tells the King that Richmond is off the coast \u2014 Shakspeare says \u2014 K.

Dr. Johnson observes that Richard's precipitation and confusion in this scene is very happily represented by inconsistent orders and sudden variations of opi nion Cibber omits nearly the whole of this and sends Catesby coldly with a message to the Duke of Norfolk \u2014 that Cibber as a writer should be insensible of the merit of these lines is not surprising, but that as an Actor he should not see how much these sudden transitions were in favour of the person who was to play Richard, is really wonderful."], [218, "208 d. l. 1700. In the following scene with Stanley there was little need of change, but Cibber omits 5 good lines, and as usual alters for the worse\u2014 when Stanley says that Richmond means to claim the crown \u2014 Richard replies \u2014 \" Is the chair empty ? is the sword unsway'd ? \" Is the king dead ? the empire unpossess'd ? \" What heir of York is there alive, but we ? \" And who is England's king, but great York's \" heir? \" Then, tell me, what makes he upon the seas ? \" A 3d Messenger enters and says \u2014 My Lord, the army of great Buckingham \u2014 K.

Richard's speech when he wakes, as Dr. Johnson observes, has something in it very trifling and some thing very striking \u2014 alteration was therefore necessary, but the less the better Cibber gives it thus \u2014 \" Give me a horse \u2014 bind up my wounds ! \" Have mercy Heav'n ! ha ! soft ! 'twas but a \" dream ; \" But then so terrible it shakes my soul : \" Cold drops of sweat hang on my trembling flesh ; \" My blood grows chilly, and I freeze with horror: \" O Tyrant conscience! how dost thou afflict me? \" When I look back, 'tis terrible retreating ; \" I cannot bear the thought, nor dare repent : \" I am but man ; and Fate, do thou dispose me \u2014 \" Who's there ?\" Enter Catesby.

Dr. Warburton in a note says \u2014 \"the players, among \" their other innumerable absurdities in the represen \" tation of this tragedy, make Richard say, instead \" of ' O coward conscience, O tyrant conscience !

In Shakspeare, Richmond wakes \u2014 Oxford &c. enter \u2014 Richmond addresses his troops \u2014 his speech might have been shortened to advantage \u2014 but no other change was wanted. Henry the 5th says \u2014 act 3 scene 1 \u2014 \" In peace, there's nothing so becomes a man, \" As modest stillness, and humility : \" But when the blast of war blows in our ears, \" Then imitate the action of the tyger.\" Cibber makes Richmond speak these lines \u2014 taking care however to alter the 2d of them without any good reason \u2014 and the 4th, much for the worse \u2014 \" Let us be tygers in our fierce deportment.\" The word then, which corresponds to when, should on no account have been omitted. In Shakspeare, Richard, Ratcliff &c. re-enter \u2014 in this short scene not one syllable should have been altered, till Norfolk enters, then some curtailment of the scene would have been proper \u2014 Cibber makes two absurd changes \u2014 in Shakspeare, Richard calls Richmond's followers \" a scum of Brittains \" \u2014 that is of persons born in Bretagne \u2014 Cibber confounds this distinction, and says \" a scum of Britons.\" Shakspeare makes Richard say \u2014 \" Our ancient word of courage, fair St. George, \" Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons \" Upon them ! \u2014 Victory sits on our helms.\" This Cibber changes to \u2014"], [223, "D.L. 1700. 213 \" And thou, our warlike Champion, thrice re- \" nown'd \" St. George, inspire me. with the rage of lions : \" Upon 'em \u2014 Charge \u2014 follow me.\" The whole legend of St. George is silly enough, (see C. G. Jan. 21 1778) but the mention of St. George naturally put Shakspeare in mind of his dragon, whereas there is no connexion between St. George and lions. In the field of battle, Richard has some few lines given him from Henry the 6th part 2d \u2014 when he calls for a horse \u2014 Shakspeare makes Catesby say \u2014 \" Withdraw, my Lord, I'll help you to a horse.\" Instead of which Cibber gives us three flat lines \u2014 Catesby was not likely to prose at such a time, nor Richard to suffer him, if he had been so inclined. The short dialogue between Richard and Richmond is altered from Henry 6th part 2 \u2014 the last 6 lines of the dying speech are spoken by Northumberland in the 1st scene of Henry 4th part 2d. The joy which Cibber makes Richmond express at hearing the fair Elizabeth is coming to congratulate him, is absurd to the last degree, as his was a mere political match, and nothing but his engagements, which were too strong to be broken through, induced him reluctantly to marry her. Caryl's play differs so widely from Shakspeare's that Cibber could make but very little use of it, from thence however he has borrowed that beauty which he repeatedly bestows on Elizabeth, and of which, history and Shakspeare know but little \u2014 Caryl says \u2014"], [224, "214 d. l. 1700. \" In this day's booty they the crown have found, \" Behold the noblest spoil of Bosworth Field.\" Cibber\u2014 \" Among the glorious spoils of Bosworth field \" We've found the Crown.\" Caryl makes Richmond say to Richard \u2014 \" How great thy fame had been, hadst thou been \" good.\" This is well expressed \u2014 but it seems to have been a maxim with Cibber that to dilate a thought was to improve it \u2014 \" Had thy aspiring soul but stirr'd in virtue, \" With half the spirit it has dar'd in evil, \" How might thy fame have grae'd our English \" Annals!\" Downes mentions Richard the 3d as one of Bet terton's best characters \u2014 the English Princess might probably continue on the acting list while rhyming tragedies were in fashion, but it does not appear that Shakspeare's play, or any alteration of it, had been acted between 1660 and 1700. Cibber to crown all, acted Richard himself\u2014 his action in Tragedy is said in general to have been bad \u2014 and as it is well known that his voice was a weak one, we need no Ghost come from the grave to tell us that he was unfit for Richard \u2014 he says himself that Sandford was peculiarly qualified to have played the part, and that he acted it in Sandford's manner,"], [225, "D.

Dr. Johnson with his usual judgment observes \u2014 \" this is one of the most celebrated of Shakspeare's \" performances ; yet I know not whether it has not \" happened to him as to others, to be praised most, \" when praise is not most deserved \u2014 that this play \" has scenes noble in themselves and very well con \" trived to strike in exhibition cannot be denied \u2014 \" but some parts are trifling, others shocking, and \" some improbable.\" Generally speaking, the only mode of altering Shakspeare's plays with propriety is, to omit the weak parts \u2014to transpose, where transposition may be made to advantage \u2014 and to add some few lines when necessary \u2014 in this play something more was requisite \u2014 and if Cibber had contented himself with modestly altering those scenes, which are least worthy of the author and yet essential to the plot, he would have made him \" a dish fit for the Gods, and not \" have hewed him as a carcase fit for hounds.\" Whoever attempts to adapt an old play to the stage, more especially one of Shakspeare's, should lay it down as a rule, to make no alteration, but what is necessary or at least expedient \u2014 whereas Cibber changes out of mere wantonness \u2014 the alterations which he makes, without rhyme or reason, are more than any body Avould believe, who had not compared the two plays \u2014to enumerate them would be tiresome. One has no wish to disturb Cibber's own Trage dies in their tranquil graves, but while our indigna tion continues to be excited by the frequent represen tation of Richard the 3d in so disgraceful a state,"], [226, "216 d. l. 1700. there can be no peace between the friends of unso phisticated Shakspeare and Cibber. The Editor of Bell's Shakspeare observes, that this Tragedy is admirably altered by that excellent judge and ornament ofthe stage, Colley Cibber \u2014 Q,g oan tou opoiov aya Stog tag tov o/riotov. Homer. In the tent scene this able Commentator says that Cibber has brought the Ghosts on the stage but once, tho' Shakspeare had introduced them twice \u2014 it would have been as well if he had taken the trouble just to have looked into the original play, and seen if the fact were as he stated it, or not. It would not be difficult to make a much better alteration of this play than Cibber has made \u2014 what he has done well, or even decently, might be left as it is \u2014 the passages from the 3 parts of Henry the 6th might be retained, if that should be judged expe dient \u2014 but the speeches from Henry 4th and Henry 5th should be sent back to their proper places \u2014 except perhaps the dying speech, which Cibber has adopted with infinitely more judgment than any thing else that he has borrowed \u2014 Richard the 3d itself has plenty of materials for 5 acts. The Public has been so long used to Cibber's play, that such an alteration would probably be as coolly received as Colman's Lear \u2014 however it would be worth while to try the experiment.* To the advocates for Cibber's Richard I only wish * The experiment was made at C. G. March 12. 1821."], [227, "217 D. L. 1700. to make one request \u2014 that they would never say a syllable in favour of Shakspeare. Malone observes that proportionate to our respect and veneration for Shakspeare ought to be our care of his fame and of those valuable writings he has left us; and our solicitude to preserve them pure and unpolluted by any modern sophistication, or foreign admixture whatsoever. Davies exposes himself to the last degree of con tempt from the real friends of Shakspeare, when (in page 3d ofthe 1st Vol. of his Dramatic Miscellanies) he says, Cibber in his Richard the 3d has very dex terously made up a very pleasing pasticcio from a diligent perusal of all Shakspeare's historical plays, scarcely making use of a line or thought which was his own. Even Murphy (in his life of Garrick p. 21) says, that the new matter introduced by Cibber was, with great judgment, selected from Shakspeare himself. Fielding, who with so much wit and judgment exposed Cibber's presumption with regard to King John, seems to have said nothing against his Richard the 3d. Dr. Valpy, in the advertisement prefixed to his alteration of King John, says \u2014 \" Cibber succeeded \" in his alteration of Richard the 3d, because he \" collected a Cento of Shakspeare's expressions and \" speeches.\" Garrick concludes the Prologue to the Desart Island with a line which he had often spoken as Richard \u2014 \" A little flattery sometimes does well.\""], [228, "218 d. l. 1700. It is strongly to be suspected that he thought he was quoting Shakspeare.* As Porson says on a different occasion, if the per sons who have only read Cibber's Richard the 3d were divided into companies of ten, and if every one who had read the original play were to wait upon a company, many decads would go without a cupbearer. The author of the Laureat says \u2014 \" the play of \" Richard the 3d was altered from Shakspeare; that \" is, it was vamped up by a modern poetical botcher, \" who, besides mangling and leaving out many beau \" tiful and just images in the original, had pillaged \" his other plays to enrich this one \u2014 when it came to \" be acted, this mender of Shakspeare chose the \" part of Richard for himself, and screamed through \" 4 acts without dignity or decency : the audience, \" ill-pleased with the Farce, accompanied him with \" a smile of contempt ; but in the 5th act, he dege \" nerated all at once into Sir Novelty ; and when in \" the heat of the battle at Bosworth Field, the King \" is dismounted, our Comic- Tragedian came on the \" stage, really breathless, and in a seeming panick, \" screaming out this line thus \u2014 A Harse, a Harse, \" my kingdom for a Harse \u2014 this highly delighted \" some and disgusted others of his auditors ; and \" when he was killed by Richmond, one might plainly \" perceive that the good people were not better \" pleased that so execrable a tyrant was destroyed, * A similar mistake occurs in a \" Cure for Romance \" 1819 \" Does not our Shakspeare say, Fathers have flinty hearts \" cer tainly not ; this half line was added to Romeo and Juliet by Gar rick."], [229, "L.

At the latter end of the last year, or the beginning of this, Betterton, who had before revived Henry 8th, revived Henry 4th \u2014 the Wits of all qualities (says a Contemporary) have lately entertained themselves with a revived humour of Sir John Falstaff in Henry 4th, which has drawn all the town more than any new play that has been produced of late, which shows that Shakspeare's wit will always last : and the Critics allow that Betterton has hit the humour of Falstaff better than any that have aimed at it before.

Act 1st \u2014 the first scene is greatly curtailed and altered for the worse \u2014the scene between Portia and Nerissa is likewise badly altered \u2014 one of Granville's elegant additions deserves to be quoted \u2014 Portia says if she should be forced to marry the Dutchman she should become \" La Signora Gutts ! oh hideous ! \" what a sound will that be in the mouth of an Ita \" han?\" \u2014 when Shylock enters the scene is not ma terially altered. Act 2d \u2014 the characters of Launcelot and Gobbo are totally omitted \u2014 the act begins with Shylock's telling Jessica that he is invited out to supper \u2014 Jessica elopes with Lorenzo \u2014 then comes an Enter tainment at Bassauio's \u2014 the Masque of Peleus and Thetis is introduced, by way of bribing the audience, and making Shakspeare go down more palatably \u2014 this scene of course is Granville's, except that he makes Bassanio speak what Lorenzo says about Music in the 5th act of the original \u2014 Dr. Johnson says, the Masque has here and there a pretty line, but it is not always melodious, and the conclusion is wretched.

Act 4th is not materially altered\u2014 but some lines are most injudiciously omitted \u2014 Bassanio speaks part of what belongs to Gratiano \u2014 he offers Shylock the whole of his own body instead of the single pound of flesh due from Antonio \u2014 and, lastly, draws his sword (a likely circumstance in a Court of Justice) to defend his friend.

Rowe in the preface to his Lady Jane Gray says, that Smith had designed to write a play on the same subject, and that Smith's papers had been put into his hands, but that he could not take from them more than 30 lines at the most \u2014 he adds \u2014 \" I should \" have made no scruple of taking 3, 4, or even the \" whole 5 acts from him ; but then I hope I should \" have had the honesty to let the world know they \" were his, and not take another man's reputation \" to myself.\" On Jan. 5. 1825 the Fatal Dowry was revived at D.

Act 2d \u2014 When the Funeral Procession enters, the scene is on the whole improved, as Massinger had inserted some contemptible comic speeches \u2014 yet there is an indecorum in making Rochfort offer his daughter to Charalois at such a time \u2014 Massinger has managed this much better.

Betterton and his associates seem to have been very successful for some few years after their removal to L. I. F. \u2014 but about this time their affairs began to decline owing to a variety of causes \u2014 they were too old to mend in their acting, whereas their com petitors were greatly improved \u2014 the theatre was but small and poorly fitted up \u2014 their system of manage ment which had been hastily formed, deprived Bet terton of that authority, which is necessary for any person who undertakes to govern a company \u2014 he often complained to Booth of the difficulties he laboured under in this respect \u2014 and the novelties of French Tumblers &c. introduced at D.

L.\" If Betterton's influence with Bowman, who had married his adopted daughter, was so small, what must it have been with the rest of the company ? Betterton to gratify the desires and fancies of the Nobility and Gentry engaged from abroad the best dancers and singers, but they, being exorbitantly ex pensive, procured small profit to him and his company, but vast gain to themselves. (Doivnes.) To recover to Betterton and his friends their due estimation a new project was formed, that of building them a stately theatre in the Haymarket \u2014 Capt. Vanburgh opened a subscription for that purpose, M'hich was filled by 30 persons of quality at \u00a3100 each, in consideration whereof every Subscriber for his life was to be admitted, to whatever entertainments should be publickly performed there, without farther payment for his entrance \u2014 (Cibber.) \u2014 while this plan was in agitation, it was suggested to Betterton, that he should assign over to Vanburgh his License to"], [323, "d. l. 1704-1705. 313 perform \u2014 and for the future have no concern with the theatre but as an actor \u2014 to this he readily assented \u2014 he had now been on the stage above 40 years, and found the infirmities of age beginning to make inroads on his constitution \u2014 he was therefore desirous of repose and of being relieved from the fatigues of management \u2014 in the latter end of 1704 he assigned over his license and his whole company to Vanburgh. (B. D. and Downes.) D. L. 1704-1705. Christopher Rich got a footing in this theatre March 24th 1690-91 by Alexander Davenant assign ing to him all his interest in that theatre, which in 1687 he derived from a similar assignment made to him by Charles Davenant, probably his brother \u2014 and from that time Rich had been considered as the prin cipal Manager there \u2014 In the dedication of the World in^the Moon to him in 1697. that piece which was acted at D. G., is said to have been played under his own roof\u2014 this information we derive from Malone, but neither he nor Cibber gives a satisfactory account how Rich who had only a certain interest (tho' a large one) in the theatre, contrived to act as sole Proprietor"], [324, "314 d. l. 1704-1705. \u2014 Cibber indeed explains the arts by which he main tained himself in that authority, but not how he acquired it originally \u2014 he appears to have been a man of great cunning, and intimately acquainted with all the quirks of law \u2014 he was as sly a tyrant as was ever at the head of a theatre, for he gave the actors more liberty, and fewer days pay than any of his prede cessors \u2014 he would laugh with them over a bottle and bite them in their bargains\u2014 he kept them poor, that they might not be able to rebel, and sometimes merry, that they might not think of it. The Company which had been left at D. L. on the secession of Betterton and his associates, after strug- gling with unequal force against those excellent per- formers, began in the course of a few years to remove the prejudices which had been entertained against them, and to claim their share of applause \u2014they had the advantage of youth ; and having had the oppor- tunity of exhibiting themselves in several new plays, where comparisons to their disadvantage could not be made, they came to be viewed in a more favourable light \u2014 by the acquisition of Mrs. Oldfield and Wilks, and the visible improvement of Cibber, Pinkethman, Johnson and Bullock, the reputation of the company was by this time much greater than in 1695 \u2014 all the credit of this was due to the performers and none to the Patentee, who had no conception himself of theatrical merit either in authors or actors \u2014 yet his judgment was governed by a saving rule in both \u2014 he looked into his receipts for the value of a play, and from common fame he judged of his actors \u2014 he had purchased his share of the Patent solely with a view to make money by it \u2014 his taste about every thing to"], [325, "d. l. 1704-1705. 315 be exhibited on the stage was just upon a level with that of the multitude, whose opinion and whose money weighed with him full as much as that of the best judges \u2014 he earned this notion so far that he was once actually in treaty for an extraordinary large Elephant, who was to make his appearance at Dorset Garden in any play or farce at a certain sum \u2014 but from the jealousy which so formidable a rival had raised in his dancers, and by his bricklayer's assuring him, that if the walls were to be opened wide enough for his entrance, it might endanger the fall of the house, he gave up this project. Such was the conduct of the Patentee, nor was it easily to be altered, while he possessed the secret of making money out of disorder and confusion \u2014 for however strange it may appear Cibber had often ob served him inclined to be cheerful in the distresses of his theatrical affairs, and equally reserved and pensive, when things went smoothly forward with a visible profit \u2014 upon a run of good audiences he was more frightened to be thought a gainer, which would make him accountable to others, than he was dejected with bad houses, which at worst he knew would make others accountable to him. (Cibber.) As so much has been said against Rich (and seem ingly with good reason) it would be unfair not to notice what has been said in his favour. The Stage Beaux tossed in a Blanket was printed in 1704 \u2014 the author in his dedication to Rich says \u2014 \" I should here make a panegyric on your several \" good qualities ; but I know by that I should rather \" offend than please you, who are much fonder of \" doing good deeds, than of hearing of them when"], [326, "316 d.

(Dryden.) Dr. Johnson calls this a scholar's play ; but how can this be said with propriety of a T. in which the author has followed Racine rather than Euripides or Seneca ? If it be alleged that Hippolytus would not do on the English Stage in his real character as a woman hater, the answer is easy, Smith should have recol lected what Horace says of Homer \u2014 \" Qu\u00e6 \" Desperat tractata nitescere posse, relinquit.\" In the 1st scene of the 3d act Ph\u00e6dra says to Lycon \" Has happy Ph\u00e6dra aught \" In the wide circle of her far stretch'd empire \"&c.

Cibber is very near right in both his statements, as the union really took place in 1 707-8, but the appa rent contradiction between his two accounts puzzled me exceedingly till I saw the playbills\u2014 for who would have imagined that the union commenced in the middle of a season? \u2014 the bills are always of great importance, but never more so than on this occasion.

The old Patentee having regained the dominion of the theatre, instead of profiting by past experience, and endeavouring to conciliate the regards of the actors, returned to his former oppressive behaviour towards them \u2014 some were reduced in their pay, Cibber and others were threatened with the same fate \u2014 but the most material grievance, which they all had to complain of, was in regard to their benefits. During the reign of King Charles, an actor's benefit had never been heard of \u2014 the first indulgence of this kind was given to Mrs. Barry in King James' time in consideration of her extraordinary merit \u2014 but there this favour rested to her alone ; till after the division of the Company in 1695, at which time the Patentees were soon reduced to pay their actors half in good words and half in ready money \u2014 in this precarious condition, some particular actors compounded for their arrears by taking the chance of a benefit play \u2014 in a year or two these benefits grew so advantageous, that they became at last the chief article of every actor's agreement \u2014 now tho' the agreements of the actors on their return to D. L. were only verbal, yet that made no difference in the honest obligation to keep them \u2014 but honour was a thing about which the Patentees did not much trouble themselves \u2014 no actor therefore could have his benefit fixed this season, till he had first signed a paper signifying his voluntary acceptance of it, on condition of paying one third to the Patentees, any claims from custom to the contrary, notwithstanding \u2014 the actors were"], [433, "d. l. 1708-1709. 423 forced to comply with what they considered the se verest injury, but they applied to the Lord Chamber lain for redress \u2014 the Patentees were warned at their peril to refuse the actors full satisfaction \u2014 they de murred \u2014 and an order for Silence was sent to the theatre \u2014 Swiney had permission to enter into a treaty with such of the actors at D.

They complained of the interference of the Lord Chamberlain, and stated in particular, that orders had been sent from his Lordship in Nov. and Dec. 1705 to the Patentees and their managers, players and performers, relating to the establishing of ano ther playhouse ; and restraining the petitioners' power to treat with such actors as they should think neces sary to their business other orders were sent them in Dec. and Jan. 1707* for restraining the petitioners from acting any Operas, and from employing such persons as they conceived fit for dancing and singing, under the penalty of silencing. On April 30 1709 the petitioners' treasurer was ordered to pay monies to their actors, without their consent or agreement ; and on the 6th of June last, the petitioners and actors were silenced for not so doing. They added, that such orders were, as the peti tioners were advised, contrary to the rights and pri vileges conveyed by the Patents, and tended to subvert the same and destroy the property of those claiming under them \u2014 and as the petitioners were refused redress by the Lord Chamberlain, although they frequently applied for the same, they at last had recourse to her Majesty and prayed relief from the said orders. Another petition was presented to the Queen signed by B. Booth, Theo. Keene, Jno. Bickerstaffe, * That is on the re-union in Jan. 1708. N.S."], [437, "d. l. 1709-1710. 427 Fran. Leigh, Hen.

Rich seems to have imagined that the order of silence, like others of the same kind, would be re called of course, after a reasonable obedience had been paid to it ; he therefore for some time kept together such actors, as had not been invited to the Hay. or preferred following the fortune of D. L the principal of these was Booth. When it appeared that the Lord Chamberlain was resolved not to revoke the order of silence, William Collier, Esquire (one of the Petitioners) who was a Lawyer of an enterprising head, Member for Truro, and from his convivial qualities a favourite with the persons in power, obtained a License for himself. His next object was to get possession of D. L. Theatre. Rich still kept it in his hands without making use of it, and was not obliged to pay rent unless he actuaUy did use it ; Collier therefore con ceived it would be the interest of the joint landlords to grant a lease to one who had an undoubted autho rity to act plays, and who by so doing would be liable to pay the rent, especially as he tempted them with an offer of raising it from \u00a33 to \u00a34 a day \u2014 his pro ject succeeded, the lease was signed, but the means of getting into possession were left to his own discretion \u2014 this he effected by the assistance of a rabble \u2014 Rich however had gotten intelligence of his design"], [439, "d. l. 1709-1710. 429 time enough to carry off every thing that was worth moving, except a number of old scenes.

The Life of Betterton by an anonymous author was published in 1710 with a dedication to Richard Steele Esquire \u2014 this is generally attributed to Gildon \u2014 it consists of 176 pages, more than 150 of which have nothing to do with Betterton \u2014 Gildon gives a list of 73 plays in which Betterton acted, but he does not tell us in what character \u2014 consequently it is im possible to say with certainty what parts he acted in about 15 of the plays \u2014 Gildon adds that Betterton acted in many others too long to insert \u2014 if Gildon had made his Jist of plays as complete as he might have done, and had mentioned Betterton's parts, his book would have been of great value \u2014 as it is, it is but of little. Downes mentions as his best parts \u2014 Pericles \u2014 Bondman \u2014 C\u00e6sar Borgia \u2014 Loyal Subject \u2014 Mad Lover \u2014 Richard the 3d \u2014 King Lear \u2014 Solyman the Magnificent \u2014 Hamlet \u2014 Macbeth \u2014 Timon of Athens \u2014 Othello \u2014 \u0152dipus \u2014 Jaffier \u2014 Henry 8th \u2014 Falstaff. Cibber says, that after Mountfort had acted Alex ander with success for several years, Betterton, on his death, took the part, and acted it with so new a lustre, that it filled the house for three days together \u2014 he particularly commends Betterton in Othello \u2014 Hamlet \u2014 Hotspur \u2014 Macbeth and Brutus. Anthony Aston says \u2014 \" Betterton (although a su \" perlative good actor) labour'd under an ill figure, \" being clumsily made, having a great head, a short \" thick neck, stoop'd in the shoulders, and had fat \" short arms, which he rarely lifted higher than his \" stomach \u2014 his left hand frequently lodged in his \" breast, between his coat and waistcoat, while, with \" his right, he prepar'd his speech\u2014 his actions were"], [467, "hay. 1709-1710. 457 \" few, but just \u2014 he had little eyes, and a broad face, \"a little pock-fretten, a corpulent body, and thick \" legs, with large feet \u2014 he was better to meet, than \" to follow ; for his aspect was serious, venerable, \" and majestic ; in his latter time a little paralytic \" \u2014 his voice was low and grumbling ; yet he could \" tune it by an artful climax, which enforc'd universal \" attention, even from the fops and orange-girls \u2014 he \" was incapable of dancing, even in a country-dance; \" as was Mrs. Barry \u2014 but their good qualities were \" more than equal to their deficiences \u2014 while Mrs. \" Bracegirdle sung very agreeably in the Loves of \" Mars and Venus, and danced in a country-dance \" as well as Wilks, though not with so much art and \" foppery, but like a well-bred gentlewoman * * * \" Betterton was the Ph\u0153nix of the stage \u2014 the most \" extensive actor from Alexander to Falstaff * * * \" I have often wished that he would have resigned \" the part of Hamlet to some young actor, who might \" have personated, tho' not have acted it, better \u2014 \" but no one else could have pleased the town, he \" was so rooted in their opinion \u2014 his younger cotem \" porary, (Betterton 63, Powell 40 years old) PoweU, \" attempted several of Betterton's parts, as Alexander, \" Jaffier, &c. but lost his credit ; as, in Alexander, \" he maintain'd not the dignity of a King, but Out \" Heroded Herod ; and in his poison'd, mad scene, \" out-rav'd all probability ; while Betterton kept his \" passion under, and show'd it most (as fume smokes \" most) when stifled. Betterton, from the time he \" was dress'd, to the end of the play, kept his mind \" in the same temperament and adaptness, as the \" present character required \u2014 if I was to write of"], [468, "458 hay. 1709-1710. \" him all day, I should still remember fresh matter \" in his behalf.\" Betterton was a dramatic writer, but most ofthe plays attributed to him were merely alterations \u2014 he was kind and friendly both to authors and actors \u2014 Booth always spoke of him with respect and venera tion ; and he was of great service to Booth by his instructions.

Collier, at the close of the last season, finding that the direction of the Opera did not turn out so good a post as he expected, and observing the prosperity of the Theatre, began to meditate an exchange of situation with Swiney, who had visibly very fair pretensions to that he was in, by his being first chosen by the Court to rescue the stage from the disorders it had suffered under its former Managers \u2014 yet Collier knew that sort of merit could stand in no competition with his in being a Member of Par- liament\u2014he had therefore recourse to his interest at Court (where mere will and pleasure was the only law that disposed of Theatrical rights) to oblige Swi- ney to let him be off from his bad bargain for a bet- ter \u2014 to this it may be imagined that Swiney demur- red, and, as he had reason, strongly remonstrated against it \u2014 but as Collier had listed his conscience under the command of interest, he kept it to strict duty and was immoveable ; insomuch that Vanburgh, who was a friend to Swiney, and, who by his* inti- macy with the people in power, better knew the mo- tive of their actions, advised Swiney rather to accept of the change, than by a non-compliance to hazard his being excluded from any post or concern in either of the Theatres \u2014 in short, it was not long before Collier had procured a new Licence for himself, Wilks, Dogget and Cibber, exclusive of Swiney, who by this new regulation was reduced to his Hobson's choice of the Opera \u2014 Collier likewise drove his part ners to the last inch of a hard bargain (the natural"], [496, "486 d l. 1711-1712. consequence of all treaties between power and neces sity) and forced them to make his share a Sinecure of \u00a3700 a year.

The Spectator for Jan. 1st 1711-12 contains an advertisement from him to say that he should on that day open the Bumper Tavern in James Street C. G, and that his wines would be sold wholesale and retail with the utmost fidelity by his oki servant Trusty Antony (probably Anthony Aston) who had so often adorned both the Theatres in England and Ireland \u2014 he does not give the least intimation that he means to leave the stage.

Perhaps the most exceptionable passage in the whole play is that in which Cato expresses an appre hension that he has been too hasty in killing himself \u2014 the sentiment is very proper in itself, but it is the sentiment of Addison, not of Cato \u2014 Cato neither had, nor could have any doubt on the point, as it was a maxim of the Stoicks, that it was often the duty of a wise man to depart out of life \u2014 the Epicureans ex pressed their opinion by an allusion to the Theatre \u2014 \" if you do not like the part assigned you on the \" Stage of life, make your exit \" Cicero makes Cato himself say \u2014 S\u00e6pe offcium est sapientis descis cere a vita, si id opportune facere possit \u2014 and he says of Cato \u2014 Sic abiit e vita, ut causam moriendi nactum se esse gauderet \u2014 vetat enim dominans ille in nobis Deus injussu hinc nos suo demigrare\u2014cum vero cau sam justam Deus ipse dederit, ut tune Socrati, nunc Catoni * * * n\u00e6 ille * * tanquam a deo evocatus atque emissus exierit.

D'Urfey had been the delight of the most polite companies from the beginning of Charles the second's reign to that time, yet tho' an universal favourite, towards the close of his life, he stood in need of as sistance to prevent his passing the remainder of it in a cage like a singing bird ; for after having written more Odes than Horace and about 4 times as many Comedies as Terence, he found himself reduced to great difficulties by the importunities of a set of men, who of late years had furnished him with the accom modations of life, and would not, as we say, be paid with a song ! \u2014 Addison said this in No. 67 of the Guardian, and recommends him to the public notice, observing that he remembered King Charles leaning on Tom D'Urfey's shoulder more than once, and humming over a song with him \u2014 and that many an honest Gentleman had gotten a reputation in the country by pretending to have been in company with Tom D'Urfey \u2014 in No. 82 Steele reminds his readers that the Fond Husband was to be acted for his old friend's benefit that day, adding that Charles the 2d"], [527, "517 d.

D'Urfey wrote or altered 29 plays which were acted \u2014besides 3 which he printed in 1721, and which were never acted \u2014 He has sometimes been spoken of with a contempt which his writings did not deserve \u2014 his two Tragedies are bad \u2014 his alterations from Shak speare and Fletcher do him no great credit \u2014 but his Love for Money \u2014 Marriage-Hater Matched \u2014 Rich mond Heiress \u2014 Don Quixote and Campaigners are certainly good plays \u2014 and even the worst of his Co medies are not without a tolerable degree of merit.

Harris: he distinguished himself particularly in two characters \u2014 one of them was the Speaker of the Prologue to the play in Hamlet : this he performed with such an air as represented that he was an actor, and with such an inferior manner as only acting an actor, as made the others on the stage appear real great persons and not representatives : this was a nicety in acting as none but the most subtle player could so much as conceive \u2014 his other great part was the Apothecary in Romeo and Juliet as altered to Caius Marius as his excellence lay in so small a com pass, the Managers enlarged his sphere of action by making him Property-man \u2014 this made Peer's sub sistence very comfortable \u2014 but it frequently happens that men lose their virtue in prosperity, who were shining characters in the contrary condition : good fortune indeed had no effect on the mind, but very much on the body of Peer ; for in the 70th year of his age he grew fat, which rendered his figure unfit for his two capital parts : he had now unfortunately lost the distress necessary for the countenance of the Apothecary, and was too jolly to speak the Prologue with proper humility : it is thought this calamity went too near him : it did not a little contribute to shorten his days : as there is no state of real happiness in this life, Peer was undone by success, and lost all, by arriving at what is the end of other men's pur- suits, his ease.

Booth, on his great success in Cato, began to set more value on himself \u2014 as the License had been granted to Wilks, Dogget and Cibber in compliment to their merit as being the three best actors on the stage, it was natural that Booth, who in the estima tion of the town, now stood on a level with them, should be inclined to push his Court interest for his advantage \u2014 his interest there was very considerable \u2014 he was intimate with Lord Bolingbroke \u2014 and Lord Bolingbroke was Secretary of State \u2014 ( Theo. Cibber) at the beginning of the Winter, a new License was issued, in which Booth's name was added to that ofthe former Managers still a difficulty remained with regard to the scenes, dresses &c, which were the property of Wilks, Dogget and Cibber, and not in the power of the Crown to dispose of \u2014 the Lord Chamberlain therefore only recommended this point to be adjusted among themselves \u2014 Wilks, by way of indemnification, proposed setting a high value on their stock, but Dogget declared nothing but the Law should make him part with his property, and having said this, he left the theatre, and never returned to it as a regular actor or Manager Dogget who was"], [530, "520 d l. 1712-1713. as much obliged as the others to act on the stage and assist in the management, though he refused to do either, still demanded his whole share in the pro fits\u2014after many fruitless endeavours to bring him back, they offered him half a share, if he had a mind to quit the stage, and make it a sinecure \u2014 this he de clined\u2014after being two years in Chancery, and obtaining a decree in his favour, he gained much less than had been offered him. (C. Cibber.) It is difficult to say what could induce Dogget, who was fond of money, to throw himself out of a large annual income\u2014 if having done himself so much cre dit some years before, by defending his person against the attack of that Theatrical Despot, the Lord Chamberlain, he had a mind now to distinguish him self by defending his property, the case was quite different ; for as the License was a mere favour from the Crown and granted only during pleasure, the Crown might without injustice to Wilks, Dogget and Cibber have recalled it totally ; and a fortiori might insist on their receiving Booth into partnership, whose merit as an actor entitled him to that distinction\u2014 and as to their property in scenes dresses &c, neither Booth nor his friends objected to his paying a reason able sum for the share he was to have in them. Cibber thinks, with much probability, that Dogget repented of his conduct when it was too late \u2014 he was so immoveable in what he thought was right or wrong, that he could never be easy under any kind of theatrical government ; and was generally so warm in pursuit of his interest, that he often out-ran it \u2014 Cibber remembered him three times, for some years, unemployed in any theatre, from his not being"], [531, "d.l. 1713-1714. 521 able to bear, in common with others, the disagreeable accidents, that in such societies are unavoidable.

Christopher Rich had for some years employed himself in rebuilding this theatre \u2014 as for the order of silence, he seemed little concerned about it, while it gave him so much uninterrupted leisure to indulge his passion for architecture.

I. F. \u2014 it was opened by his son, John Rich, Avho collected some Recruits, and seduced 7 or 8 actors in one day from D. L. \u2014 this circumstance obliged the Managers of that theatre to postpone many of their best plays \u2014 Wilks, Cibber, and Booth had a great advantage on this occasion in being the principal actors themselves, yet their dividends at the end of the season did not amount to more than a third of their usual profits \u2014 hoAA'ever tbey recovered their loss the following year. ( Cibber chiefly J In some theatrical accounts the Performers, Avho go from one theatre to another, are frequently called Deserters, Avhich generally speaking is improper, for no man can be said to desert a post, in which he is not under an obligation to continue ; but on the pre sent occasion these 8 actors may be called Deserters Avith propriety, for tho' they Avere under no legal obli gation to continue at D. L., yet they left that theatre in a most unhandsome manner ; and no doubt any one of them, if he had been discharged Avithout notice, would have considered himself as 111 used. Cibber says \u2014 \" The chief of these deserters Avere \" Keen, Bullock, Pack, Leigh son of the famous \" Tony Leigh, and others of less note : it is true they \" none of them had more than a negative merit, in \" being only able to do us more harm by leaving us \" without notice, than they could do us good by re \" maining with us ; for though the best of them could"], [575, "l. i. f. 1714-1715. 565 \" not support a play, the Avorst of them by their ab \" sence could maim it, as the loss of the least pin in \" a Avatch may obstruct its motion.\" The insolence with Avhich Cibber speaks of Bullock and Pack (to say nothing of Keen and Leigh) is too bad \u2014 he is very liberal in his commendations of his predecessors, but he does not speak AveU of any of his Contemporaries cordially, except Dogget and Mrs. Oldfield. Christopher Bullock and Spiller Avere certainly tAvo of the actors Avhom Cibber does not condescend to mention by name\u2014 Cory and Knap might be the others \u2014 Husband probably returned from Ireland \u2014 it is clear that Cibber does not reckon Mrs. Rogers and Mrs, Knight among the 7 or 8 deserters, as being women \u2014 Mrs. Kent also left D.

(B.M.) From this paragraph it seems highly probable, that the Lord Chamberlain had threatened some of the deserters with the weight of his authority\u2014 Cibber's silence proves nothing [to the contrary, as in more than one instance heMoes not tell the Avhole truth.

The Non-juror Avas successful ; as the persons, who Avere offended at the political part of it, did not think it prudent to manifest their resentment at the time \u2014 but in every play that Cibber produced afterwards, they took care to be revenged on him, and paid him to the full the arrears they owed him.
