All that day groups of people gathered together on the green and on the doorsteps of their houses to discuss what had occurred ; but nobody had any new light to throw upon such a thrilling subject. An odd discovery made late in the day tended to increase the mystery rather than to clear it. Esther's red cloak was found folded neatly under a furze-bush on the now deserted Combley Heath, not far from the edge of the cliffs. Had she taken VOL. II. 15"], [12, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 2 it off to avoid being traced, or had the murderer removed it to prevent her body from being iden tified if it were found ? There was a strong tide beneath the cliffs. If a body were not washed ashore at once, the chances were that it might be carried off to sea, and who could say where it would ultimately be found ? In the meantime the feeling was very strong against the young gamekeeper who was last seen with her. He was not popular in the village, but he had been accorded unwilling respect on account of his upright, self-denying life. Now it seemed as though this had been hypocrisy ; and a smoulder ing, because unexpressed, dislike blazed out into active unjust hatred. Adam found himself awfully alone. No one stood by him. He had no means of learning whether there were any news of Esther. At night-time he went about his work in gloomy"], [13, "TOWARDS LONDON 3 silence. When morning broke he crept quietly back to the cottage. The next day, Saturday, things were much the same. He felt a strong desire hi the afternoon, when his work was all over, to walk once more over the old ground\u2014 to walk towards Combley, and to stand again where he had seen her last, with the kind blue sky above her and the cruel sea at her feet. But he dared not go. He guessed that every second person in the village had pro bably gone there to spend their half-holiday in horrible surmises. That night, however, he could not restrain his anxiety. A desire to know the worst constrained him to go to the inn. He went to the side-door, expecting that Mrs. Gay would come in answer to his knock. She had always been well disposed towards him. But the old woman, worn-out with grief and suspense, had"], [14, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 4 gone to bed. It was John Gay who came stagger ing to the threshold and stood there with a candle in his hand. Half dazed with drink, he held it so that the light fell, not upon his visitor's, but upon his own face, which was, as usual, ruddy, but no longer wore the good-humoured expression which had with many served to expiate his convivial excesses. ' Have you heard \u2014 has Esther ' stammered Adam, with dry lips. At that moment a flicker of light fell upon him. John Gay recognised him, and lost his tipsy gravity at once. With hand up lifted in denunciation, he burst into a string of furious blasphemous oaths that made Adam hurry away horrified, trembling with impotent indigna tion, but with one sentence ringing like a death knell in his ear : ' Murderer, as your father were before you ! '"], [15, "TOWARDS LONDON 5 The next day was Sunday. Since he had come to man's estate it had been Adam's custom every Sunday to hold a prayer-meeting in winter at the Gospel-shed, or in summer on the green. Not to do so this Sunday would be an admission of his guilt. So that afternoon, as usual, he took up his stand on the village green, and there waited. Nobody came. People passed to and fro, but with averted faces. When half an hour had elapsed, he began the service alone. He prayed and preached to empty air. The sound of his own voice, pierced with suffering, might have alarmed him had he thought of himself. His limbs were trembling, not with conscious cold, but with weakness. He had eaten scarcely anything since Thursday. Still, he omitted none of the usual prayers and petitions, and only one prayer was added \u2014 a prayer for"], [16, "6 VASHTI AND ESTHER Esther Gay. Tears rained down his cheeks as he pronounced her name aloud. When the service was over, it struck him suddenly that the temperature was far lower than it had been a week before. Heavy dew \u2014 or was it rain ? \u2014 lay upon his hat and clothes. A forlorn hope brightened the outlook. What if his congre gation had not deserted him on purpose ? What if they had thought it wiser \u2014 because of the change in the weather \u2014 to go to the Gospel-shed '? They might think his grief had turned his brain if they had seen him there, praying and singing all alone. They might be waiting for him now. With new strength to sustain him, he walked rapidly in the direction of the shed ; but his hopes died away one by one as he saw that there were no lights there and no marks of footsteps in the muddy lane. The gate that led to the shed was"], [17, "TOWARDS LONDON 7 tied with string, as it had been all through the summer. He turned away with a deep groan. It chanced on his way home that he passed the big room that served as a Salvationist meeting-house. That was lit up, and evidently very full. One of the windows was open, and as he stood beside it he could hear the service and see some of the people there. Some were his own people. Men and women, who Sunday after Sunday had religiously come to hear him preach the Gospel, were now joining in a hynin, the tune of which was catchy and irreverently rapid, or so it seemed to the un happy hearer. His own somewhat sanctimonious melancholy had been more grateful to these people once. Now, who was it that was standing up to give one of those stirring addresses, which, if better"], [18, "8 VASHTI AND ESTHER suited to young blood, had been condemned time after time as too presumptuous and too theatrical by those who had hitherto supported him and his creed ? Humility was a strong point of the Bible Christians. He remembered once, when a long drought had seemed to force upon them a prayer for rain, how his extemporized addition, ' But it is not what we want, not what ice want, 0 Lord,' had been taken up with undoubted, if somewhat doleful, earnestness by the whole congregation. While now these same people were in the place where, if rumour were true, one of their preachers had expressed the heretical belief that anything their sinful souls might crave would come by praying, going so far as to declare that if one were to fall on his knees and ask the Almighty for a cart, he'd get it \u2014 ' name painted on and all.' But who was going to address them now ?"], [19, "TOWARDS LONDON 9 Could it be Ben Skelton, whose defection from the Gospel - shed had been a severe blow to them that summer ? Yes, there was the whilom prize-fighter, no longer downcast over past trans gressions, but rubicund, cheery, and unbecomingly complacent, as though repentance and forgiveness were one and the same thing. As he began to speak Adam Mallard moved away. He dared not trust himself to listen. It was the old, old stum bling-block. The question as to whether, after all, those who had borne the heat and burden of the day should reap the same reward as those who came into the vineyard when the eventide was cool and the hardest labour over. His thoughts flew back to Esther, who, pure and sinless herself, had always given her sympathy to the unregenerate rather than to her enlightened lover. While he, ashamed of his origin, had always been hard upon"], [20, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 10 the gipsies, she had upheld and helped them. He had seen her once hastily pass her foot across a footmark that might have led to a poacher's detec tion. He had suspected her more than once of moving away the board that led to a cat's trap. The fact that she had supported Madge Sollace, who before her fall was her friend, had been the cause of his righteous indignation ; but, all his protests notwithstanding, she had gone to see Madge when she was ill; she had spoken to her the last time they had been together, in defiance of his wishes. Sweet and gentle as she was, in some ways she was very strong, very faithful, tender and true. A violent sob convulsed his frame ; he dare not pursue the train of thought, for Esther was gone \u2014 lost to him for ever \u2014 and by his own fault. When Adam reached his cottage he was so"], [21, "TOWARDS LONDON 11 exhausted that he never noticed his door was wide open. He sank into a chair, and let his head fall forward wearily upon his arms as they rested upon the table. How long he remained in that attitude he could not have told. When he roused himself at last, he felt refreshed as though by sleep. The night-air was blowing cold on him, and on the table before him lay a small cardboard box addressed to ' Adam Mallard, gamekeeper,' which he had overlooked before. He opened it. A few dead flowers fell out \u2014 the flowers that two days ago were sweet and fresh in Esther's hand. On a soiled piece of paper was written in a large round hand the one word only \u2014 ' Murderer.' Once more he staggered out into the air. Now he was on the road to Combley. No fear of any body being there now in the dark and the cold. He wanted to be alone on the same spot where"], [22, "12 VASHTI AND ESTHER so short a while ago he and his sweetheart were together. But as he walked slowly down the road footsteps sounded in his track \u2014 light footsteps, that had his nerves not been so acutely strung he might not have heard. As they fell they seemed to fall upon his heart ; they filled him with a horrified delight. Esther had come back ; she had come to say that the misery, the remorse, of those terrible two days were all a dream. The reality was that she lived, and would be his sweetheart still. He turned and waited till the woman reached his side. It was a woman, but it was not Esther. As she emerged from the shadow of a bush of gorse, he saw that it was Madge, the wanton, who had caused their fatal quarrel. ' Where be you going ?' he asked sternly, stand ing in her way, as though to prevent her feet"], [23, "TO WARDS LONDON 13 treading the same path that once Esther's feet had trodden. 'Going to find Esther,' she answered, looking at him in a dazed, despairing way that somehow angered him with its very hopelessness, its helpless pathos. 'Find Esther?' he repeated scornfully. 'That be what we all be a-trying to do. Where do you think she be, then \u2014 down there ?' pointing to the dark sea as it threw foam against the cliffs, and then receded only to wash back again in broken waves that made most miserable music to them both. ' Do you think she be down there ?' he asked again roughly. The girl shook her head. ' They say you murdered her. They be going to take you up to-morrow. Perhaps you threw her over here ; but, for all that, I believe she be"], [24, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 14 alive. I be going to find her\u2014 to help her as she helped me.' ' You \u2014 you help her V he cried ' Why not? Esther, the saint, safe at home, be not the Esther we must look for now. Her fate came to her as it came to me \u2014 as it comes to every woman \u2014 God pity us all ! Let us go to find her. Come.' She made a step forward. Adam retreated. Was the girl mad? Did she mean to throw him over the cliffs \u2014 to drown herself as Esther was drowned ? ' Come \u2014 come now,' she said. ' To-morrow it will be too late ; you'll be locked up by then, and I may not be able to find my way alone.' Already she had moved on \u2014 a frail figure lightly clad, and so timorous that she started at the shadows thrown by the wind-swept bushes; yet"], [25, "TOWARDS LONDON 15 quivering with eagerness to get even a little further on her way. ' Where be you going ?' he asked hoarsely. ' To London,' she replied; and she spoke in a still, hushed voice, as though she had avowed her intention of passing through the gates of hell. 'You think she be there \u2014 you think she be alive ?' ' She be alive, I feel it. We will find her \u2014 you and I who love her. We may save her even now. Will you come ?'

The moon was once more obscured ; but in the semi-darkness and the silence, broken only by the sounds of the sea and the rustling bushes, the man and the maid \u2014 the pharisaical preacher and the woman he had publicly condemned as sinner \u2014 walked on towards London together."], [27, "CHAPTEE XII.

When the door was opened to her, and she stepped into the palatial hall, with its historic tapestries and noble sculpture, she noted at once that there was no trace of that confusion which might be the sign of a recent arrival. Everything seemed comme il faitt, and in the best of working order. ' When did her ladyship arrive ?' she asked sharply. ' Her ladyship has not been away \u2014 that is, not lately,' was the reply from the most magnificent of the two powdered footmen who ushered her up stairs. 'H'm,' mused Lady Marcia, with a less well-"], [29, "POOR IN A PALACE 19 satisfied expression. A smell of newness \u2014 new wood, new varnish, new stuffs \u2014 offended her sensitive nostrils, and as she passed through the suite of drawing-rooms she saw that, though no expense had been spared to make them beautiful, they were cruelly inartistic and overdone with decorations. The walls glistened with gilt ; the most valuable marquetries, ormolus, and buhls were heaped together with no attempt at harmony or taste. There was nothing useful, nothing com fortable, nothing really pretty. ' They look like auction-rooms. I thought \"Lady Vashti\" knew better,' Lady Marcia murmured to herself. That she was right in this her last surmise was presently apparent. At the farthest end of the last drawing-room was a door which, being thrown open, revealed Violet in her boudoir, a small room hung"], [30, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 20 with a dainty old brocade, and simply furnished with some pieces of old Chippendale. Here were chairs into which it was a pleasure to sink down, cushions inviting repose, a few pieces of good china, a number of books for reading, not for show, and on a neat writing-table a jar of jonquils and nar cissus. Lady Violet, hi the simplest mornhig-gown, rose eagerly to meet her guest. ' Lady Marcia, this is kind of you- You have only just come to town ' ' I came on Saturday, \u2014 and you forget I am your aunt. Of course I came to see you directly I saw your announcement in the paper.' ' That was Kenneth's announcement.'

' And borrowed your brougham ?' \u2014 sharply. ' She has not yet got her establishment in order,' was the evasive reply, which fell futile on the ex perienced ears that heard it.

On these occasions everything was excellently done, but in the intervals between them it was popularly rumoured that the kitchen in Charles Street was an empty name and untenanted save for an unskilled female who cooked for the servants and could supply an impromptu mutton chop to her mistress if by misadventure she found herself at home for any meal. Feted and made much of by society, ' the Duchess's ' invitations were legion, and if by chance she came upon an unappropriated date she had certain rich and hospitable friends to whom she could always pro pose herself for lunch or dinner. During those two months she hired her carriages and horses, and was attended by most gorgeous footmen always six feet two niches in height, and with calves that had"], [47, "POOR IN A PALACE 37 been proved beyond suspicion. At any other time in London she never attempted to have any sort of menage: the house was determinedly shrouded in brown holland, and she was chiefly attended by a faithful maid whose devotion was as great as her perquisites were few. At such times, instead of hiring a brougham, she borrowed one from friends. This Lady Marcia well knew, but refrained from any comment on the matter. Nobody ever criticised ' the Duchess.' She was thinking most of Violet just then. As they seated themselves at the central small round table, she looked round the huge dining-room, which was calculated to dine eighty or even a hundred people, and was painfully convinced of the young wife's loneliness. For the first time she realized how she might be poor in spite, if not because, of all this splendour. After luncheon was over they drove to New"], [48, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 38 Burlington Street, where not only a ball- gown but sundry other accessories to the fact of feminine beauty were purchased.

The compliment of having a gown designed especially to suit her, and the sym pathetic kindness she had received from her new relation, had brought a brilliant colour to her cheeks and new light into her eyes. She was look ing radiantly lovely. Lady Marcia had insisted upon buying her some giant palms for ' those dreadful drawing-rooms,' and while they were choosing them in the Royal Arcade, Lord Hartrey, Mr. Lessington and Anthony Fitz-Glyn came in. Hartrey's admiration, which was only resting hi abeyance, was stimulated into"], [49, "POOR IN A PALACE 39 sudden activity at sight of Lady Violet, and Lessington for the moment forgot his own attrac tions, which were many, to favourably notice her unusual beauty. But though she chatted to them both with spirit, her attention was given to Lady Marcia, who had started a conversation with Lord Tony by remarking that 'her niece was pining away for want of flowers.' Then, in endeavouring to explain her remark, she became so incautiously explicit that it did not need the exaggerated blank ness of expression which incontinently crept over her admirer's face to tell Violet that he had under stood too much. When he joined her a moment later, she met his sympathetic silence with such un yielding coldness that Lady Marcia, uncomfortably aware that she had offended, made haste to hurry her away \u2014 not, however, before she had invited Lord Tony to a Sunday luncheon-party to meet her"], [50, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 40 niece, a Personage, the statesman of the moment, and a fashionable actress, and not before Hartrey had secured them for a dinner-party at the Savoy, at the same time exacting a promise that, if Kenneth Johnson were otherwise engaged, his wife should come with Lady Marcia. Then they drove away, finishing the afternoon with some necessary ' calling ' and a drive through the Park, where in the neighbourhood of Gros venor Gate there was already a small fashionable crowd. It was still early when Violet returned home alone, and the first thing that met her sight as she entered were the four huge palms. Beside them was a big box with Goodyear's name upon it. Evidently Lady Marcia, not content with giving her the palms, had given her some flowers as well. The whim suddenly seized her to see what she"], [51, "POOR IN A PALACE 41 could do with those dreary rooms upstairs, and, partly to please her new aunt, and partly, perhaps, to show herself superior to Mrs. Turton's machina tions, she prepared to carry it out at once. Half the household was called in to help her, and in less than an hour, with the aid of a few silk draperies and screens, and with some of her pretty wedding presents strewn upon the tables, the place assumed a more habitable, home-like air. She arranged the flowers herself, revelling in their sweet freshness and their beauty, until, just as she had buried her face in a big, cool bunch of lilies of the valley, one of the footmen handed her a card which he had found at the bottom of the box : With compliments from Lord Anthony Fitz-Glyn.' The card was allowed to flutter to the floor ; the lilies were dropped on to the table as though they"], [52, "J 'A SHTI A ND ES THER 42 burnt her fingers. With a hasty order to the servants to finish their work without her, Violet rushed upstairs, dashing into her own room like a whirlwind, and plunging her face and hands into cold water as though conscious of some contamina tion, or resenting some assault. By degrees, however, her indignation cooled. After all, the young man had meant kindly. She was too prone to anger. It was her pride and hot spirit that kept the breach between herself and her husband always open, though several times it had been bridged over by some such preparations to please him or by an affectionate appeal. These reconciliations, being only on the surface, never lasted. The prejudices of the one were still at war with the experiences of the other. Violet had no idea of dissimulation, yet her education and her bringing-up were in favour of refinement (which"], [53, "POOR IN A PALACE 43 means glossing over all the ugly facts of life), and she could more easily have forgiven worse faults than Kenneth had ever committed. He for his part was brutally honest. He never attempted to seem better than he was. The inevitable result was that his wife thought he must be worse than he seemed. She had never dared to ask him about Esther, yet the fact that he had never attempted to defend himself from an unuttered accusation was counted against him ; while she suffered most in believing that, though he loved the gipsy girl beyond all others, a sort of ' faith in unfaith ' had kept him ' falsely true ' to herself and to all the observances of love. His kisses and courtesies could mean no more than a warped sense of duty, but they must be received with wifely submiesion. The loneliest, most awful moments that Violet had as yet passed through were when she was enfolded"], [54, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 44 in her husband's arms, his lips to hers, while their thoughts and all their feelings were so wide apart. To-night, however, Violet felt hopeful of a more thorough understanding. The belief that she had also been to blame had softened some of her asperities ; and having tasted a little pleasure, she was longing for a deeper, more sustaining draught of happiness, hitherto so sadly missed. But the fates, always contrary, were once more against her. As Kenneth drove home that night he discerned a man's figure in the shadow of his house, and as he stepped down from his mail-phaeton he saw that it was Esther Gay's old lover, Adam Mallard. He uttered a hasty exclamation ; but the quondam gamekeeper did not attempt to address him.

But there was no reply. The silence was so full of contempt and condemnation that Kenneth turned his latchkey in the lock, and was glad when the great doors fell to hea\\'ily behind him. The thoughts which the unexpected meeting had aroused were not so easily dismissed. The past was once more with him, and seemed the sweeter because lately it had escaped him. His heart was so deeply stirred, his pulses were beating so strongly, that he had to call for a chasse of brandy before he went upstairs. He dressed for dinner in a dream, and could scarcely believe that he was yet awake when, as he entered the drawing-room, a woman came towards him smiling and with outstretched hands."], [56, "46 VASHTI AND ESTHER It was his wife, dressed all in white, with a diamond star set angelic fashion on her forehead : but the stately figure with gray eyes and golden hair seemed A-ague and unreal ; while his thoughts still dwelt perversely on the little gipsy, with her dark, sleek locks and gentle, loving glances, standing a slender, fragile form among the red and white holly hocks that greAv in John Gay's garden. So vivid were these mental impressions that, though he realized his wife's presence and her altered attitude towards him, though he held her in his arms and soothed her sobs as, overwrought and anxious, she began to weep, he was thinking still of Esther.

Having taken her nephew and new niece under her especial patronage and protection, Lady Marcia felt that she had a vested right to interfere in their affairs ; and belie\\Ting that she had some influence over Kenneth \u2014 less on account of her relationship than her position \u2014 she had determined to appeal to him to place matters on a more comfortable footing. What Violet had implied about Mrs. Guy Turton alarmed her ATery little. The lady was wise enough and sufficiently rusee to take care of herself and all her admirers ; but as the days went on"], [58, "48 VASHTI AND ESTHER she heard several more disturbing rumours, one of which was that he had been drawn into the toils of a certain Mrs. Venning, who was, perhaps, the most dangerous enchantress of her time.

Always glad to bring out a new star, Lady Marcia had taken Mrs. Venning under her wing to a very smart party, where, in a simple black frock with no jewels on her lovely neck and arms, and only a flower in her soft, luxuriant hair, she had piwed the sensation of the night ; in fact, she had been too successful. The guest of the evening, who encountered her for the first"], [59, "LOST IN A GREA T CITY 49 time, forgetful of the fact that he was supposed, with some reason, to be at the feet of his hand some hostess, devoted himself exclusively to her, and put a finishing touch to their mutual indis cretion by driving her home in his brougham. From that night Mrs. Venning's name was made. Her beauty was on everybody's lips, and people stood upon the chairs to see her when she walked in the Park. But her first offence and other social transgressions were laid at Lady Marcia's door, and she, unguarded in her indignant protestations, said too much. Certain of her remarks being repeated to the lady they concerned caused a natural coolness, which had never ceased. Since those days there had been great changes. Mrs. Venning, excited by her sudden elevation, lost her head. She was worse than wicked \u2014 foolish, with the result that, society's favour once withdrawn, A'OL.

In these days she was equally well known, but in a wider world, and in her character of artist and free-lance she waged successful war against those she considered instrumental in her downfall. Was it likely she would spare the nephew and probable heir of Lady Marcia if he came across her path ? So Lady Marcia was troubled, and her face was preternaturally grave when, a few days later, she found herself alone with her nephew ; and without a moment's hesitation or any preamble, she plunged into the subject on her mind. ' Kenneth, why don't you do something ?' she ejaculated. He had been glancing over a sporting newspaper"], [61, "LOST IN A GREAT CITY 51 while his wife and Lady Marcia gossiped together. Now, as he saw that Violet had left the room, he put the paper on one side ; and realizing, as he met his aunt's unflinching gaze, that her question was not a light one, applicable only to the idle moment, he prepared to answer it : 'Well, you see, Aunt Marcia, there is nothing left for me to do. The money was made before my time ; I can only spend it. I am doing so as fast as I can.' He spoke with lazy good humour : but there was a gleam in his eye that showed he resented her summary attack ; and Lady Marcia laid her little hand upon his shoulder with the intention of smoothing down his ruffled feelings.

' And support Home Rule ?' he asked sardonically, thinking what dismay this would cause in the ranks of his Irish relates and friends. ' No, no, of course not !

' I was only asking you if such a thing as patriotism was in existence. I should have thought, Aunt Marcia, that you were the last person in the world to attempt to infuse such an extinct, ante diluvian virtue into our modern organization,' said Kenneth with spirit. He had been giving a great deal of consideration to this subject lately, and therefore spoke with some heat, if with gran diloquent expression. ' Politics is a trade in which patriotism has no part.

The dainty delicacy of an old maid was ruffled by his manner rather than by the matter of his speech, and there was a suppressed A'itality (she called it violence) about him that set her nerves on edge. It was a matter of surprise to her that he had so little of the Legh in him; and she was wondering \u2014 she always would wonder \u2014 how it was that this fourteen stone of male humanity, this ' six feet one of flesh and blood and sinews, and the rest,' should have fascinated tAA'O such different characters as Lady Vashti and the little gipsy girl, Esther, when suddenly the young man's mood changed.

He leant across the table to look into her face, which was averted. When she turned round the boyishly penitent expression with which he met her gaze seemed to deprecate all her unspoken criticisms. She shook her head at him ; but her lips showed signs of relenting, and he laughed a boyish jolly laugh that at once established an entente cordiale between them. ' I'll tell you what I do belieATe,' he went on con fidentially. ' I believe patriotism does exist, but it is dormant. If the country were in danger it would soon awake.

' Think what her position is now \u2014 entering society for the first time, without the protection of her husband's presence and support. She is far too beautiful to go about alone.

The writer, in describing her appearance at the Duchess's ball, had observed that she was ' very simply dressed in picturesque white, with no orna ments but a string of pearls twisted in her golden hair ' ; and Kenneth, who was naturally very proud of her possessions, had resented the fact of her affectation \u2014 for to have the most beautiful jewels in England and not to wear them could be nothing else but affectation \u2014 being blazoned abroad. Violet was very anxious to do all that duty could dictate ; but in a large establishment, with well trained serA'ants, she found it difficult to add any thing to her husband's comfort. All she could do for him and for herself was to hide her unhappiness from the world. Since she had lost the substance"], [89, "WHICH QUEEN? 79 of good she was the more inclined to value its shadow ; therefore she was glad that he was willing to go about with her now, and AA'Ould have done almost anything to keep up an outward semblance of friendliness between them. One thing only she was too proud to stoop to : she would not dress magnificently at his expense, and she would not wear her splendid jewels. It seemed to her that it would take years of simple, even puritanical, dressing to wipe out her extrava gant display at Ladysmeade from the recollection of those who had been there. Violet was changed, but the change was only on the surface. She had learnt to enter a room alone with ease as well as grandeur \u2014 she Avas no longer awkward, or at a loss for frivolous chatter ; but in her heart she was as far away as ever from any real contact with her surroundings. The fact"], [90, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 80 that she was bored by smart people did not much matter ; the fact that she bored them was a far more serious disaster. Since her whole life might be spent among them, she was sometimes reck lessly inclined to undergo some moral deterioration rather than for ever to stand virtuously aloof. Beneath her cold demeanour there was a very human longing to love and be beloved. Nearly all the women she encountered called each other by their Christian names or by some familiar nick names. 'Darling,' 'dearest,' and other less com prehensible endearments came in every sentence of then conversation ; while she was always Lady Violet, and whenever they addressed her, all except Lettice talked the most chilling, crushing common sense. ' You are a very duckie person as you are ; but don't you think you would be happier \u2014 don't you"], [91, "WHICH QUEEN? 81 think that we should all be happier \u2014 if you were not quite so good?' Lettice Legh had asked her once with a rather shamefaced expression ; and though she had afterwards eagerly disclaimed any intention of 'being abusive,' Violet felt that even her friends condemned her as a hypocrite \u2014 a Pharisee among people of happier, less straight laced complexion. That very day ' the Duchess ' had lunched with her, and, oddly enough, had talked in the same strain. 'My dear,' she had said in the small shrill A*oice which lately, it had struck Violet, was growing very feeble \u2014 ' my dear, merely good people don't seem to get on in society. I am not talking of the Oban Campbells, who gave five hundred pounds to the National Relief Fund the other day, or the Beauclerk Browns, AA'ho subscribe to all the well-patronized charities ; and if you happen to vol. ii. 20"], [92, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 82 have a high position you can always hold your own. Witness Lady Alice Langton, whose lectures and speechifying on every subject under the sun try one beyond the bounds of patience ; and the little Duchess of Derbyshire, who amuses us (not only the masses) by her recitations ; and has schemes for the social regeneration of the classes. She wants to start a guild for the Moral Amelioration of the Smart Young Man. They say she will begin with Horace Vane and the members of the Golden Youth ; and then she means to work right through the brigade of Guards. Poor little Duchess ! she is so pretty and so sweet. I hope she won't come to grief in the process.' ' There are others \u2014 the Duchess of Baleford and Lady George Beaumont,' began Violet, more for the sake of argument than with any idea of"], [93, "WHICH QUEEN? 83 defending those with whom she seemed doomed to be allied. ' Ah, my dear ! they are saints, and we are sinners. We don't move hi the same set. The world is all the better for the existence of such women, but it only asks them to the duty-dinners. I expect' \u2014 with an accent of resignation \u2014 'we shall meet a great many social failures in heaven.' Then this afternoon had come Lord Tony's note \u2014 a climax to several pretty speeches and acts of coA-ert devotion. When he sent her those flowers after their meeting in the Royal Arcade she had meant to rebuke him ; but subsequent events had made it seem a very innocent attention. Now he sent her flowers evei-y day, and she often forgot to give him any formal thanks, while Lord Tony felt himself sufficiently rewarded if sometimes she wore them in her diess. It was his roses that scented"], [94, "84 VASHTI AND ESTHER the room and perhaps assisted in weakening her resolutions as she read and then re-read her letter. Her heart was beating very quickly ; thoughts not in the least ' good ' were thronging through her mhid. She longed so for love. Was it never to be hers because one man \u2014 her husband \u2014 had proved faithless? She caught her breath with a sharp expression of pain. Her pride was so sore on this point she dare not think about it, though it would have a natural effect on her reply. The letter must be answered, and while she hesitated confused ideas \u2014 some scarcely formulated and some instantly suppressed \u2014 were fighting for the mastery within her. If she wrote as no doubt she ought to write, she would neA-er see Lord Tony again, except at a safe distance ; and his absence meant \u2014 what . Nothing more than the advent of another loA'er. There was Lord Hartrey, whose"], [95, "WHICH QUEEN? 85 bold advances had driven her into such close com panionship with Anthony Fitz-Glyn. There were others. If the ' two and two ' system which pervaded society was an inexorable rule, was she not best paired with the man who had written this note than with any other ? He was alwaj7s so full of fun, and so popular that anyone he liked would be accepted without protest ; and if he attached himself to her as her cavalier, it would mean that she was no longer an outsider, but initiate. It would be a sort of baptism by fire. The remembrance of Lord Tony's whispered words \u2014 the words she had not rightly heard \u2014 thrilled, and yet restrained her. Innocent as she was, she knew that if they met again it must be upon a different footing. They would be more to each other \u2014 closer friends, if not quite lovers. As he had held her hand he would hold it again. His"], [96, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 86 blond head had been so near her own last night as they sat out in the garden that her hair had been stirred by his breath. His voice had sounded so close she had not dared to turn for fear their faces should touch. At the time she had forgotten to feel indignant or shocked. Her blood was stirred with dancing, adulation, and the conscious ness of his deA'otion. The whole atmosphere was intoxicating \u2014 full of danger and charm. She was so young, and the love which should have sweetened her life had been withdrawn before the cup had scarcely touched her lips. Once Sybil Hope (Sybil, whom Kenneth had more than once cited as a model of Avifely duty) had scandalized her by declaring that the essence of enjoyment \u2014 even as a married woman \u2014 lay in managing an ardent lover ; like a coquettish Canute controlling the waves of his feelings and letting them come to"], [97, "WHICH QUEEN? 87 your feet, but no farther. Lady Marcia, whose ex perience was naturally more comprehensive, though remote, had, on the contrary, remarked that the least intelligent man was more than a match for the cleA'erest woman when once he was allowed to talk to her of love. This remark, however, might haA'e been meant only as a warning. How much Lady Marcia had seen as an onlooker of the game Violet had guessed when once by mistake she called her Lady Vashti, and then explained to her what she meant by the title. Violet threw back her head in passionate revolt against what seemed to be her fate. Was Vashti always to live alone, unloved, because the King, her husband, had ceased to take any pleasure hi her beauty, and had found ' another who was better than she ' ? Crossing the room, she drew out a photo of Lord"], [98, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 88 Tony from among a crowd of others that covered a screen. She gazed intently at the good-looking, good-humoured face that, though by no means that of a hero, was still sufficiently likeable and pleas ing. The big man with his broad shoulders and loose limbs impressed her with a sense of strength ; his sleek, demurely-parted hair, his blue eyes, his dimpled chin, impressed her with a rather mistaken idea of his ingenuousness and good faith. In a sudden impulse of pity, smiling, she laid her face agahist the photograph and softly said, ' Poor fellow!' Startled by her OAvn action and on the verge of passionate tears, it was almost a relief when the door was thrown open, and, almost before she was announced, Lettice Legh was in her arms, kissing her on both her cheeks and giving her little affec tionate squeezes and hugs."], [99, "WHICH QUEEN? 89 ' My dearie ! I said you would be at home. I knew you would not be so silly as to sit in the Park in the dust and the heat just because everybody else was doing the same ; and how dear you look ! You have got a new bonnet ; how twee ! and I don't think anyone in the world was ever so lovely as you !' As she spoke, Lettice, mercurial of action as of speech, had gravitated gaily towards a big Venetian mirror, and now was balancing herself acrobatically on a milk-stool before it ; while surveying with patent satisfaction the reflection of a laughing and sun-touched face, with mirthful, mobile lips, dark eyes, and sunny chestnut hair surmounted by a shady hat. She had brought the hat to a different angle, and produced a powder-puff from the handle of her parasol to whiten a tip-tilted little nose, before she turned to answer Violet's surprised inquiry :"], [100, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 90 ' Lettice ! I thought you had gone away. Surely it was in the Morning Post to-day.' ' I know. That's the joke. Nowadays mothers propose and daughters dispose ! Didn't it read well ? I wrote it myself : \"Lady Legh and Miss Lettice Legh haATe left town for Paris, en route to Heidel berg and Homburg.\" Mother Avas delighted. I heard her confiding to all the old dowagers : \" Such a great thing to get the dear child away before the season is quite in full swing. She is so young, and yes, dear Lady Aymes, I must confess it, just a little wild. I shall bring her out properly next season.\" Properly, indeed!' (with dramatic disgust). 'I never said a word until the night before we were supposed to start ; then I told her straight out that I had not the slightest intention of going abroad. You never saw such confusion worse confounded. Mother had to go ; she could not take me by force,"], [101, "WHICH QUEEN? 91 so it was telegraphing all over the place ; ahvays the same message and generally the same reply. \" Will you take charge of Lettice? Answer paid.\" \"No, thank you.\" \"Impossible; I had her last month.\" \" Not for worlds.\" It was Sybil who said \" Not for worlds.\" I wanted to go to Millie Turton or Molly Glaive, but there mother drew the line, and perhaps they did the same. And noAV, where do you think I am until mother can make some other arrangements? Can't you guess? Why, with Susan Lady Maybury. If I had not what my governess used to call \" resources in myself,\" it would be a little depressing. She comes down at luncheon - time to ask \"What's the noos?\" and then she is dressed up in a hat and a thick veil, though she neATer moves out before four.

She goes in for being impressive. I think we shall start a piper soon, for I told her the Oban Campbells had one (Sir Oban Campbell is English, by-the-bye, but he made his money out of Dundee marmalade, so no wonder he is all for Auld Lang Syne and bannocks) ! and now Lady M. is fired with emulation.

There ought to be statues of Burke aud Lodge, and the rest of them, erected in all the fashionable squares. Don't you think so? But, darling, you've no time to think. I take your breath away, and you have not said once that you are glad to see me.' She settled herself on a footstool at Violet's feet, and looked up at her smiling, her head resting on her hands and her elbows running into Ariolet's knees. Are you glad ?' she asked wheedlingly. ' More than glad. Why did you not come to stay with me? It would have been a godsend.' Lettice thought twice before she spoke once, then ended in pre\\Tarication. When she suggested this her mother had remarked she ' could not risk it. The Johnson menage might break up any minute, and what would she do then ?' This Lettice, for-"], [104, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 94 tunately, thought better not to repeat. She merely shook her head and looked unutterably wise. ' Cela ne se fait pas.

Sybil says I'm safer than anyone she knows \u2014 except Evelyn, and he is only safe (so like a man) because he forgets everything she tells him that is not a propos of domestic economy or pheasants.

' Don't excite. It's nobody yet. But Lady May bury has made up her mind to marry me to some body \u2014 directly she has married herself.' Violet burst out laughing. ' What nonsense !

Don't you think I should make a nice wife \u2014 for a millionaire ? I am not half so bad as Sybil and the rest make out. I don't bear-fight as most girls do. It bores me to death to throw cushions and things at other people's heads. It might be more exciting if I sometimes hit them ! I don't know half so much slang and bad swears as Molly Glaive (her husband don't mind it a bit) ; and if I smoked half as many cigarettes as Millie Turton I should be ill.

She certainly looked very desirable indeed as she leant back, laughing and flushing a little from the exertion of her rapid speech. Violet said as much, and asked her rallyingly who would be the happy man. ' Mr. Lessington ?' she asked, arching her eye brows. Lettice looked doubtful ' Too lovely for everyday life, and his change of clothes would prove too distracting. I don't think I could talk male chiffons. Bobby Vere ? Oh ! A'OL.

She was accused, condemned, and sentenced by herself hi the short space of time before she pulled herself together with an effort, and answered with admirable verve : ' Child ! What on earth have you got in your small head? You have seen the photo before. Surely you have got one like it? I am writing to Lord Tony now, and \u2014 are you engaged for luncheon to-morrow?

Not only had she refrained from accusing herself by excusing herself, the commonest error in those beginning life, but in this note she had maintained a friendly formal tone which would, she surmised, be more effective self-defence than the most dignified rebuke.

Lettice had put the photo face downward on Violet's chair, a silent protest against what she seemed to have discoArered. Now she was looking out of the window in a rather disconsolate atti tude, but as her hostess moved she turned round briskly, picking out her accordion-pleated sleeA'es and shaking out her crepon skirts.

By a consensus of opinion she had been declared supremely lovelj'. There was no doubt she was angelically good. If only she had possessed more warmth of heart, more tolerance of judgment, he would never have wandered from his allegiance ; he would neA'er have loved Esther Gay.

A knock sounded at the door, and Lady Marcia's voice was heard askmg for admittance. 'It is Arery annoying, Violet,' she said, as she entered, ' but we can't go to the Savoy to-night."], [117, "AT THE AMPHITRYON 107 Not a table to be had. We are going to the Amphi tryon instead.

People are always good to reigning beauties. To-night you look what Kenneth would call \" ripping.\" Really, it is almost a pity you married money, for you look like a queen without any jewels at all.' 'Queen Vashti,' said Violet, as a rather dreary joke ; and Lady Marcia had nothing ready in the way of a pleasant reply, though just now she had diverged from the truth (for Violet's own good) with promptitude and without compunction. That very morning she had been at the Savoy Restaurant to give some final directions about a"], [118, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 108 table which, with feminine forethought, she had secured some days ago, when by merest chance she had noticed a table (for two) in what she considered too close proximity to her own. Incidentally in quiring whose it Avas, she discovered that it had been engaged by Mr. Kenneth Johnson. It was possible that Mrs. Turton, or, worse still, Mrs. Ven ning, might be his companion. If so, the situation would be very strained. At once she counter ordered her table, and drove to the Albemarle Street Club, where she fortunately found another. This being done, she still had to inform her guests of the alteration of her plans, and the unwonted excitement had left her a little flustered and upset. ' Does Kenneth know where you are dining to night ?' she asked presently, as Violet was fastening a ruby diamond butterfly in her golden hah. 'Not from me.

' You have changed, Violet \u2014 changed very much since you appeared at Ladysmeade as bride.' The girl's arms dropped to her side ; she turned round slowly.

I forgot his taste was in favour of more show.' The lid of the jewel-box was let down with a sharp click. Violet took her fan and gloves from her maid, and let her wrap an opera cloak around her. ' I am quite ready, Aunt Marcia, if you are,' she said coldly. When they reached the club, Lady Marcia waited a moment to give her orders to the coachman, and Violet entered alone.

He was a man of rather heavy figure, and of pale complexion. His expression was never a pleasant one ; it was peculiarly untaking when he wished to ingratiate himself with any woman, for he had not the slightest respect for the sex in general, and was inclined to fancy he could take the royal road into any woman's favour by bold wooing, valuable gifts, and unveiled admiration. In the case of Violet Johnson he had failed completely, but this was only (so he told himself) because no opportunity had been given him to make a good beginning. He was pleased now to notice her confusion and her rapid glance round to see if anyone were approaching to her rescue. ' \" Sister Anne, Sister Anne, is there anybody"], [122, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 112 coming?\"' he quoted mockingly. ' Lady Violet, why do you always treat me as a moral Bluebeard ?

I know I am behindhand in the jargon of the day which would describe the Venus de Milo as \" a ripper,\" and the Angel Gabriel or the Primate as \"not much in the know.\" ' The entrance of Lady Marcia created a diversion ; and Hartrey, who had lost his temper and looked very crest-fallen, followed both ladies to their table.

Quite a small and narrow apartment, with simple furniture and decorations, and no flowers on the long tables. Only the Count's table was covered with exquisite bloom and beautifully shaded lamps.

What do you think of it ? Very French, ain't it ?' ' Very,' remarked Lady Marcia dryly, but she was not referring to the arrangements of the room. Furious with her nephew for upsetting all her plans, and to no purpose, she was compelled to admit that he was behaving wonderfully well, and making the best of a bad business with the very best grace. His manner towards his wife was"], [126, "VASHTI AND ES THER 116 perfect, and Violet, realizing the awkwardness of their position, met him in the same spirit of friend liness, seeming interested in everything he said, and whispering something in his ear which caused him some confusion, though he laughed. It was the merest nothing which she had whispered, a personal remark which was neither ill-natured nor witty ; but her lips were in close contact to his ear, he thought once they touched it, and the blood rushed hotly to his forehead. It was for the benefit of the spectators \u2014 all of whom, with the exception of Lady Marcia, and perhaps Hartrey (whose face wore a look of comical commiseration which was meant to disconcert one of the actors and to open the eyes of the other), were deceived by a rather overdone byplay \u2014 that Violet presently drew a yellow rose from her bouquet and fastened it into his coat."], [127, "AT THE AMPHITRYON 117 ' I thought you were such a dandy, Kenneth. Did you forget your button-hole, or have button holes gone out of fashion \u2014 since last week ?' she asked with her most dazzling smile, and then turned away to greet some more guests. During dinner-time Violet kept up her semblance of high spirits. She scarcely glanced in the direc tion of Count de Souza's table ; but all the while she was very conscious of her husband's presence. He was not sitting next to Mrs. Turton \u2014 that seat had probably been filled up while he delayed \u2014 but next to ' the Duchess,' who was looking the great lady that she was in a well-worn black satin gar ment (it was frequently remarked among her inti mates that her faithful maid must have very few perquisites), with a coronet of diamonds on her head and a glittering necklet of brilliants coArering her neck, which was also shrouded in fine laces."], [128, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 118 In spite of her short stature, the Duchess of Skye carried herself like the ideal duchess. She was almost the last living specimen of the women who flourished more than half a century ago, women of splendid physique, free from modern illnesses and nerves, and who look at us out of old miniatures and pictures aghast at the vulgarities of our much vaunted civilization, with its publicity, its rush, its stress of mind and body. ' The Duchess ' was never ill ; she never admitted bemg tired ; but when Violet met her glance, the smile with which she nodded ' how d'ye do ' seemed shadowy and faint. Violet would have liked to have spoken to her as she went out ; but Lady Marcia was in a hurry. Someone had lent her a box at the Opera, and she wanted to hear somethmg of the music before going on to Mrs. Peachem."], [129, "A T THE AMPHITR YON 119 As they drove away together, Lady Marcia patted her niece encouragingly on the knees. ' You did splendidly. So did Kenneth. I was proud of you both. After all, my dear, the \" angel unawares \" is a nuisance in society. I think you have altered for the better, not for the worse.' Violet smiled rather dolefully at what was meant to be a jest. She scarcely spoke on her way to Covent Garden, and her thoughts were very far away, yet A-aguely tender, as she listened to Calve's rich impassioned voice. Every now and then she looked towards Count de Souza's box, wondering if his party would come in on their way to the ball ; but it remained empty.

Violet said no more. When the carriage stopped at her door she got out and ran upstairs, returning after some minutes' absence, and submitting blush ingly to Lady Marcia's quick, scrutinizing glance. ' I thought it would please Kenneth,' she said in a shamed whisper. ' Quite right, my dear, quite right, and your tiara is ATery well put on and suits you very well.

Although Violet had already been out a great deal this season, and to some of the best houses, she was unprepared for the magnificence of the sight that greeted her as she alighted and passed mto Mrs. Peachem's house. It beggared description. The whole outlook was a garden \u2014 a garden all flowers, with only a thin veil of green ; while the hall was a miracle of coolness, with splendid palms and enormous blocks of ice half hidden among foliage and ferns on the pure white marble floor, and dropping from the ceiling and"], [134, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 124 trailing over the balustrade of the white marble staircase were the costliest orchids, purple and golden \u2014 royal colours. Bej'ond the hall was an expanse of tenting erected in the garden, and trans formed into a bower of A-ari-coloured roses, and a very maze of trellised paths leading to the love liest nooks for sitting out. The number of roses used for this alone numbered many thousands. Some said the flowers en masse had cost \u00a32,000 ; others declared that \u00a34,000 \\A-as nearer the true figure. Violet passed upstairs as though passing through an illustrated fairy-tale, with herself as the en chanted princess. Where was Prince Charming? she wondered and sighed. Many strange faces met her on her way upstairs, and she spoke to several people whom she knew. Everyone in London seemed to be present, yet there was no"], [135, "A ROYAL FEAST 125 overcrowding and no heat. All the windows had been taken out, and the cool night air was blowing through strained muslin deluged with the freshest scent. At the head of the staircase stood the hostess, tall and gaunt, but of a rather stately presence, with a purposely modest tiara, and some priceless lace, but very few jewels \u2014 sapphires \u2014 on her royal blue velvet gown. She greeted Violet with empresse ment. Delighted at the success of her endeavours, she beamed at everybody who came up, and every noAV and then in her excitement she forgot her still new rule of grande dame, and was once more the jocular provincial dame of earlier days. When ever her daughter came in sight she pulled herself together with an effort. It was necessary she should remember she was already the mother-in law of a duke's daughter, and might become, in"], [136, "126 VASHTI AND ESTHER spite of her husband's loud disclaimings, the mother-in-law of a prince. As Violet and Lady Marcia entered, Lettice ran towards them looking radiantly pretty and de lighted. 'Isn't it too lovely!' she cried rapturously. ' Lord Tony says it's \" bang-up \" \u2014 his highest praise. The dinner was perfection, and served in an hour and a half. No confusion. Each man as he arrived was presented with a printed card telling him who he was to take in and at which table he would find places. There were six tables, with different flowers on each. Lady Maybury sat at the table, which was a mass of orchids. At our table we Avere all boys and girls, and the flowers were white lilies.' 'Who else sat at the table?' asked Lady Marcia curiously."], [137, "A ROYAL FEAST 127 ' Royalty, of course ; he took in Mrs. Peachem.

That table was a sight to see !' ' And who took you in ?' asked Violet 'Lord Tony,' answered Lettice, blushing. He came up as his name was mentioned, and after asking Violet for a dance later on, went off again with Lettice."], [138, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 128 Violet's matchmaking scheme had succeeded be yond her expectations, perhaps beyond her hopes. The young man had been furious when first made aware of her tactics ; but after a while \u2014 for Violet arranged more meethigs \u2014 he began to appreciate the girl's sweet temper and bright spirits, while a devotion that was first assumed in pique ended in real earnest. He soon found that Lettice's light hearted ' So dear of you !' was more of an incentive to further deeds of gallantry than Violet's rather stilted ' Thank you.' Lord Tony was accustomed to be made much of by women \u2014 and liked it. Violet had a very great success that night. Royalty asked her to dance, and she sat near him at supper glittering in primrose satin and silver, with diamonds and rubies, and (her little social triumph having dispelled her natural shyness) radiant with pleased excitement. Kenneth felt"], [139, "A ROYAL FEASI 129 passionately proud of her as he watched her from a distance, and later in the eA'ening he found a chance of getting near her. She had been dancing with Royalty again ; an empty circle was left round her, and Kenneth pushed past several others who were intending to approach her. Her flower was in his coat, her whisper was still sounding in his ear. ' Just one turn with me, Violet,' he said, with a pleading accent in the peremptory tones that were meant to dispose of her objections, and caused her to place her hand upon his arm shyly, blushingly, almost as though he were a suitor, and not her legal lord and master. They had neATer waltzed together before. Their courtship was a rural one, without the adventitious aid of balls and parties ; and it had not lasted through their fashionable married life. Now Ken- vol. 11. 23"], [140, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 130 neth threw his arm round his wife's waist Avith masterful tenderness, and Violet, who danced lightly in spite of her height, scarcely touched the ground as he drew her in and out of the dancers. She felt as though floating in mid-air. It was all part of the fairy-tale ; only now the man who was once, and should be now, her Prince Charming was with her. It was rather a sudden return to earth when the music ceased and she slipped her fingers from her husband's grasp as his arm fell from her waist. She was blushing still and trem bling, and just a little out of breath, when someone spoke to her, and, looking up, she found her bete noire at her side. ' Lady Violet, if you introduce these Utopian habits into society, you will be responsible for the results. I can't imagine what London would be like if the domestic virtues began to flourish at the"], [141, "A ROYAL FEAST 131 expense of all our pleasant vices. May I have this next dance ? It is another waltz. No, it's the pas de quatre, and I don't think the pas de quatre is worthy of your dignity \u2014 or of my discretion. We will sit and watch it, if you like.' Violet looked round anxiously for Kenneth. He had gone. ' The Duchess ' came up, but she was hurrying on to speak to somebody ahead, and only paused to lay her hand affectionately on Violet's shoulder. ' My dear, I said you would swim \u2014 I said you would be the fashion. Horace Vane is raving about you, and Royalty, the best of judges, de clares you are the loveliest woman in the room,' she whispered as she passed. There was nothing for Violet to do but to resign herself to Hartrey's companionship. She took the chair he offered, but edged it as far away as"], [142, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 132 possible from the one in which he was sitting, and she only A'ouchsafed monosyllabic replies to his remarks. Just in front of them Lettice and Lord Tony were dancing together \u2014 Lettice, slim and graceful, sway ing like a reed to the lilt of the music, her little hand in Lord Tony's, and looking up into his face with mirthful, happy eyes. Her lissomeness was the more noticeable that near her Veronica Peachem, stoutly-built and plain, was romping through the dance with undiluted energy and strength, while, farther away, Lady Glaive had cast her demureness to the winds, and was moving wildly to the measure, the prettiest young Bac chante in white, with green ribbons and green leaves in her rough brown hair. For a wonder, her husband was dancing with her. He was as young and as good-looking as herself, but they frequented"], [143, "A ROYAL FEAST 133 different sets, and seldom crossed each other's paths. ' I told you,' obseived Lord Hartrey to his com panion, with a sneer, ' that you were introducing a very dangerous fashion.' When the music ceased the ball-room did not empty. It was getting late, and the dances fol lowed each other in rather quick succession. People were walking up and down : some stood in groups to talk ; but presently, as though by magic, they all gravitated to one end of the room. Violet stood up to follow. ' Is it late ? Is everybody gomg ?' she inquired. ' No, it is only Royalty taking its departure, and eAreryone is crowding round on the chance of a nod or a word. Snobbishness must be more than skin deep in British nature if it affects the flower of our aristocracy as well as our middle classes. You"], [144, "\u25a0 34 VASHTI AND ESTHER and I are left stranded here alone. No, there's \" the Duchess.\" Good God ! what has happened ?' Violet flew past him, and was half across the floor before he caught her up. There against the wall sat ' the Duchess,' all alone and rigidly erect, with flowers in her dress and diamonds glittering on her head and neck. Her figure was reflected again and again in the flower-wreathed mirrors round her ; but there was no moA-ement of her limbs, and her beautiful old face was white \u2014 as death. ' What is it ?' cried Violet, throwing herself down upon her knees beside her. ' Oh, Lord Hartrey, is she dead ?' The death of the Duchess of Skye would in any case have caused a most profound sensation ; but occurring as it did at the ball of the season, in the"], [145, "A ROYAL FEAST 135 presence of all the fine fleur and Royalty itself, it attained to the importance of a national tragedy. The newspapers were full of the event, and devoted a great deal of their space to praises of the grand old lady who had had so many friends and yet no enemies, who Avas so constant and un ostentatious in her charities, who, herself of highest degree, had never despised those less fortunately placed, or envied those who were endowed with wealth. She had never been known to do an ill-natured thing, or to say one ; she never circulated any scandal. While one half of the world was condemning the other half for its frivolities and sins, she lived in peace and goodwill with all around her. Everyone went to her for advice \u2014 she was a universal peacemaker. She enjoyed everything intensely to the last, and was unfailing in her brilliant wit and charming humour."], [146, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 136 For the last fifty years she had been one of the most important pieces on the social chess-board, moAdng among kings and queens as though by right, and enjoying royal privileges, while the unimportant pawns and all onlookers at the game folloAved her moves with blindest admiration. No other woman had approached her in popularity but Lady Marcia, and she Avas genuinely grieved at the calamity which left her first favourite in public estimation. Although Violet had only knoAvn her for so short a time, she, too, was intensely distressed. ' The Duchess ' was one of her first and kindest friends. Losing her was like losing a landmark in her life ; and the fact that she had died so before her eyes, and amidst such incongruous surround ings, had added to her natural sorrow.

Kenneth had carried his wife half fainting from the ball-room, and had brought her home. The next morning, as she was sitting in her bedroom ready dressed, but reluctant to go down to take up life again as though nothing had occurred, he came to her door and knocked gently. 'I thought you would like to hear about \"the Duchess.\" I have just come back from Charles Street,' he explained apologetically as he came in. Violet raised her tired eyes to his face ; she had not slept, and they were red with weeping. Her golden hair was pushed back carelessly from her face, which looked very white and wan against her plain black frock. ' You are very kind ; you were very kind last night,' she said gratefully."], [148, "138 VASHTI AND ESTHER ' I thought you would like to know she could haA-e suffered nothing. The doctor was at Charles Street. He says it was simply failure of the heart's action from over-exertion and old age. Death must have been instantaneous !'

Did I tell you that during dinner at the Amphitryon she turned very white and nearly fainted ? We thought she would not have gone to the ball ; but she seemed better after some brandy and champagne, and she was determined to go on.' ' Poor Duchess,' said A^iolet sadly. 'She had a horror of falling out of the ranks.

She turned away her face, and, to hide her distress, began to trifle with the silver ornaments on the dressing-table at her side. Kenneth stood awkwardly near. He would have given much to have taken her in his arms and comforted her, only the fear that he might add to, instead of lessening, her distress restrained him. As matters stood now, they were less than"], [150, "VASHTI AND ESTHER 140 loA'ers, and yet more than friends. It was altogether such an impossible position. ' I wish I could help you. I wish I knew what to say or do,' he said gently. His voice, usually loud and self-assertive, was so softened and so full of pity that Violet's heart was touched. She looked up impulsively ; but the words that trembled on her lips were not spoken. At that same moment her fingers, wandering idly among the trinkets on the table, came in contact with a box of chocolates which she had bought for Lettice's delectation once Avhile driving together, and the tenor of her thoughts was incontinently altered.

That season was a very brilliant one. The great hostesses vied with one another, and several new hospitable lights appeared, some of whom were destined by sheer force of generosity and nous to keep the footing they had gained. The Johnsons also had a house-warming. Lady Marcia, with her customary frank sincerity, had told them that they could do no less.

She wrote the note at once, and then gave it into his hands. ' \"Will you take it ?' she asked, and the trust implied in the inquiry did more to bind her husband to her than the religious and legal ceremony which had proved so merely nominal a tie.

So long as Violet was contented, what did it matter ?"], [170, "160 VASHTI AND ESTHER It was just as well she should not seem to be jealous.

The Legh blood was coming out in Kenneth since his marriage, but there was a good deal of the Johnson in him still ; while Violet was aristocrat to the tip of her small fingers, and critical almost to a fault. Once in a burst of confidence Violet had broached the subject of Kenneth's excruciating taste in neckties ; but this trouble Lady Marcia made light of. She herself attached no importance to the"], [171, "THE GOLDEN SCEPTRE 161 different details of men's dress, and even welcomed any deviation from the lines prescribed by Beale and Inman and the rest as a sign of saA'ing individuality and therefore grace ; yet on second thoughts she could easily imagine that A:iolet might have different A-iews upon this point, and a few days later she appeared in the Carlton House Terrace Library, Kenneth's favourite retreat, with the footman carrying a parcel behind her. ' AYhen's your birthday, Kenneth ? This month ? I quite forget the date. Not till December? I believe my memory is going. AATell, you'd better take my offering now, while I think of it.

She had taken Mr. Lessington as her model of good taste, but unfortunately, while he was un consciously under her notice, he had been in slight mourning ; therefore the grays and the magpie black-and-whites were, as she surmised, a little monotonous of tone. Kenneth, however, was determinedly on his best behaviour, and wore them steadily, one after another, without even a rebel lious swear. He read Lady Marcia's lesson broadly, and in other things set himself more seriously to please his wife.

All balls were much alike in themselves, but delicious thrills of anticipated pleasure, and unexpected intoxicating details of actual enjoyment, had lent variety and charm to parties that Lettice Legh pronounced ' as dull as ditchwater,' and which Lady Marcia condemned ' as not at all smart.' At last she was entering into the spirit of the fun around her.

All things had tended towards his education, but as usual it was women who had formed it. Mrs. Turton and Mrs. Venning had been stimulating, if not elevating, influences upon his character ; and little Esther, with her tender truth and shy worship of himself, had opened his eyes to the delicate beauty of a woman's nature.

Her strident tones carried farther than she knew, and Susan Maybury tossed her head in indignant disdain with an audible comment.

Ariolet came away still undecided, and feeling"], [183, "JEWELS WITHOUT PRICE 173 miserably poor by contrast with the Peachem possessions. Now her brows were bent in an anxious frown ; she ran her slim fingers through her hair, and clasped her head convulsively while she made another calculation. It came out a little more than before.

It would only be a joke. Kenneth would glory in her extravagances, and hicite her to other and to worse misdeeds.

But Kenneth was painfully aware that he had still to be proved trustworthy, and he Avent on hurriedly : ' There is so much that you will have to forgive me, dearest. I am ashamed to speak to you of some of my follies ; but there is one thing I must tell you \u2014 the story ' 'I know,' she interrupted, nestling a little closer to his shoulder, and venturing for the first time to look into his face.

' Violet, you don't believe now that I had any thing to do with that poor girl's disappearance?' he asked her abruptly. At first he had been at a loss to understand her meaning ; but by degrees he became aware of a certain similarity between the Bible story and the story of their very modern life. Then he wondered"], [190, "180 VASHTI AND ESTHER how much she was ready to forgive ; whether she believed him altogether false, or whether she was waiting for some proof that he was guiltless. ' I shall only believe what you tell me,' whispered Violet. At that moment, in the very nick of time, Lady Marcia Legh burst in upon them, subdued to the verge of solemnity, but full of the importance of what she had to say. She hurried up to Kenneth (nearly tumbling over Violet, who was still crouched upon the floor) and seized him by the hand. ' I want to beg your pardon, Kenneth, for the injustice I have done you.

Desperately uncomfortable at the idea that she had intruded on a scene of reconciliation, and pain fully distorting her face in useless efforts to seem unaware of the lover-like position in which she had discovered a couple who were supposed to be the latest object-lessons in marriage \u00ab la mode, Lady Marcia made her way to the door, and, once safely on the other side, closed it with a firm and unmis takable click. Kenneth was standing up, but he still clasped"], [192, "182 VASHTI AND ESTHER his wife's hands, and he threw back his shoulders as though relieved of a burden. ' Now,' he said, and, stooping, kissed his wife's sweet lips \u2014 ' now, Violet, I can tell you the whole story.' Though the best detective intellect available had been set at work by Lady Marcia, it was OAving to accident, and not to the efficiency of the police, that Esther was at last discovered. Walking by way of Leicester Square and Covent Garden to the City, Adam Mallard had chanced to come upon a little crowd which might not have attracted his attention had not the street been so narrow that he was almost forced into its midst. Two policemen were carrying a woman on a stretcher, and the hem of her petticoat, fluttering against his sleeve, made Adam turn to look at her more closely. There had"], [193, "JEWELS WITHOUT PRICE 183 been a handkerchief laid over her face ; but it had been blown to one side, and it was nobody's busi ness to replace it. A hoarse, agonized cry thrilled the careless passers-by as Adam realized that at last his search was ended. Esther was not dead. She had fainted outside the Garden Theatre (so one of the policemen said, in answer to inquiries), and a chorus-girl who happened to be standing near the door had known her address. Adam followed the procession into a neighbouring alley ; and as he saAv her carried into a broken-down tenement, where a shrill-voiced woman was screaming through an upper window to some half-clad children who rolled contentedly in the dust at the door, he understood at once what squalid poverty, what privations, she must have endured.

She had found her wandering in the street one night, having just come from the country, and being in search of lodgings which would suit her slender purse. Finding it impossible to mistrust the pretty guile less face, she had brought her back with her at once ; and here she had been ever since, though backward with the rent sometimes, and often going without food. Work was hard enough to get here, as everywhere else ; but a lady at the Garden Theatre had taken a fancy to her, and"], [195, "JEWELS WITHOUT PRICE 185 through her she had got a big order.

Sure it's working the life out of her she's been doing, and small thanks for it all and small pay, and she starving all the while, and niver a word of complaint,' finished the woman, wiping away the ready tears with the back of a grimed hand. Adam, feeling that his friendship was of little pecuniary A'alue, could only empty his pockets of a few loose coppers as an earnest of good faith ; and imploring the woman to do all she could for Esther he hurried off to Lady Marcia. It chanced that that lady was out, and he did not succeed in finding her at home until the next morning. Then she at"], [196, "186 VASHTI AND ESTHER once despatched a doctor to see Esther ; and a little later followed with Adam in a hansom, laden Avith all the good things that she could get together.

AVhen she came out of the house a flickering sarcastic smile played about her mouth. Long ago she had had romantic dreams herself, but they had been only dreams, and were resolutely thrust back into the recesses of her mind to make room for more intellectual pleasures. Noav she could safely laugh at love and those who felt its scars ; but she felt more inclined to cry to think that Violet, her lovely, haughty 'Lady Vashti,' should have become so entangled in its meshes as to be at her plebeian nephew's feet. The smile and the sneer had both faded from her"], [197, "JEWELS WITHOUT PRICE 187 face when she entered the little dingy room where Esther lay dying.

She must have been dying for days, dying on her feet, as these poor souls so often do.' All that was ' pure womanly ' in Lady Marcia's character came to the surface as she sat by Esther's bed. The worldliness on Avhich she prided herself was only a thin crust under which the truest, tenderest heart was beating. She would almost have given her right hand to save the child beside her. It was too late to apply any remedies or to attempt to add to her comfort.

She preferred to leave it untouched, as he had given it ; and to die.

The light soon faded ; the eyes"], [201, "JEWELS WITHOUT PRICE 191 were growing glazed in death. Lady Marcia saw the end was near. 'Pray, Adam, pray!' commanded Lady Marcia : but no sound broke the heavy stillness.

His hungry eyes lost no detail of the sweet loA-eliness that he was losing. As he had suffered for her, and lost his comfortable living for her sake, so he loved her all the more. From the crown of her small head to her little bare feet he loved her with such hopeless passion that he could frame no words of prayerful resignation.

At the same moment, not many miles away, Kenneth, haA-ing told his story and won forgiveness for his unfaith, had forgotten Esther's existence. He had honestly meant to tell the truth, the Avhole truth, and nothing but the truth. If uninten tionally he conveyed a wrong impression, it was because, with Violet all his own at last, it was difficult to believe that he had ever really loved another ; and she was very ready to believe that his feeling for the pretty gipsy girl was only a light fancy, Avhile naturally inclined to credit her with being more to blame.
