T OED BYBON was tlie product of a remarkable period which greatly affected his character, even when he least appeared to resemble it. The events of his life are too well known to require relation ; but a few dates it will be desirable for us to recollect. Born of a good country family, in 1788, he was eight years old when Burns \u2014 after showing the way to the reform of poetry- \u2014 sank into his premature and deplorable grave. By the mother's side Byron was a North Briton descended from the Gordons of Gight, an old Scottish family. His mother was a widow, in straitened circumstances, when the boy passed his early years in Scotland, like his elder contemporary, Walter Scott. These things mark the affinities of Byron's nascent genius ; they help us, likewise, if we seek to know why he was, from first to last, so completely outside the literary movement of the day, and so out of sympathy with Coleridge and Words- worth, even with Keats and Shelley. Our fundamental notion of Byron ought not to be that of an English noble, brought up at Harrow and at Cambridge. Such a training might have produced a statesman, a traveller, or even a social satirist, it could hardly by itself have given us Childe Harold. If the destinies of men are shaped by the con ditions in which they pass through their tenderest state,"], [10, "INTRODUCTORY. VI then the congeners of Byron are rather Burns and Scott. Endowed, like the former, with the gifts that win the love of woman, like the latter he had pride of race, with a physical infirmity which \u2014 resembling the car companion of the triumphing Eoman general \u2014 was. ever at hand to whisper lessons of modesty or of discontent. In 1798, when only teu years of age, Byron became an English peer ; and then his whole circumstances underwent a fatal change. In 1801 he left for ever the banks of Dee, the braes of Lochnagar, to pass the next few years of his life in England, as the ward of Lord Carlisle. Like his future friend Shelley, he had an individuality too strong to be much influenced either by the teaching of a public school or by that of a University. At the end of his Cambridge course he wrote to a friend that his reading had been \" tolerably extensive in the historical department from Herodotus down to Gibbon.\" But he added that he had learned but little of Law, Geography, or Mathematics. [To Mr Dallas, Jan. 21, 1808.] Leaving college thus equipped, he emerged into the arena of letters with a mediocre collection of juvenile verses for which there was no welcome in those stirring times. They were the days of Eylau and of Friedland, of the Treaty of Tilsit and the French conquests in Spain. The Hours of Idleness had, indeed, the honour of a notice in the Edin burgh Review ; but the notice was contemptuous. The young author gave the first taste of his quality by his fierce retort, called English Bards and Scotch Reviewers ; and in June 1809 he set forth to visit those parts of the Continent which still remained accessible to the enemies of Napoleon. This was the period to which Byron afterwards referred in apostrophising the mighty Corsican after his fall : \u2014 \" There was a day, there was an hour, When Earth was Gaul's, Gaul thine.\""], [11, "INTRO D UCTOR Y. VII In that volcanic moment of crisis Byron's career was determined. His early circumstances had not fitted him especially for the career of a man of letters ; and after events were to show how much his nature included of ability as a man of business \u2014 perhaps, even as a statesman and soldier. His mind received its final bent from his visit to the battle fields of Spain. Nor was Byron at all aware, at first, of any portion of his own powers. On his return from the Mediterranean in 1811 he brought back the 1st and 2nd Cantos of the work before us, but had no suspicion that they contained the germ of a great reputation. Published, literally, at the suggestion of friends, February 1812, they got into their seventh edition in less than seven weeks, a rare example of contem- porary success endorsed by posterity. From that time to the wreck of his home he lived the life of an Englishman of rank, who was also a famous writer ; but those four years contain the whole of his career as a member of London society. In 1815 he married, and at the end of twelve months his wife left his house for ever. Byron now returned to the Continent, where he rapidly wrote the 3rd Canto of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, sending it home for publication in June 1816. In his covering letter to the publisher, he said that this Canto was \"longer than either of the two former, and in some parts, it may be, better.\" This conjecture proved more correct than the usual appreciation by authors of their own works ; and when, a year later, the 4th Canto came to be written, the work was rounded off by a vigorous completion. Byron's last considerable poetical work was the satirical and romantic medley caUed Don Juan ; and he dropped it, unfinished, in 1821, when he earnestly adopted the active support of the Greeks, then struggling for the emancipation from Muhamadan rule, which they have long since obtained. In 1823 he left Italy to take a personal part in the war, and"], [12, "INTRODUCTORY. VIII died, in Greece, in the spring of the following year, aged thirty-six. Such a singular life had singular results. Byron stands before us, in some respects, greater in what he was than in what he did. His literary work is, to the last, that of the man of the world playing at authorship. His personal character for a long while hardly appears much more sincere. In both he seems self-conscious, affected, and wanting in earnest effort. Both as a writer and generally, as a young man, he seems to lack the high sense of discipline. This it is that makes Childe Harold's Pilgrimage such an unequal com position even more than the difference of conditions in which its various parts were produced. Scarcely a stanza is perfect, or free from carelessness in workmanship. On the other hand, there are many passages which give notice of true greatness. Such are the stanzas on Waterloo ; the description of the Lake of Geneva in calm and tempest ; much of the meditations among the ruins and monuments of Eome ; and the celebrated Address to the Ocean with which the poem closes. In all these we see a keen observation, a resolute reflection, and the power of expression combined with an almost unwearied flow of lofty diction. It is true, however, that the observation is rather broad than deep ; the reflection general, and at times somewhat superficial ; the expression sometimes ill-sustained and liable to drop into weak versification and bad grammar. But all such faults are either swallowed up in a sense of the author's great ability, or excused by a knowledge of causes in his life which con tinually weakened the calls of obligation. Nor would it, for other reasons, be reasonable to expect a consistent plan in such a composition as Childe Harold. The earlier portion\u2014 Cantos L, IL\u2014 appeared with the some what affected sub-title, \"AEomaunt,\" by which may have been implied a desire that the work should be taken for a fiction. It seems, really, to have been at first a kind of"], [13, "INTRODUCTORY. IX journal of travel, written (under the excitement of new and romantic scenes) in the form of verse. During his tour in the Mediterranean, Byron occasionally wrote letters to his mother, and in one of these letters \u2014 dated \"Athens, January 14, 1811\" \u2014 he says that he has \"done with authorship,\" and shows a disposition to rest his future reputation on the satire already mentioned (English Bards and Scotch Reviewers). But he adds that he has some other writings by him, which \u2014 \u2022\" if deemed worth publishing \" \u2014 may serve to prolong his memory when he is dead. After his return he must have put some finishing touches to Canto I., seeing that it was not tiU about August 1, 1811, that he heard of the death of his kinsman, Captain Wingfield, which is lamented at the close (vide st. 91, 2). In a letter written soon after, however, he refers to \" the Pilgrimage \" as ready for publication; and his \"Preface\" is dated \"February 1812.\" In this short introduction the author thus charac terises his work : \u2014 \u25a0 \" The following poem was written, for the most part, amidst the scenes which it attempts to describe. It was begun in Albania (vide c. ii. st. 42-52) ; and the parts relative to Spain and Portugal were composed from the author's observations in those countries (c. i. st. 15-90) There,1 for the present, the poem stops ; its reception wiU determine whether the author may venture to conduct his reader to the capital of the East, through Ionia and Phrygia : these two cantos are merely experimental.\" So far, we hardly see any definite ambition beyond the production of a sort of metrical guide-book. But the author's London life, unfortunate marriage, and estrangement from his native land, combined to produce a change in his mental habits and aspirations. After a stay of some months amid the mountains of Switzerland, he wrote to his publisher, Mr Murray, under date June 27, 1816, that he had \"finished 1 Greece."], [14, "INTRODUCTOR Y. X a 3rd canto of Childe Harold ; \" and he added the descrip tion already recorded, showing a higher appreciation of his present work as compared with the value he had originally placed upon the earlier portion. Still more than the 1st and 2nd cantos, the 3rd will be seen to abound in direct pictures of Nature's sublimer scenes, shown in the light reflected from a mature but sincerely melancholy mind. It may be doubted whether, in their own peculiar manner, the descriptions of Night and Tempest on the Lake of Geneva have ever been surpassed in English poetry. The stanzas to his child, and the thoughts on his own lonely situation, have a genuine ring also, and take the canto quite out of the region of traveUers' handbooks. Canto III. appeared without any prefatory prose ; but the letters to Murray show that it went to press in 1817. At this time the author was inclined to revert to his doubts as to a permanent pursuit of literature. \" It is nothing,\" so he wrote to his brother-poet, T. Moore, in February of that year : adding, \" I do not think that it is my vocation.\" If he lived ten years longer, he meant to distinguish himself in some more important field. In January 1818 he sent home the MS. of Canto IV., calling it his \"ultimate canto.\" Here, also, there was no hint of \" Ionia, Phrygia, and the capital of the East;\" but \u2014 as announced in a dedication to Mr J. C. Hobhouse, the companion of his youthful travels in Greece\u2014 a somewhat new departure from the lines of any of the former cantos was made. \" There will be found,\" says Byron, \" less of the Pilgrim than in any of the preceding ; and that little slightly, if at all, separated from the author speaking in his own person.\" The limits proposed are said by him to be \" hardly sufficient for the labyrinth of external objects and the consequent reflections ; \" but few readers will regret that this was so. Byron had originaUy intended that Canto IV. should include disquisitions on the literary and social aspects"], [15, "INTRODUCTOR Y. XI of contemporary Italy ; but we have gained more in the musical and eloquent pictures of landscape and seascape, classic monuments and medieval architecture, than anything that we may have lost in the direction indicated as abandoned. Canto IV. excited the mind of the author : \" Is Childe Harold nothing? \" he asks his publisher in 1819 \" You have many divine poems \u2014 is it nothing to have written a human one ? \" In this outburst we find confirmation of our own impression of Byron's mental growth. The man was already great who could produce the nocturne, or night-piece (st. 27-29), the pictures of Clitumnus and Terni (st. 66-72), the stanzas on Eome (78-82, 128-147), and the famous Address to Ocean (178-184). It was not till the thirty-fifth year of his life, after experiencing the vanity of rank, the fickleness of fame, and the insufficiency of sensuous enjoyment, that Byron saw the veil fall from the face of Duty. The effect was immediate and final : the call to Greece roused him for good and all. Thereupon we see his affectations vanish, his poetry turn to practical prose, and the man of affairs and of sincerity emerge in a marvel of metamorphosis. A sturdy Briton at heart, he now evidently looked forward to a reconciliation with his country, and desired that his countrymen should do what they could for Greece with full knowledge of the case. They had proved, he said, both able and willing, and \" upright as usual \" (letter to Bowring, Nov. 29, 1823). In an address to the Greek chiefs, of the same date, he adds these noble words : \u2014 \" I desire the well-being of Greece I will do all I can to secure it. But I cannot consent that the English public, or English individuals, should be deceived as to the real state of Greek affairs.\" Such an honest patriotism underlay Byron's pretended"], [16, "XII INTRODUCTORY. estrangement : yet that estrangement is a matter that must be remarked. For it had this undoubted effect, that it made him less insular than any of his most illustrious centemporary fellow-countrymen, and gave him a sympathy with con tinental thought which has been rewarded by continental popularity. It has been said by a distinguished modern Italian that \" Byron made English literature European.\" ANALYSIS OF THE POEM. Cantos L, II. It was on the 31st October 1809 that Byron, not yet twenty one years of age, began Childe Harold. He was then travelling in the north-western part of the Greeco-Turkish peninsula; and, after a visit to the Viceroy, Ali Pasha, was making a short stay at Joannina, or Yanina, about 50 miles inland from the coast opposite Corfu. He wrote with such facility that the 2nd canto was completed on March 28 of the following year. It is doubtful whether so large a quantity of good and distinguished work was ever produced in so short a time, or by so young a writer. The 1st canto describes the departure from home of a young Englishman, declared by the author to be an imaginary character, but in whose description Byron's mental habits led him to introduce, however unintentionally, parts of his own nature ; indeed, in the original draft there is an indication that the self delineation was not quite unconscious, for the hero was named \" Childe Buron.\" The first intention of the author had been to go to India, and to this he makes allusion in stanza 11. After a melodious farewell to his native land, the traveller reaches Lisbon, the capital of Portugal ; and, so far at least, the poetic journey exactly corresponds to that which really happened : Lord Byron left Falmouth, July 2, 1809, and landed at Lisbon five days later. The place"], [17, "INTRODUCTORY. XIII next described is Cintra, a village on the hills 15 miles inland, of which Byron wrote in a letter to his mother, that it united \" all the wilderness of the Western Highlands [of Scotland] with the verdure of the south of France.\" Here the poet pauses to execrate the convention, or agree- ment, by which, a year before, the British Commanders in Portugal had allowed the vanquished French to return to their own country in British ships, and free to fight the British whenever and wherever they pleased. Still adhering to his own actual route, the poet takes Harold across the S.W. parts of Spain, celebrates some of the recent victories of his countrymen in that country ; sings the charms and courage of the Spanish women ; gives some stanzas to Seville and Cadiz ; and draws an animated picture of a Spanish bull- fight. Eeference is made to the battle of Talavera (July 28, 1809), the lines of Torres Vedras (October 1810), and the victory at Albuera (May 16, 1811). This and the lament for Wingfield are excrescences upon the original work, and were, in fact, additions made to the 1st canto after the poet's return to England. The 2nd canto is a continuation of the former, less realistic and somewhat more poetical. After an invocation to PaUas, the Greek Goddess of Wisdom, the author proceeds to give the picture of a voyage from Gibraltar on board of a British warship, turning aside to sketch a lady named Mrs Spencer Smith, whom he met at Malta in September 1809. On the 29th of that month Byron landed at Prevesa, in Albania ; and the next few stanzas give a beautiful picture of that country, with an account of a visit to the Viceroy (or \"Vizier,\" as Byron calls him), and a song which is supposed to be sung by that chief's wild followers detached to guard his march to Patras. Byron then passed ten days in the Morea \u2014 the ancient Peloponnesus \u2014 visited Parnassus (apostrophised in Canto I.), and proceeded to Athens, where he passed two and a half months. Thence, on board the frigate \" Pylades \" to Smyrna"], [18, "XIV INTRODUCTORY. and the Troad. Parting at Athens from the real course of his own travels, he next conducts Harold to Constantinople ; records his admiration and sympathy for the cause of Greece, which he was to adopt as his own some ten years later ; and concludes the canto with some sad but graceful laments over the deaths of friends. These stanzas, like some in the previous canto, were added after the poet's return to England, and they present a sorrowful but genuine view of the desolation of a nature still so young, and so deeply sensitive. On the day when they were written (October 11, 1811), Byron recorded, in a letter, that he seemed to be going \" to experience in youth the greatest misery of age. Other men,\" he added, \" can always take refuge in their families : I have no resource but my own reflections, and they present no prospect here or hereafter, except the selfish satisfaction of surviving my friends.\" Such is a short account of the earlier portion of Childe Harold, the observations and thoughts of one who, as much as Chatterton, deserved the title of \" the marvellous boy.\" In the succeeding parts we are to see the boy grown into a man, without losing his claims to our wonder, and making stiU greater demands on our admiration. Canto III. Sir Walter Scott finely says of the poet that by the 1st and 2nd Cantos of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, the youthful Byron found on his head the garland for which other men of genius have toiled long, and which they have gained late. \" He was placed,\" adds the gifted and generous contemporary, \" pre-eminent among the Uterary men of his country, by gei.?ral acclamation Everything in his manner, person, and conversation tended to maintain the charm which his genius had flung around him A countenance exquisitely modelled for the expression of feeling and"], [19, "INTRODUCTORY. XV passion, and exhibiting the remarkable contrast of very dark hair and eyebrows, with light and expressive eyes the predominating expression one of deep and habitual thought the most rapid play of features when engaged in an interesting discussion, so that a brother-poet compared them to a beautiful alabaster vase only seen to perfection when Ughted up from within \"He says that, to a cursory observation, wit, gaiety, and satire, might, perhaps, appear the predominating qualities of the mind that animated this countenance. Yet those who had opportunities for a longer study were apt to arrive at the conclusion that this was only the ordinary social aspect of Byron's features, and that \" their proper language was that of melancholy.\" This is the picture drawn by a judge of character who was at once a skilful and a sympathetic artist. Ordinary people \u2014 like the lady whom Byron rashly took to wife\u2014 did not understand so mixed a character. Before he began the 3rd canto, he had passed away from youth. It should be remembered that the poet was now in his twenty-eighth year ; which, for such a man, meant early but complete manhood. His nature had, moreover, ripened under the heat of London life, and the various experience of many kinds of trouble \u2014 finding their fulfilment in loss of public esteem and haU-voluntary exile. Byron travelled through Belgium and up the Ehine, to Switzerland where he made the acquaintance of his brother poet Shelley. In a villa near Geneva, with the Shelley family for neighbours, he resided until October, varying the sameness of his life by a tour in the Bernese Oberland or Alpine chain. The 3rd canto bears the trace of aU the influences so en countered : beginning with seven stanzas of pathetic musing on his absent infant, the poet goes on to describe the pilgrim in terms undoubtedly applicable to himself ; his advance in years, his recent misfortunes, even his intimacy with Mrs Shelley's step-sister, are all more or less clearly shown. With stanza 17 he escapes for a moment from the absorp-"], [20, "INTRODUCTORY. XVI tions of self, and we have a most eloquent and pathetic passage in which are set forth the campaign of Waterloo and the fall of the great Napoleon, as reflected in the magic mirror of the poet's genius. Stanza 46 passes, by a not ill- managed transition, to the castellated rocks of the river Ehine, and its fields once foul with carnage, but now rich with wheat and wine. Stanza 72 introduces us to the Alps, and all the beauties of Swiss scenery ; snow-capped hills, green valleys, cascades, and sheets of water. The Lake of Geneva, with the neighbourhood of Meillerie and Clarens, suggests memories of Eousseau, a French author of un- doubted eloquence, as to whose intrinsic value very contrary opinions prevail. The stanzas which follow (86-108) may challenge comparison with any descriptive passage in English poetry ; they may not possess the minute accuracy of some modern writers, but their sweep and flow are unrivalled. As was observed by no mean judge, the stanzas on the storm \" present a picture of sublime terror yet of enjoyment, often attempted, but never so well brought out in poetry \" (Walter Scott). Some more stanzas about Eousseau, with whom are now associated Voltaire and Gibbon (both characterised in terms of just discrimination) lead naturally to the subject of the French Eevolution ; and Byron ends the canto \u2014 as he began \u2014 with thoughts on himself and his baby-daughter. Canto IV. If the 3rd canto was an advance on the 1st and 2nd it was in its turn eclipsed by the 4th and last. Begun at Venice in June 1817, it embodies the result of a rapid visit to Ferrara and Eome. \" I havej-een riding,\" he wrote at the time to Murray, \"and been to Albano and to Frascati Aricia, &c, about the city and in the city As a whole it beats Greece, Constantinople, everything at least"], [21, "INTRODUCTORY XVII that I have ever seen. But I cannot describe, because my impressions are always strong and confused, and my memory Selects and reduces to order like distance in a landscape.\" With this artistic faculty in full operation he ceases \u2014 except by moments \u2014 to contemplate himself, and produces views of objects chiefly, and objects on which he has turned an observant and brooding eye. In September the canto had reached 150 stanzas, and was already much longer than any of its three precursors. He had come to look upon Childe Harold as now constituting his best work ; and he thought of making it his last, adding, \" I soar I shall never do better.\" In one sense he was to do better ; for the Vision of Judgment and Don Juan are admitted by tho best critics to be more sustained and faultless in the way of workmanship. But there are passages in both these later cantos which, taken as fragments, have won the praise of all succeeding genera tions. Especially is that the case with the 4th canto, sent home in charge of the poet's old companion, Hobhouse, afterwards President of the India Board and ennobled by the title of Lord Broughton. It was published early in 1818. In the opening stanzas Byron writes of himself, but the egotism, while becoming more direct and undisguised, has lost whatever ungracofulness may be thought to cling to the earlier cantos. His feelings towards England and her people have softened : she is now \u2014 \" The inviolate island of tho sage and free ; and he associates his hopes of being remembered with her famous language ; acknowledging that no one but himself ought to be blamed for his unhappiness : \u2014 \"Tho thorns which I have reaped are of the tree 1 planted : they have torn mo, and I hleed ; I should have known what fruit would spring from such a seed.\" ' Having cleared his breast of this confession, Byron pro 1 In c. iii. st. 7, Byron had already spoken of his faults, and declared himself ready \"To food on hitter fruits without accusing Fate.\" h"], [22, "INTRODUCTORY. XVIII ceeds in the next fourteen stanzas to express the feelings ex cited in his spirit by the past and present of Venice. In stanza 25 he turns to Italy in general \u2014 the grandeur of its ruins, the beauty of its natural features. He gives an exquisite picture of moonlight on the Brenta, at the foot of the Euganean hills; describes the tomb of the Italian poet, Petrarca ; and passes on to Ferrara and the glorious but unhappy memory of Torquato Tasso. In stanzas 42, 43, he gives a musical version of the celebrated sonnet in which Filicaja addressed his country. After some thoughts thus excited, Byron goes on to touch upon the beauties and art monuments of Florence, the capital of Tuscany ; passes by the Lake of Trasimeno and the ruined temple of Clitumnus ; gives four magnificent stanzas (69-72) to the Falls of Terni ; and then, crossing the Appennine chain, finds himself in sight of Eome, the \" City of the Soul,\" \"the Niobeof nations:\"\u2014 \" Alas for Earth ; for never shall we see That brightness in her eye she bore when Rome was free.\" From stanza 87 to 107 are reflections on the monuments of ancient Eome, of which a brother-poet has given this striking account : \u2014 \" The voice of Marius could not sound more deep and solemn among the ruined arches of Carthage than the strains of the pilgrim amid the broken shrines and fallen statues of her subduer.\" So wrote Walter Scott, thinking of the wreck of Carthage by the Eomans, and of the harsh cry of the fugitive general, Caius Marius, to the messenger of the Eoman governor of Africa. Then comes another mood. The grove and fountain of Egeria yield a soft pictorial sketch, and lead for a brief space to thoughts of love ; which soon turn to sadness in the way so characteristic of the author, till the sight of the Colosseum arouses a bolder strain. Again, the chord of self sounds, but the harmony is not broken, for the note is manly and not prolonged too much. The Pantheon and St Peter's occupy from 146 to 159, with a digression upon a legend now somewhat dis-"], [23, "INTRODUCTORY. XIX credited. Some of the art-treasures of the Papal Museum in the Vatican are described, in language which has been called immortal, and will certainly be cited for a long while yet. Another digression leads to the recent mourning for the Princess Charlotte of Wales ; and the pilgrim disappears by the wooded Lake of Nemi and \"Albano's scarce-divided waves.\" Byron then stands forth, without disguise, looking upon the sea from the Alban Mount, and pouring out seven stanzas of an Address to the Ocean, which is, on the whole, a masterpiece of metrical declamation. Though by no means perfect, according to the fastidious requirements of modern taste, the poem that we have been here considering is remarkable for distinction, and a dignified melancholy. The thoughts are not often obvious nor the expressions trivial; and, when we have mastered the latter, we find the former recommended to us by our best sense of grandeur, of beauty, and \u2014 for the most part \u2014 of natural and artistic truth. Detailed remarks upon the style of the poem will be found throughout the Notes. There is hardly a stanza in which a minute criticism might not detect some flaw, either in grammar, prosody, or taste. It cannot, therefore, be truly pronounced a classic of the English language ; yet it deserves careful and constant attention, on account of its flow of diction, its manly generosity, its inspiration from books and from natural objects acting on a most powerful intellect. The author adopted the stanza of Spenser ; and, at first, something of Spenser's style. The metre had been most happily chosen, combining as it does the point and neatness of the heroic rhyme with something of the stately repose of blank verse. There are constantly recurring harmonies in each stanza of nine lines, the 1st rhyming with the 3rd, the 2nd with the 4th, 5th, and 7th, while a new rhyme connects the 6th, 8th, and 9th, which latter has an extra foot. Spenser, who was an early contemporary of Shakspere \u2014 he died"], [24, "INTRODUCTORY. XX 1599 a.d. \u2014 endeavoured to heighten the attractions of his Faery Queen by using spelling and locutions which were archaic even in his time. He had also the advantage of writing in a very unsettled state of the English language when even the few grammatical rules now adopted had not been completely laid down, and when the best writers appear to have thought more of effect than of regularity. When Byron endeavoured to imitate this licence the times had changed. Dryden, Pope, and Johnson had reduced English to almost as much form as it admitted. Byron, too, was by no means a deep scholar ; and the consequence has been that his archaisms often strike us as ungraceful and in effective. Fortunately, he seems to have felt that this was so himself ; and the effort was gradually discontinued as the poem proceeded. Many other improvements are to be observed in the 3rd and 4th cantos ; a wider reading, a deeper observation, a greater probity of description. Apart from any such peculiarities, the general manner is one of high distinction. In lieu of the minute photographic touches, by the aggregation of which a professional artist loves to produce his pictures, Byron is an \" impressionist,\" painting with a broad and sweeping brush. His extraordinary fund of words enables him to attain indirect effects, and make his reader a participant in the mental operation, whenever he chooses to exert his fuU powers. At other times he tends to become verbose, and to mix his images in a way provocative of confusion. Probably both the strength and weakness of Childe Harold's Pilgrimage are due to the excited state of the author's mind and the headlong haste with which he wrote. Thus, the 118 stanzas of Canto III. were produced while the poet was in a whirl of anger, regret, and bitter pugnacity, and were finished in six or seven weeks, during which he was makin\u00ab love sailing, travelling, and writing other poems, all at one and the same time."], [25, "TO IANTHE.

FIRST CANTO. Ianthe. The object of this dedication was a child named Charlotte Harley, daughter of Edward, fifth Earl of Oxford ; in the autumn of 1812, when these lines were written, she was in the 1 1th year of her age. She married General A. Bacon, K.T.S., of Hertfordshire. _ 1. 4, which it sighs, etc. Beauty seen in dreams alone, causing sighs of regret when one awakes and finds the unreality. 1. 7, varied as they beamed.

J. 19, Peri, a Persian word (iSj-i pari) for a fancied super human female of great beauty : hence Eng. \" fairy.\" These lines are of the nature of what is called a \" Dedication \" : a sort of metrical preface informing the reader, through the vehicle of a complimentary address to the person named,\u00b0of the feeling that is meant to be found underlying the whole work. Here, the 1st stanza preludes by assuring the young lady that, in all his travels through lands where women are famous for beauty, the poet has met none as fair as she\u2014 which may be thought an extravagant compliment to pay a child. The second stanza hopes that the girl may grow as lovely as her youth pro mises, and speaks of her mother's cares for her future. In the third, Byron recurs to his favourite notion of his own precocious maturity, though in reality not separated from the object of his address by a wider interval than commonly exists in European society between man and wife : namely, nine years. In twenty years the beauty of her youth would begin to fade ; he would be then over 40 (no great age for a man). \"All younger hearts shall bleed ; \" your friends nearer your own age will be wounded by love for you : your eyes will cause them pain from unsatisfied"], [188, "164 NOTES. longing. Meanwhile, those eyes can do him a kindness by reading his poem. She is a Lily ; may she let him use her name to decorate his work, and so make to his friendly regard for her the only possible return. 1. 27, Whose admiration shall be combined with feelings of disappointment. 1. 28, Gazelle. Gazella Dorcas : a kind of small antelope found in Syria, Arabia, and other warm countries, having eyes very large, black, and of soft expression. 1. 36, Lily. Ianthe is a fanciful derivative, compounded arbitra rily of two Greek words signifying a lily \u2014 or, more accurately, a violet \u2014 flower. He compares the coupling of this name with his poem to the inclusion of a lily in a coronal of green leaves, such as poets were depicted as wearing. Wordsworth, also addressing a child, has said : \u2014 \" My heart is at your festival, Aly head hath its coronal.\" (Intimations of Immortality.) 1. 46, Hellas. The proper name of the country of the Hellenes, called by the Italians of antiquity Graii or Gr\u00e6ci, whence the modern term \u2014 \" Greece.\" 1. 47, Muse. The Muses in Greek mythology were fabled divinities \u2014 daughters of the Sun-God and of Memory \u2014 who were held in honour as presiding over the arts. The ancient poet Homer began the practice of invoking them \u2014 or one of them \u2014 at the commencement of a poem. Among their supposed haunts was the hill \" Parnassus \" (v. inf. st. Ix.) at the southern base of which were the fountain and oracle of Delphi. 1.53, Mote. Affected antique, meaning \"must\" or \"might\" in the language of Spenser ; which in the early part especially Childe Harold seeks to imitate (u. st. 8). Whilome, \" Formerly \" (Spenser). 1. 56, Ne. \" Not \" or \" Neither \" (Spenser). 1. 57, Uncouth. \" Strange \" (Spenser). 1. 58, Night. The season of sleep; (\"drowsy\") here represented as a person disturbed by the noise of Harold's revels. 1.59, Wight. \"Creature\" (Spenser). Anglo-Saxon word of uncertain derivation. 1. 62, Concubines : Wassailers. Companions of ill-living \u2014 here called Revel \u2014 female and male. It was asserted, by the writer's friends, that this was an imaginary picture : and Byron himself always protested against the supposition that the \" Childe \" of this Canto was, in any sense, a portrait of himself. 1. 64, Childe. \" A youth of rank.\" Hight, \" named,\" or called, from Anglo-Saxon hatan ; Germ., heissen. 1. 68, Losel. \" A loose liver.\""], [189, "FIRST CANTO. 165 1. 70, Heralds . . . clay.

Eremite ; archaic for Hermit, or Solitary. 1. 88, who soon, etc. A man who would have deserted her for other companions, while he dissipated her property in wicked self-indulgence. 1. 90, Nor calm domestic peace, etc. Byron was here at least taking his own measure, however unconsciously. Whatever the immediate cause of his own subsequent matrimonial failure, there can be no doubt that his wife left him on finding his character utterly undomestic. Many idle, and some worse than idle, attempts have been made to penetrate deeper into this matter, but perhaps the only mystery about it was that it was wholly unmysterious. If a man and a woman, in a state of society that gives them equality, find themselves entirely unsuited to each other they will be very likely to part. The favourite attitude of Byron is portrayed in St. vi. Fellow bacchanals means joint worshippers of Bacchus, the ancient deity of wine. 1. 97, Visit scorching climes. He says that the Childe was so weary of the over-enjoyed pleasures of England that he was pre pared, for the sake of change, to visit the infernal regions. Byron himself at one time coutemplated a journey through Egypt to India. St. vii. is vaguely inspired by the author's country-house, New stead Abbey, near Nottingham, founded by King Henry H., 1170, and given to the Byron family by Henry VIII., 1540. It comprised a ruined church, a lake, and a dwelling-house of great size, partly ruinous in Byron's time. See 3rd line ; the house is described as \" only not falling,\" i.e. almost fallen. 1. 105, Paphian. From Paphos, now \" Basso,\" a town in the Island of Cyprus, where there was a famous temple to Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and pleasure. \" Paphian girls,\" here stand for professed singers and dancers. In a letter to Murray (dated Oct. 12, 1820) Byron describes the life led by himself and friends at Newstead in 1808, very much that of ciever boys let loose from discipline, \" buffooning all round the house in our con ventual garments.\" The youths dressed themselves up as monks, and Byron was known as \" The Abbot.\" St. viii. The hero is described as subject to moments of un accountable sadness, which sprang from some cause which his friends did not care to inquire into, nor he to explain ; he was"], [190, "166 NOTES. not one of those whose sorrows are relieved by talking of them to others. St. ix. Pursuing the subject, Byron says that his hero was not popular even among those who seemed to pay court to him while he gave them dinners. 1. 122, Leman. \" Liefman \" = dear friend. Cf. Germ., Lieber. 11. 124, Eros. Greek god of love (Latin \" Cupid\"). 1. 124, Feere. \" A companion \" (Spenser). Mammon. Riches, from a Syriac word ; used in the Christian Scripture. 1. 130, Begun, correctly \" began.\" 11. 144, Paynim, \" Pagan \" (Spenser). It has been said above that Byron originally intended to go as far as to India \u2014 central line. The Equator. 1. 147, White rocks. The chalk cliffs of Dover. Circumam bient here only means the foaming waves that surrounded the boat or ship, on which Harold was embarked, as the English shores disappeared in the increasing distance. True to his character, the Childe conceals his momentary regret at leaving his native country. 1. 153, Reckless gales. The wind that blew quite indifferent to the sufferings of the Childe's fellow passengers. See a pretty use of this word in Canto III. (St. xxx.). St. xiii. is pure imagination. No one could play a new tune and sing new words without preparation. Nor is a harp the sort of thing a passenger would be likely to carry on the deck of a ship. But of course the harp may be taken figuratively. 1. 165, The breakers, no breakers at sea, where there are no rocks for the waves to break on. 1. 166, Sea-mew. The common gull of the British coasts, \u2014 so called from its harsh cry. The sun sets in the west : the Childe was sailing south-eastward : so Alacaulay speaks of the people of Madras seeing \" the eastern sky reddened by a vast semicircle of burning villages.\" See also below, Canto II. St. Iv., where the sun is said to be seen setting behind a mountain which stood N.E. of the place from whence it was being viewed. 1. 179, Little Page. Robert Rushton, son of one of Byron's tenants, who accompanied the poet on more than one occasion. Byron sent him back from Gibraltar, begging his mother to \" show the lad every kindness.\" He allowed .\u00a325 a year for his education. 1. 203, Yeoman. William Fletcher served Byron for more than twenty years, and watched by his death-bed at Missolonghi : this, with other allusions, shows how difficult it was for Byron to separate himself and his affairs from his imaginary creations. 1. 216, Gainsay, \" gainsay \" = speaking against."], [191, "FIRST CANTO. 167 1.220, Paramour. French par amour \"by way of love\" = leman (St. Ix.). I. 226, No thing that claims a tear, i.e. nothing that one feels bound to weep for. 1. 234, Tear me where he stands.

This song is said to have been modelled on \" Lord Afaxwell's Good Night \" in Scott's Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border. It was carefully rewritten, and many weak verses were omitted. 1. 244, Biscay's sleepless bay. The Bay of Biscay is that part of the Atlantic Ocean which sweeps in from the north of Spain to the island of Ushant on the western coast of France. It is considered dangerous to mariners, by reason of the prevalence of stormy winds. 1. 247, Cintra. A beautifully situated village, 15 miles from Lisbon, surrounded by woody rocks and picturesque buildings (see St. xix.). 1. 249, Tagus. Tajo (pronounced TaJcho), the largest river of the Peninsula, rises in the Spanish range of Aluela de S. Juan, and flows by Toledo and Alcantara, into Portugal, falling into the sea 10 miles below Lisbon. In Portugal it is called Tejo. The ancient Romans believed that this river produced quantities of gold : but no such produce is recorded now. The closing couplet implies that the land at the mouth of the Tagus would yield good crops if there were more cultivation to till it : perhaps an allusion to the ravages of recent war. The pilots are natives acquainted with the rocks and shores, and licensed, or appointed, to conduct ships up the river. Lusian = \" Portuguese.\" 1. 252, Oh Christ ! . . . This or a similar invocation is used too frequently (see below, St. xl. and elsewhere). Note the false economy with regard to the not very valuable word \" goodly,\" used twice in two couplets. 1. 261, Lisboa. Formerly Olisipo, an old capital of the Lusi tanians. The \"Moors\" of Africa took the place a.d. 716 and called it, in Arabic, \" Al Oshbuna,\" whence Lisbon, or as written in the Portuguese language, \" Lisboa.\" After having been a great colonial power, the Kingdom of Portugal became, by the Treaty of 1703, a dependent ally of Great Britian. Annexed to the French Empire in 1807 the country became the seat of war in which the British took an active part, being valiantly seconded by the Portuguese. L 271, Sheening far.

Those of the rural districts were of higher character, and \u2014 under British discipline \u2014 became good soldiers. 1. 277, Cleanliness. The metre here would be better if \" cleanness \" could have been used. 1. 281, Cintra. See above, note (1. 247, n.) and Introduction. 1. 286, The bard. Dante, whose \" Divine Comedy \" is divided into three parts, the third being called \" Paradise.\" St. xix. gives promise of the poet's future descriptive skill and great power of observation. 1.288, Horrid = \" precipitous \" (old sense). 1. 291, Sunless shrubs, i.e. shrubs which, for want of sunshine, keep the dew by day, and so appear to be crying. 1. 300, Our Lady ... of woe. Nossa Senora de peiia. Byron misread the last word as Pena \" pain.\" Peiia, with the mark over the n, means a stone.

No clear meaning ; the epithet may probably mean \" land often stained with blood.\" This comes under the head of what have been called \"idealising epithets.\" Assassinations were common during the visit of Byron to Lisbon ; the poet himself was attacked in his carriage one evening ; and he stated that had he not been armed, and with armed companions, he might \" have adorned a tale in place of telling one.\" 1. 320, Vathek. Byron gives this name to Mr William Beck ford, a wealthy and eccentric Englishman who wrote a celebrated story with this title, and resided in Portugal from 1787 to 1790. Vathek was written in the French language, when the author was a very young man. There was a real Khalif of Baghdad so named. 1. 331, Pleasaunces. A \" pleasance \" is an antique word for a large garden, now usually styled \" Pleasure-ground.\" The convention of Cintra (see above, Introduction) was said to have been signed in the palace of the Alarquis of Marialva ; but"], [193, "FIRST CANTO. 169 Sir W. Napier, in his famous History of the Peninsidar War, declares that this is a complete mistake, \" the armistice, the negotiations, the convention itself, and the execution of its provisions, were all commenced, conducted, and concluded at the distance of 30 miles from Cintra, with which place they had not the slightest connection, military, political, or local.\" How ever this may be, the transaction always has been, and always will be, known by the above name. The British officers by whom it was signed were brought to trial ; \"the people of England,\" the historian tells us, \" were indignant,\" etc. The \"fiend,\" or evil spirit, crowned with \"foolscap\" \u2014 i.e. official paper \u2014 is the convention, as explained in the next stanza. The \" sable scroll \" is the document bearing the signature of the French and British officers between whom it was agreed and executed. 11. 337-8, These lines expand the metaphor : parchment (here used for paper) is a material on which treaties and agreements are written, and so assigned as the demon's dress. In St. xxv. the poet forces the feeling which the convention caused in England at the time. By the terms granted the French were thought to have retrieved their defeat. It may, however, be mentioned that their General, Junot, threatened to burn down Lisbon if these terms were withheld. Woe to the conquering, a reversal of the usual rule, is (like baffled triumph) an expression only well-founded on the assumption that the British were masters of the situation. 1. 359, Scorn . . . coming year.

The indignation of the public found expression \u2014 amongst other channels \u2014 in a pamphlet by the poet Wordsworth. Gen. Dalrymple was superseded by Sir John Moore, who after wards fell gloriously at Corunna. St. xxvii. appears to be one of Byron's frequent passages of self display. Whispered to despise, means, suggested contempt of his misspent youth. Byron travelled on horseback from Lisbon to Seville, riding 70 miles a day, and living on the plainest fare. 1. 378, Mafra, a Portuguese town, 20 miles from Lisbon, with a palace, built by King John V., 1717-31, as a rival to the Escorial of Spain.

France, represented by Alarshals Jourdain and Victor at the head of 50,000 veteran soldiers, came upon Wellesley, the British general, who commanded 19,000 troops of his own country's service and 34,000 Spaniards who did not show much energy in the encounter that ensued. The French losses amounted to about 10,000 ; those of the British were nearly half that number ; the Spanish general, Cuesta, claimed to have had 1200 killed and wounded. These figures- even accepting to the full the Spanish estimate\u2014 show a \"loss of about 1 in 28 on the side of the defenders of their own country to that of a fourth on that of their allies. The French generals received large reinforcements soon after the battle. In a note to the original edition Bvron expressed some degree of ridicule for the conduct of the British nation in aiding the Spaniards. The battle of Talavera de la Reyna, fought July 27, 28, 1809, was a struggle for Portugal, on whose border it took place. The French were repulsed so far that the British were enabled to pursue their retreat after two days of hard fighting. Byron, in the note above quoted, said \" a victory"], [196, "NOTES. 172 it was, surely, for everybody claimed it.\" It may be untrue to say that the victory was complete for the British, or the battle what is called \"decisive\": but it had at least this important result \u2014 it showed that the British troops could hold their own against any enemy in Europe.

The word is almost the same as the Sanskrit Des-pati. 1. 503, Crumble. That is, can the arbitrary ruler of a country hope to possess any of it, finally, but his grave ? A truism or a fallacy, as we chose to take it : no one \u2014 whatever his power \u2014 can possess anything when he is dead, but a despot can found a dynasty. It was for this, as much as himself, that Napoleon sought : and his line troubled France for half a century after his death. All royal lines, indeed, are traceable to conquest, unless in cases \u2014 such as modern Britain \u2014 where a foreign family has been invited to reign on conditions imposed by the people. 1. 504, The battle of Albuera was fought May 16, 1811, by Beres- ford,at theheadof 7000 British troops, with Spanish and Portuguese auxiliaries, to check the French General Soult and prevent him from relieving Badajos, then besieged by the main army under Wellington. The battle was decided by the valour of the British infantry, celebrated in the work of Napier. Next day the French fell back, and the siege proceeded. This stanza was added after the poem was finished (August 1811). The British soldiery of that day included thousands of dangerous characters recruited from the back streets and the jails. But they were superbly trained by Wellington, and did not fear to risk their lives at the call of duty. 1. 515, Scarce, scarcely, hardly. 1. 518, Blest hirelings.

Her \" lovely domes \" are the Cathedral and the Alcazar, or Moorish palace. 1. 529, Ilion. A famous city of antiquity, said to have been destroyed by the allied Greeks after a ten years' siege.

Ancient musical instruments, the former a sort of bugle, the latter a rude anticipation of the violin. The name is said to be derived from the Persian ; and this may point to the Eastern origin of the rebeck, and justify its introduction into the picture of what was once a Aloorish city. 1. 539, Kind Vice. So Shakspere, \" our pleasant vices.\" From descriptions in Byron's letters it may be inferred that the people of Cadiz did not lead ven* moral lives in his day. St. xlvii. refers to the insecurity of the rural population already noted in St. xxxi. Fandango : a dance of the Spanish peasantry, like the Bolero : kings are bid to think how much en joyment they hinder, both fur themselves and mankind at large, by waging war. St. xlviii. pursues the thought in application to the then condition of Spanish politics. \" Long live King Ferdinand !\" was the cry most heard in Spain at that time : tbe people sang songs in contempt of Ferdinand's father Charles IA\\, and of his Queen, believed to have an unlawful intimacy with a minister named Godoy, who, having concluded a treaty with France, was dignified with the title of \" Prince of the Peace.\" It was to this statesman that the Spaniards were disposed to ascribe their national misfortunes. 1. 555, Wittol : an old English word (connected with \" wit,\" or \"to wit\"), indicates a husband who knows that his wife is un faithful to him. This infamy is ascribed by Byron to the old ex-king. 1. 564, Here the bold peasant, etc. This was where brave Spanish villagers assaulted and took a Moorish stronghold.

In the spring AVellington issued from the \" Lines,\" drove the French out of Portugal, and entered on his long and arduous task of freeing the whole Peninsula. Such were the \" deeds to come \" when Byron penned this and the following stanzas. 1. 579, Howitzer. (Bohemian Haufnice \" a sling,\" in Gorman core, into Haubitze, whence the Eng. word.) A short cannon used for slinging, or throwing shells to a less distance than a mortar. They were originally intended to be quite portable. 1. 583, Holstered steed. Horse ready saddled. The cavalry saddle being provided with pistol-cases, called \" holsters,\" from a Dutch word meaning \" cover \" : the horse ready for war is said to be \"holstered.\" The balls were piled, ready also, in pyramidal form ; as is still practised in batteries. 1. 590, Attila, or Etzel, leader of the Huns, in the 5th cent. A.D., was called by a Gaulish hermit, \" The Scourge of God.\" Byron borrows the name for the Gaulish conqueror of his day. 1. 592, Gaul's Vulture. A disparaging description of the French symbol, a Roman eagle. 1. 593, Hades. Greek term for the \" Underworld,\" or supposed place of departed spirits. 1. 601, Counsel sage. The supreme Junta, or Council, was a pro visional committee, organised out of the provincial councils of Spain \u2014 principally to carry on the war \u2014 during the absence of a regular government. Originally assembled at Seville, it mi grated to Cadiz when the French obtained possession of the former city. The poet asks if it be the will of God that all the prudent deliberations of the Spanish government and all the courage of the Spanish people, the wisdom of the aged, the ardour of the young, the firm intrepidity of the mature men, are to be of no avail. 1. 603, Spanish Maid. This was Augustina, a beautiful girl who, when her lover was killed in the defence of Saragossa (1808-9), is said to have taken his place at the gun that he was working, and by her courage inspired heroism in the defenders. Alodern sceptics hold that her services were exaggerated by Byron. 1. 605, Anlace. Antique word, presumably here meant for a sword or long knife. 1. 608, Owlet's larum. \" Larum is a favourite abbreviation with Byron for ' alarum,' \" which is a form of the word \" alarm,\" from the Italian aU'arme \u2014 \"to arms.\" The cry of the owl is here compared to the call of a war-trumpet. 1. 611, Minerva. Roman goddess, presiding over mental exertion (Mens = \" mind \"). Mars: Roman deity of very ancient origin, also called G-radivus ; generally held to be the patron of war and the father of the Roman people."], [199, "FIRST CANTO. 175 The Spanish girl, once frightened if she heard the hoot of a night-bird, had learned to look unmoved upon the charge of lines of soldiers, and to walk over the corpses of the dead coverinc the field of battle. 1. 618, Saragoza. A town of Aragon, in Northern Spain (C\u0153sarea-Augusta), founded by the Romans, 25 B.C., and twice besieged by the French in the Peninsular war. Danger, said to have a \" Gorgon face \" from the fable in Greek mythology of a woman \u2014 or female monster \u2014 whose aspect turned her beholders into stone. Augustina's superiority to the petrifying power of danger is thus tersely and powerfully expressed. St. lvi. goes on to say :\u2014 She does not find time to weep when her intended husband is hurt in battle or his leader killed. If her companions wive way she stays their flight ; if the enemy do so she ur\u00abes\u00b0the pursuit. And yet she belongs to a nation in which the women are wont to be as loving as elsewhere, and certainly not less lovely. They excel the talkative female creatures of other countries in every aspect of character, as affectionate as they are, and possessed of greater courage. 1. 633, Phalanx A line or square of men disposed for battle (Greek). 1. 639-41, The dimple, or imprint of a loving finger is com- pared to the seal on a writing. The ladies' mouths are ready to kiss their lovers, but only on condition that tbe lovers be brave. The Sun that loves them is a model for the men that would win their love, etc. \u2014 It is all exaggeration, but we must remember how very young the writer was. Byron celebrates tbe beauty of Spanish women in a passage hardly worthy of a great poet. Harem (Arab. Hardm), the \" forbidden,\" or private apartment of an eastern house. Houries : Hur = \" black-eyed,\" the nymphs of the Muslim Paradise. Whom ye scarce allow, etc. This refers to the jealous seclusion\u2014 pardah \u2014 of Eastern families. \u2014 Wise Prophet. It is suggested that the founder of Islam taught his followers to look for \" Houries \" in Paradise as a prudent way of inviting converts. 1. 657, Parnassus. A mountain in Greece, formerly held sacred to Apollo and the Aluses. (See above, 1. 47, n.) It was December 1809 when Byron crossed the gulf of Lepanto and visited Parnassus, which he addresses in these noble lines (Stt. lx.-lxiv.). 1. 667, Poetry is here spoken of. 1. 683, The \" melodious wave \" is Castalia, a spring on the slope of the mountain, a little above Delphi, where the shrine and oracle were. Its waters were held to have a purifying quality for those who bathed in them, while to drink them procured poetic inspiration."], [200, "176 NOTES. 1. 691, Daphne. A nymph beloved by Apollo and changed into a laurel-tree (Laurus nobilis) : the plant became consecrated to the god ; and its boughs, bearing berries, were used to crown victorious heroes and successful poets, thus placing them under the patronage and favour of the Sun, personified in Apollo. It is difficult to account for the origin of this story, which perhaps survives from some old Aryan form of tree-worship, and may remind us of the sanctity of the tulsi (ozymum sanctum) in India. In this address to Parnassus tbe poet is to be understood as congratulating himself that he actually sees the sacred scenes that other writers only fancy. For the Muses see above, n. (6). The melodious wave over which the \" gentle spirit \" of poetry is supposed to glide, refers to the water at the foot of the holy mountain. In St. lxiii. he expands the topic, and explains its introduction here. The leaf of Daphne's deathless plant is that of the bay laurel, into which, as the fable ran, the nymph had been turned (see above). In St. Ixiv. he returns to the Spanish ladies aud their charms. The mountain, in its most glorious days, was never surrounded by more beautiful forms ; and he only wishes tbat Spain were now as peaceful as Greece, inglorious as that country then might be. An able critic has noted that, if Byron wrote these lines \u2014 as he records \u2014 at Delphi, he has made them \" a curious instance of poetical adaptation\" ; as Parnassus is not visible from thence. The truth is, that minute accuracy has only recently been regarded as essential to poetry or to any other art. 1. 702, Seville . . . Cadiz. Cities of Andalusia : see above 1. 601, n. Cadiz, one of the most ancient sites in Europe, was a city of the old Ph\u0153nician merchants about 1 100 B.C. It was blockaded by the French for more than two years, when the Supreme Junta had taken refuge there ; but was open to the sea, and finally quite set free in consequence of the victories of the British armies in Andalusia, August 25, 1812. 1. 709, Bv the strange compound of \"a cherub-hydra,\" Byron means to describe Vice as a combination of the angel and the serpent. Cherub is from the Hebrew, and Hydra (a water-monster with many heads) is from Greek mythology. 1. 711, Paphos. See above, n. (18). 1. 714, Venus . . . Sea. Venus is the Latin deity of love's pleasures, called by the Greeks Aphrodite, from two words meaning \" sprung from the foam \" ; it being fabled that the goddess was born in the sea. 1. 723, Quaint.

A word of Celtic origin. Used in Hamlet, I. 153. 1. 726, The poet resumes the subject of the dissipated life led at Cadiz : where the formal observations of church ceremonies took the place of religion and morality. 1. 729, Saturday was the Jewish day of rest, caUed in their tongue \" Sabbath,\" = Seventh. The name was transferred to Sunday, .he 1st day of the week, in England and Scotland, about the time of the Reformation (16th cent. A.D.). In the latter country the use of the word became a substantial part of religion : and Byron, in adopting it, may have been influenced by his early Scottish training. In the next twelve stanzas the young poet contrasts the Sunday of Spain with that of his native island, especially as observed by Londoners of his time, \u2014 the peaceful visits to the suburbs with the excitement of a bull-fight. 1. 738, The seventh day. Rather \" the first.\" Jubilee. A season of festivity : from Heb. Yobel = \" trumpet,\" because the Jews proclaimed a festival every 50 years, by sound of brass instruments. 1. 741, Smug = affectedly neat. 1. 742, Coach of Hackney.

To this the poet aUudes in the last lines of the stanza. Aloore considered this passage (lxix., lxx.) as a disfigure ment to the canto. St. lxxii.-lxxix.

Duenna, an elder woman taking care of a young lady.

This is known as \" improvisation \" ; but it is more common among the Italians than with the Northern nations. 1. 882, To Inez : an imaginary person probably ; no Spanish woman would be likely to understand English poetry.

I. 902, What exile, etc. ? Translated from the Roman poet, Horace, Od. ii. 16. This song shows the young writer in his most artificial aspect. The attitude of a worn-out follower of pleasure was fashionable at the time. Byron records that he wrote it in January 1810. It was substituted for a livelier and more natural lyric, in praise of the \" dark-eyed girl of Cadiz.\" The style, however, is studiously simple, as above noted. 1. 924, A Traitor. Solano, Governor of Cadiz, murdered by the people on account of his French sympathies, in Alay 1809. The long and loyal defence of Cadiz has been already mentioned (1. 702, n.). 1. 926, Fallen Chivalry : a fresh allusion to the supposed treach ery of the Governor, who belonged to the class of Nobles or Knights. 1. 929, Kingless : nerveless.

St. lxxxvii. Referring once more to the valiant but vin dictive resistance of the Spaniards to French conquest, English writers of the time assert that, though inefficient in regular war fare, the Spaniards harassed the French, cutting off detachments and killing solitary stragglers and travellers.

Except Stanzas xliii., xci., xcii., this canto was finished at Athens December 30, 1809. St. ii. In place of the Aluse, Byron now invokes the blue eyed goddess of wisdom, Athene, or Pallas : Wisdom, he insinu ates, isnot the inspirer of Poets : but the goddess was the patroness of the city of Athens where he was living from the end of 1809 to March 9, 1810, when most of this Canto was composed. The Parthenon, whose ruins are still standing on the top of the Acro polis, or central bill of Athens, was the temple of Pallas, but not an object of interest to the Alussulmans who then held possession of the place and surrounding country. Up to the year 1667, the buildings on the Acropolis were entire ; but were after that date much damaged by the cannonading of besiegers. The greatest mischief was done by the Venetians until Lord Elgin removed the sculptures. St. ii. The great men of Athens, \u00c6schylus, Perides, Plato, Demosthenes, and others, were among the most famous that the earth has known, from the Persian war (480 B.C.) to the battle of Cheronea (338 B.C.). We now, says Byron, are unable to trace the monuments or the local traditions of the great soldiers or wise men of those old days. 1. 10, Athena, apparently meant for \"Athens,\" the Latin of which, however, is Athen\u00e6 (see below, St. vii.). The goddess would be called \" Athene \" in Greek, but was usually known to Byron by the name of the corresponding Roman divinity \"Minerva.\" Byron wrote a separate piece on the subject of the spoliation of the Parthenon, under the title of \" The Curse of Minerva.\" The distinction between Greek and Roman deities was not ob served in his time. 1. 16, Sophist stole. \"Sophist\" is an unfriendly word for a Greek sage ; the \" stole \" was his gown. 1. 19, Son of the morning. What this means is not by any"], [207, "SECOND CANTO. 183 means clear. Perhaps an appeal to himself and reader as the heirs of a civilisation that was just dawning upon the night of darker ages. Shrines . . . burn, whose places of worship\"have ceased to smoke with incense. 'Twas Jove's = Jove, or Jupiter, the chief deity of the Romans, here used to denote pagan worship in general. Mahomet's : a Mahoniedan mosque. Poor child, etc : Alan is certain of nothing but that he wUl die, and his religions are all alike, without foundation. St. iv. Alan looks away from his native planet as if to find a promise of life after death. Surely, the poet says, the miseries of his present existence are enough'to dissuade him from desiring another. St. v. Byron turns to the tomb of Ajax, a Grecian hero buried in Troas, contrasting the grief, which must have been general when such a \"mound\" was raised, with the present neglect and loneliness of the place. He then proceeds to moralise upon a human head from which the hair, and flesh, and all that made it beautiful, have long since vanished. The ancient Greeks\u2014 like most early Aryan races\u2014 practised cremation. 1. 38, Far, on the solitary shore. The hero buried at a distance from his Grecian home, on the coast of the Trojan Sea. St. vi. A powerful picture of the skull as a tenement of the soul, now in ruins. 1. 55, Well . . . son. Perhaps Socrates : but he was not really what is now called \" an agnostic \" : he only affected ignorance as a means of controversy. He was, however, condemned and put to death by his countrymen on a charge of being opposed to the State religion. 1. 61, Shores of Acheron. A fabled stream of the lower regions ; the meaning is, when we have reached the limit of this life we fall into silent slumber\u2014 the Nirvana of the Buddhists. St. viii. Notice the solemn piety of this passage. L 62, Forced banquet. Refers to the curse of those who have more than they want\u2014 of anything. Shelley speaks of \" Love's sad satiety.\" 1. 66, Sadducee : among the ancient Jews, the orthodox believers who denied a future life. 1. 72, Zoroasteris The Bactrian, Spitama,also called Zarathush tra: the supposed author of the Avesta, or ancient Persian Scriptures. 1. 72, The Samian sage. Pythagoras, born at Samos (an island off the coast of Asia Alinor) about 581 B.C., celebrated in ancient Greece as a mathematician and moral teacher. St. ix. is addressed to the memory of a young Cambridge friend, named Eddleston, for whom Byron had the warmest affection. Originally a chorister, or singer in a church, he went into business in London, and died of consumption 1811. This"], [208, "184 NOTES. regard of the proud Byron for a friend so much beneath him in rank is noticeable. 1. 84, Son of Saturn. The apostrophe is to Zeus Olympius. Saturn was an Italian deity, fabled to be the father of Jupiter, to whom Zeus answers in Greek mythology. His temple's ruins lie on the Acropolis. 1. 90, light Greek. Refers to the levity which seemed to be the characteristic of the modern Athenians. 1. 92, Pallas lingered. An imaginative phrase for the Parthenon. The dull spoiler is meant for the seventh Earl of Elgin, to whose enlightened energy the British Museum is indebted for the possession of the sculptures from the Parthenon, which have done so much to raise and instruct the public taste in sculpture. Byron blames him ; but the sculptures were neither safe nor accessible at Athens when Elgin removed them. Whether they might not be restored now that Greece has a settled and a civilised government, is another matter. 1. 96, England! Byron rejoices that he was not born in Scotland : which little country, however, had much to do with the formation of his character, besides being the place of his mother's birth and ancestry (see Introduction). 1. 99, The British ship was delayed by storm. 1. 100, Modern Pict. A jibe at Elgin's northern origin. The \" Picts \" were an old people of the eastern part of what is now called Scotland, the Scots being a race of Irish visitors on the west with whom the Picts sometimes fought and finally united. Byron supposes the Athenians to have felt the departure of the \" Elgin marbles \" so acutely that they may be said never to have appreciated the full weight of the Turkish dominion before. The next two stanzas are devoted to the same complaint. Despot (see above, I. 1. 501, n.). Eld : Spenserian for \"antiquity.\" 1. 118, Aegis . . . Peleus' son. Pallas was fabled to wear a breast plate made from the hide of the goat Amalthea, decorated with the head or mask of the Gorgon (see above, I. n. 91). Alaric, a Gothic leader, took Rome in the early part of the 5th cent. a.d. According to Zosimus, a contemporary historian, Alaric was scared away from the Acropolis by the united efforts of Pallas and Achilles (the son of Peleus), who could not be brought to interpose a second time when Lord Elgin and his men removed the marbles. Afresh lament over the same subject. St. xvi. A new allusion to the Childe's precocious superiority to ordinary human weaknesses. To urge, i.e. to follow his course. The next few stanzas contain a spirited description of a voyage from Gibraltar, on board a vessel of war, in the days of"], [209, "SECOND CANTO. 185 sailing ships. Frigate : this was a word borrowed from the French to denote a ship of size and strength secondary to the \" man-of-war \"or first-rate ship, though rigged on the same principles. Convoy, the collection of mercantile vessels sailing under the frigate's protection : the slower vessels \u2014 so favourable was the wind \u2014 contrived to keep up by tacking (or \" wearing \"). 1. 148, tight. A nautical phrase by which sailors express their sense of a vessel being in good order. 1. 155, Well-reeved refers to the ropes by which the frigate's cannon were fastened to their places in the battery, with a netting to keep off the fall of splinters in action. 1. 158, Boatswain (pronounced \"Bosun\"): the chief petty officer, immediately responsible for the crew's discipline. 1. 160, Midshipman: a young probationer or naval cadet on board a war ship, learning the duty of an officer, and exercising an officer's power in a subordinate degree. Alidshipmen are often employed in command of the ship's boats when detached for service. 1. 161, Shrill pipe: the youthful voice exerted beyond its natural pitch becomes sharp, either in reproof or encouragement, but is obeyed by the well-trained seamen. St. xix. sets before us the deck, clean and polished, on which walk the officer of the watch and, elsewhere, the com- manding officer, who does not join in general intercourse. Which broken, etc. If the restraint imposed by discipline on board a man-of-war were shattered the captain could not hope for professional success. The strict obedience to discipline has often been shown in the battles and shipwrecks of the Royal Navy. [The last line ran : \u2014 \"From discipline's stern law\" \u2014 in the poet's original MS.] St. xx. The frigate \u2014 her name was The Hyperion \u2014 had better sailing qualities than the ships of the convoy ; and she had to halt at sunset in order that they might come up.

Solitary meditations by moonlight lead Byron to his customary mood of melancholy. 1. 201, Mourner . . . zeal.

Another name for \" the moon.\" 1. 215, A flashing pang. Sir Walter Scott has described the sudden look of pain that was sometimes seen to pass over Byron's face. Byron was much addicted to lonely wandering and \u2014 as he said \u2014 \" gazing upon the sky and the waters.\" The value of such hours is dependent on a man's character and intellect : not many would make the use of them that he did. In St. xxvi. the poet contrasts his lonely musings (when \u2014 personifying the world of material objects \u2014 he declares that \" Nature \" was his companion) with the virtual solitude which he found when surrounded by people with whom he was not in sympathy : and who \u2014 however they might try to be agreeable when he was present \u2014 would not cease to look happy when he was dead. Minions of splendour. \" Minion \" (from mignon) = darling ; and so, a spoiled child : such an one shrinks from contact with the pain of another. 1. 236, Athos. The easternmost point of the peninsula of Salonica, at the head of the Sea of Greece called the Archipelago, formerly the \u00c6gean. It is known as the residence of numerous religious ascetics who, though Christians, are tolerated by the Turkish Government, to which they pay an annual tribute. 1. 240, Wistful. \" AVith earnest longing.\" 11. 244, p. f. A rapid sketch of life at sea in the man-of-war described as a \" winged citadel,\" or fortress. 1. 246, the tack. A ship's course altered by a shift of the sails. 1. 253, Calypso's Isles. There is only one island so called ; namely Gozo, supposed to be the Ogygia of the ancients : it is 4 miles N.N.W. of Malta, of which it is a dependency. Calypso was fabled as a nymph who lived there, and when Odysseus (Latin, Ulysses), chief of Ithaca, was thrown on her island, endeavoured to persuade him to become her husband. On searching for his father, Telemachus, son of Odysseus, is sup posed to have come there, with his tutor. 1. 265, A new Calypso. Byron made, at Malta, the acquaintance of a lady born at Constantinople, of Austrian parentage, married to an English diplomatist (Mr Spencer Smith), and honoured by the hostility of the great Napoleon. Byron addressed her in several pieces of verse, among them one containing the following stanza \u2014 written in Greece \u2014 which attracted the special praise of the poet Moore : \u2014 \" Then think upon Calypso's isle, Endeared by days gone by ; To others give a thousand smiles, To me a single sigh.\""], [211, "SECOND CANTO. 187 St. xxxL In this and the next three stanzas Byron, painting himself in his hero, boasts that \u2014 to tbe lady's astonishment \u2014 he could admire her attractions without yielding to them so far as to become her lover. Who knew his votary, etc. Cupid, the God of Love, had often seen this worshipper captured after apparent escape. We may look on the passage, it is most likely, as a mere piece of social and literary sport. 1. 280, The lady is supposed to have thought that if the Childe did not feel what is called \" love,\" he should have at least pre tended to do so. St. xxxiii. This stanza is one of those in which Byron takes pleasure in misrepresenting himself through the mask of his hero. The poet was much annoyed when the public ultimately took him at his word. 1. 291, Harold is said to have been an expert in the game of snaring ladies. 1. 297, Whining crew. The band of complaining wooers. 1. 307, Approves. Proves. The next two are not much more to the poet's credit, a con cession perhaps to the taste of the day, but not palatable now. They contain, however, a moral that is not without instruc tion. 1. 316, The poet is reminded that he has been digressing, and must return to his theme, which is the travel of his hero and the scenery of Greece. 1. 319, led, says the poet, by solemn reflection on real scenes. 1. 322, Utopia. \" Nowhere ; \" the landscape of the Imagination. 1. 322, Ared : presumably intended as an archaism for \" read.\" In old English the meaning would be rather \"advised,\" from rede \" advice \" with participial prefix. It is, however, used by Spenser in the former sense. 1. 324, Ever such. \" Could ever be taught such [lessons].\" 1. 325, Nature. See above, n. to st. xxvi. Byron now per sonifies the material world as a mother, from whose breast he has never been \" weaned, \" or taught to do without it : he professes to have seen this parent in moods not revealed to other men, and to havejbeen best pleased with her when those moods were most angry \u2014 such as are shown in earthquakes and hurricanes \u2014 which is hard to believe. 1. 334, Albania. A western province of Turkey, inhabited by a half-civilised people, where the Childe is supposed to land. 1. 334, Iskander : the \" Scanderbeg \" of European historians ; an Albanian named George Branilo, who deserted from the Turkish army about 1443 a.d., and for twenty-five years waged successful rebellion against his former masters. He died a natural death in 1468, when the rebellion was suppressed. The"], [212, "188 NOTES. Albanians were then Greek Christians, but have since\u2014 for the most part \u2014 embraced Islam. His namesake, Scanderbeg bore the same as that which Orientals give to Alexander the Great who was born (350 B.C.) in the same regions, and has become a theme, or topic, for young hero-worshippers, though wise men avoid his errors. Poets have called him \" Macedonia's madman.' 1. 339, The cross : i.e. Christianity has fallen ; The towers arise from which the Aziin is recited by Muslims (i\\ below, 530, n.). 1. 343, The barren spot.

The latter was defeated, and Octavius became master of the Roman Empire. 1. 356, Lepanto : another neighbouring inlet, the scene of the defeat of the Turkish fleet by the ships of the Christians under Don John of Austria, Oct. 7, 1571. 1. 356, Trafalgar : on the S.W. coast of Spain, between Cadiz and Gibraltar, famous for the defeat of the united French and Spanish fleets by Nelson, Oct. 21, 1805. Childe Harold is here described as indifferent to scenes of war, and looking at the place of Sappho's suicide with far greater interest. 1. 371, Suli is on the coast. Pindus, a mountain chain a few miles in the interior : the highest peak of Pindus is in the terri tory now belonging to the modern kingdom of Greece, which was not created until after Byron's death. Pindus is 7111 ft. in height, and is regarded as a spur of the Balkan range. St. xliii. The Childe is supposed to land, as Byron did, at Prevesa on the Albanian coast.

Octavius called himself C\u00e6sar-Augustus after obtaining the Em pire : \"C\u00e6sar\" being the family name of his predecessor, while \"Augustus\" implied good omens. The trophies are the ruins of Nicopolis, a city built by the conqueror, in the neighbourhood, to commemorate his victory. Byron landed at Prevesa, Sept. 29, 1809 ; went through Arta to Yanina (the chief town), which he reached Oct. 9 ; and, after his visit to Ali Pasha, returned to Yanina, where he passed the last week of October, and began the present poem. Primal town : Yanina, or Joannina. 1. 407, Illyria : an ancient name for the east side of the Adriatic, revived by Napoleon, Emperor of the French, at the time of Byron's visit G809). It can hardly by any stretching be made to include any part of Albania, though the French at one time had a garrison in Prevesa (see St. lxxii., song, verse 8). 1. 411, fair Tempe. Tempe was the name of a gorge, or pass, in the N.W. of the province of Thessaly in Greece ; through which the river Peneus flowed, and formed fertile banks, with abundant vegetation . 1. 415, Pindus: an offshoot of the Balkan chain of mountains separating Epirus from Thessaly, v. 371, n.

Ali Pasha, Ariceroy of the Province, an able Albanian adventurer, born at Tepaleni \u2014 the place where he was stiU residing when Byron visited him 68 years later. In 1797 he joined Napoleon, but next year expelled the French garrison. He ruled his province with justice, though somewhat severe ; and did not shrink from any bloodshed which he deemed requisite. At the time of Byron's visit, he was virtually an in dependent ruler, and remained so for many years. At length, in 1820, when he was nearly 80 years old, the Turkish Sultan sent an overwhelming force against Ali. He surrendered, on a promise that was not fulfilled ; and was put to death Feb. 5, 1822. He took Suli, by bribes, after 18 years' siege. 1. 424, Zitza. A hill-top which Byron crossed in a violent thunder-storm, Oct. 10. It is, in fair weather, a journey of four hours from Yanina."], [214, "190 NOTES. 1. 436, of dignity. This hill might be thought important, were it not dwarfed by its neighbours. 1. 438, Caloyer : a word for a monk, or inmate of a monastery, in modern Greek. The poet here uses the word convent, which is usually in English reserved for a house of religious ladies. We hear from Byron's travelling companion Hobhouse much praise of the monks and their prior, who received the English travellers with simple but willing hospitality. St. I. gives a pleasant picture of a resting-place on the cool summit of Zitza. 1. 445, From heaven itself, etc. On these hill-tops the air blows untainted by human habitations, and contains no germs of sick ness. Such a feeling would be peculiarly excited after a storm such as Byron passed through in ascending. 1. 448, impregnate. For \"impregnated.\" 1. 453, Chimaera's Alps. This is a little spur of Pindus, running down towards the sea, properly \" Chimare.\" At the foot of these hills the river Acheron runs through the lake Acherusia and falls into the sea opposite the island of Paxo. The name of this river was borrowed in the infernal geography of the Greeks : it is now known as the Kalamas. The place was once the scene of a volcano. The last line of St. li. originally began, \" Keep heaven for better souls ; my shade,\" etc. The meaning of the words as they now stand is less clear ; but the general idea seems the same. 1. 459, Acheron was once the sacred river of the dead : and 0 Pluto, god of the infernal regions, if this be thy realm, I will not seek any better place of rest for my soul. The scene is beautifully described in St. Iii. The capote re fers to a kind of mantle worn by Albanian peasants on the hill sides in cold weather. 1. 469, Dodona. An ancient shrine of Zeus, whose ruins are not far from Yanina. The stanza refers to the scanty traces left of a place once so famous : telling man not to murmur at his frail tenure, since even the shrines of deity leave so little permanent a mark. 1. 478, Epirus : here used as a name for the coast, as distinct from the district of Albania Proper, from which the poet sup poses himself to be separated by the hills he has crossed. The border-village is Delvinachi. 1.481, Yclad: \"clothed.\" The old Saxon form of the past participle. 1. 487, Tomerit : anciently Mount Tomarus, a peak of the Pindus, near Dodona ; on which Tepaleni stands. Laos : a mountain-stream near which Tepaleni is situated. Byron, who"], [215, "SECOND CANTO. 191 saw it ill an exceptional flood, thought it \"the finest river in the Levant.\" 1. 492, Tepalen : the favourite residence of Ali, who was born there, as mentioned in n.

Byron's love of children is often expressed in the poem, aud was sometimes shown in his conduct. 1. 554, Ali : (see above, n. 47). The poet means to say : \u2014 \" His face is that of an old man of so gentle an appearance that casual visitors would fail to perceive signs of the bloody deeds with which his reputation is marked.\" 1. 549, Byron explains that Ali's character is not only stained by a sensuality unbecoming his age \u2014 he was then 68 \u2014 but that his cruelty and readiness to take human life grew worse as he advanced in years. 1. 561, Hafiz : a native of Shiraz, whose name was Shams-ul-din Aluhamad, d. 791 a.h., in the 14th cent, of the Christian era.

Blood . . . blood. The poet had a just prevision of the end of such a career : Ali was decapitated in the very palace where he had received Byron's visit thus described : \u2014 \" He received me in a large room paved with marble ; a fountain was playing in the centre ; the apartment was surrounded by scarlet ottomans \" (Letters). St. lxv. In an Appendix to the collected (one vol.) edition of Byron's Poems (Murray, 1837) will be found a long Note (B ) on the Albanians as Byron had time and means for knowing them. \" As far as my experience goes,\" he writes, \" I can speak favourably . . . The Albanians have a fine cast of countenance ... on foot they are not to be subdued by fatigue.\" Byron kept one in his service until he left Greece in May 1811. \"They are esteemed the best troops in the Turkish service \" [same Letter, Nov- ember 12, 1809]. 1. 591, In sailing down the coast Byron was nearly wrecked off Suli, where \" we landed,\" he says, \" and proceeded, by the help of the natives, to Prevesa again.\" The Albanians who showed the poet such hospitality \" refused any compensation but a written paper stating that I was well received \" [same Letter]. 1. 592, When less babarians. ...

Frank : Christians called Faringhi throughout the East ; the word is a corruption of \" Frank \" or Frenchman, men of that nation having been conspicuous during the Crusades. 1. 612, Lesson happier men. Such treatment of distressed voyagers may teach a \"lesson\" to people more prosperously placed ; and at least make wicked men ashamed of themselves. St. lxix. Byron still describes his own adventures. \" I am going to-morrow,\" he writes on November 12, \" to Patras, in the Morea, with a guard of fifty men.\" 1. 621, \u00c6tolia : a district of ancient Greece forming the N. shore of the Gulf of Corinth, and parted from Acarnania (the south of Epirus) by the river Aspropotamos, known to the ancients as the 1. 620, Achelous : at its mouth are deposits of silt forming malarious marshes, on which stands the town of Alissolonghi ; here Byron was destined to die some eleven years later. 622, Utraikey : viUage on a smaU bay called Leutraki, near Actium ; 'whither the poet, somewhat abruptly, reverts. He was there November 14, and wrote the lines beginning : \u2014 \" Through cloudless skies, in silvery sheen, Full beams the moon on Actium's coast \" (to be found at p. 544 of the Works). But this was before his march to Alissolonghi, which he did not reach till the 21st. U. 631 ff., The amusements of the guard at night are described in St. lxxi.

He did not find any vulgarity hi the enjoyment of these unfamiliar men. The song which follows is said in Byron's own note to have heen pieced together from fragments of what the men actually sang, as interpreted to him. The stanzas are supposed to be addressed to a drummer. 1. 651, Tambour is French for \" drum,\" and the termination is a common Turkish one for the official user of an instrument or weapon : thus, the Master of the Ordnance was called Topji Bashi.

The French garrisoned the place in 1797, but Ali drove them out a year later and plundered the inhabitants. 1. 685, v. 10, Muchtar : Mukhtyar Pasha, a Turkish chief. 1. 686, Yellow-haired giaours : the Russians. Byron wrote a poem called \" The Giaour,\" published soon after Childe Harold, I., II. The word means \" unbeliever,\" and is applied in Turkey to the Christians. Horse-tail : standard of a Pasha. 1. 687, Delhi : Turkish troops so-caUed. The word in Turkish means \" mad.\" 1. 689, Selictar : said by Byron to mean \" sword-bearer.\" St. lxxiii. Greece was then in the possession of the Osmanli Turks, whose oppressive yet neglectful treatment of subject races is well known. \" Immortal, though no more,\" etc., means that though she has ceased to be a nation she is still remembered and admired on account of her past history. Byron lived to devote himself to her cause ; and great part of Greece is now independent, under a Christian king. 1. 679, Thermopylae : a pass where the Spartan King and three hundred of his followers fell in opposing the advance of the Persian army of invasion, 480 B.C. 1. 701, Eurotas ; now caUed the Iri, or Vasilo : the river on which ancient Sparta stood. 1. 702, Phyle.

A patriot and general of Athens, who overthrew the \" Thirty Tyrants \" of that city ; allusion to the story of the conquest of Athens by the Lacedajmonians under Lysander, who appointed these \" Thirty Tyrants \" as a committee to administer the affairs of Athens. Thrasybulus collected an army and attacked them with success, 402 b.c. The poet reproaches the modern Greeks with not resisting the Osmanlis, who are many more than thirty. Byron proved that his sym pathy with the cause of Greece went beyond words. He speaks of their fine figures and good looks, asking whether these may not be taken as signs of coming independence."], [219, "SECOND CANTO. 195 1. 720, Hereditary bondsmen, etc. A fine couplet, often quoted. 1. 723 ff., Will the French or Russians deliver the Greeks from Turkish rule 1 The poet says they may perhaps conquer the Turks, but it wiU be in their own interest. The singular sagacity of the young politician was partly justified in after years. On 20th October 1827 the Turkish Fleet was entirely destroyed by the combined forces of Russia, France, and Great Britain. But the jealousies of the Western powers have to this day prevented the fulfilment of Russian aims. 1. 726, Helots. In the Peloponnesus, as in many countries, a stratum of ancient races appears to have been overpowered and oppressed by conquering invaders. The treatment of the Helots in Sparta was proverbially insolent and cruel, but they never rose. 1. 729, Allah. The Aluslim deity. 1. 730, Othman : or Osman. Founder of the \" Osmanli \" line still ruling at Constantinople. 1. 731, Serai; the palace of the Turkish Sultan. 1. 733, Wahab ; founder of the sect of Wahhabis, who seized Alecca and Aledina in 1803 a.d., but were finally expelled by the Turkish government, their leader Abdulla being taken and sent to Constantinople, where he was publicly executed as a rebel, Dec. 19, 1818. Byron thinks that the AVahhabis \u2014 who were unconquered when he was writing \u2014 might overthrow the Osmanli power, but would not free the Greeks. St. lxxviii. describes the Greek Carnival, or festivity before the Christian fast of Lent. St. lxxix. Byron here takes leave of his hero, whom he sends straight on to Stamboul, or Constantinople. He himself went from Athens to Smyrna and the Troad (see preliminary Analysis). 1. 749, Sophia ; \"Divine Wisdom ; \" to whom was dedicated the great Church of Constantinople built by the Emperor Justinian about 540 a.d. It is now used as a mosque. 1. 755, Bosphorus : properly Boos Poros, = \" Bull's ferry,\" from a fabled crossing by Zeus in the disguise of a bull. Constantinople stands on its western shore. Byron laments that the Greeks are not now sincere in their rejoicings, but yet admits that he \u2014 speaking in his own person rather than the Childe's \u2014 took much pleasure in the scene presented by the city and its surround ings. There was an incessant sound of music, accompanied by the plash of waves on oars and boats. The Queen of Tides is, of course, the moon : there is no tide in the Central Alediterranean, but in the neighbourhood of Constantinople the tide though slight is perceptible. Compare Shakspere ; \" the star upon"], [220, "196 NOTES. whose influence Nature's empire stands.\" \u2014 Hamlet. Consenting. The moon is supposed to make harmony with the hour's soft sounds : an unsual use of the word : perhaps from the Latin con census = \" singing together.\" The effect of a wind partiug the clouds is prettily painted in Byron's broad manner. 1. 765, Caique. Turkish boat, so-called in French (Turk. Kaik). The stanza celebrates the hours of youth's enjoyment, which the poet (vainly perhaps) regards as the sole compensation for the cares of life. In the next st. Byron proceeds to ask : \u2014 whether, even in such hours, the Greek patriot would not rather be dead and buried. Searment is a misapplication of a word used for \" raiment,\" and seems of a piece with the somewhat artificial character of the whole passage. The usual spelling \" cerement,\" meaning the wax-cloth in which a corpse was wrapped. 1. 786, The bondsman's peace : the escape from conflict of a slave who submits to a foreign yoke and pretends to like it. He says that the natives of Greece, in spite of their noble origin, are less attached to their country than foreigners. It should be re membered that the ancient Greeks, though an artistic people, were not very famous for virtue. In self-defence they united on the occasion of the Persians invading their country under Xerxes, and behaved with courage. But the rest of their history is chiefly one of intestine quarrels, not unmarked by treachery and wanton bloodshed. 1. 792, Lacedaemon. The people of Sparta, in the south of the Peloponnesus \u2014 whose treatment of the subjugated aborigines has been already noted \u2014 were famous for self-denial and valour : \" Spartan firmness \" is still a proverbial phrase. 1. 793, Thebes : the capital of B\u0153otia, which \u2014 under Epanri nondas and Pelopidas \u2014 shook the power of Sparta at the battle of Leuctra (370 B.C.), and established a brief Theban supremacy. 1. 797, A thousand years, etc. Byron thinks that the rise of States is many thousand times more gradual than their fall ; a view hardly borne out by history. In St. lxxxv. the poet praises the beauty of tbe country, adding that the ruins of her ancient monuments mix by degrees with the soil once trodden by heroes, as the rural labourers break it up. Share : the plough-share, or blade. 1. 811, The Cave. The marble-quarry of Alt.

[Hippocrates ; 460 to 357 B.C.] St. xc. The poet pictures the scene as he sees it in imagina tion on the spot. He says, in Don Juan : \u2014 \" The mountains look on Alarathon \u2014 And Alarathon looks on the sea ; And, musing there an hour alone, I dreamed that Greece might still be free.\" [Works, p. 637.] The supposed scene of the battle was offered to Byron for \u00a3900. There was a barrow, or mound, on the field, but no relics have been dug out of it ; and the very site has been dis puted since Byron's time. In St. xci. Byron foretells that Alarathon will long continue an interesting resort of tourists. The meaning of \" Ionian blast\" is not clear, but would seem to apply to some wind of the neighbourhood, blowing from the west (where the Ionian isles are) and useful to visitors in sailing-boats. St. xcii. If you have kinsfolk at home you will not perhaps care to travel so far. But for a single man it is just the very place, being sorrowful as his mood may be.

[Works, 549, where is the following pathetic verse on the occasion of her death \u2014 dated Oct. 11, 1811 : \u2014 \" Well hast thou left in life's best bloom The cup of woe for me to drain : If rest alone be in the tomb, I would not wish thee here again.\"] St. xcvi. In this st. the poet mourns the deaths of his mother, his friend Eddleston, and the mysterious \" Thyrza,\" all of whom died about the same time. \"Some curse hangs over me and mine,\" he wrote, before the death of the last. [Letter to Scrope Davies.] St. xcvii. This stanza, in the midst of real sorrow, reintroduces the Byronic attitude. He will riot and laugh to hide, if not to drown, his real feelings. Persons who are quite overcome by sorrow do not usually talk of it in this way. \" Other men can always take refuge in their families, etc. . . . \" (Letter dated Oct. 11). There is no doubt that Byron was very much alone at this time, and felt it very deeply, having little or no occupation and health already shaken. Eld. See previous note (II. 117). Byron notes that he concluded Canto II. at Smyrna, March 28, 1810. THIRD CANTO. \" I have just finished a 3rd Canto of Childe Harold, longer than either of the two former, and in some parts it may be better. \" \u2014 Letter to Murray, d. Ouchy, nr.

Feel our fiery horses Like proud seas under us.\" [Beaumont and Fletcher (Two Noble Kinsmen).]"], [223, "THIRD CANTO. 199 Byron may have borrowed the thought ; if he did he certainly improved it. The idea of his being like a piece of seaweed, torn from its root and drifting before wind and tide, is also a fine one, finely expressed. 1. 20, Youth's summer. Spring rather. He was still under 30. St. iv. Byron here pretends (St. iv.) that he does not think this canto equal to the preceding : but the letter quoted above (n. 1) shows that this was not his opinion in real fact. The two stanzas that follow (v., vi.) are of an egotistical character ; but the egotism of so marked a man was interesting. Scott speaks of their \" moral interest and poetic beauty.\" The poet's thought may be thus explained : \u2014 A man whose experience makes him old \u2014 no matter what his age \u2014 has seen so deeply into existence as not to be surprised at anything that may happen, nor can events cause him any fresh suffering ; for he knows the value of solitary reflection. The satisfaction of adding to our sense of life by originating new notions is now the poet's object ; and his sense of his own nothingness yields to the feeling that his thoughts are real. This idea may be compared to the proposition of the French philosopher, Descartes : \u2014 \" I reflect, therefore I am.\" It is the exercise of the thinking faculty that proves to man that he exists. St. vii. still displays egotism ; yet the sentiment of the latter half is manly : \u2014 He confesses that it is too late to cure the faults produced in his character by bad bringing-up. AVhatever change time may have worked in him, he has lost none of his moral courage. 1. 65, Something too much of this : a phrase that has become proverbial in the English language. [Hamlet, iii. 2. 69.] 1. 67, Long absent Harold. Childe Harold, or the poet in that character, has not been before the public for some time. The first and second cantos had appeared in February 1812, after which Byron had published other poems, in various styles, chiefly tales, somewhat in the manner of Scott's metrical romances. In April 1814 he recorded a resolution to write no more verse, of any kind whatever. 1. 73, Life's enchanted cup. Pleasure is here compared to champagne, a wine which is liveliest when first drunk. Harold, we are told, took his pleasure in haste, and found it bitter to the after-taste : a purer fount, alludes to his own marriage, which he goes on to lament as an invisible but unbreakable fetter for his limbs, which was heavy to bear and caused painful sores. 1. 74, He proceeds to relate how these troubles drove him to fresh wanderings. A journey to Brussels or Geneva was a more"], [224, "NOTES. 200 serious undertaking before the days of steamers, railways, and Cook's tickets. 1. 83, Yet, before leaving his country he had tried to amuse himself there. 1. 95, all grow old, i.e. grow entirely old : a Latin idiom. 1. 96, Fame untold, i.e. the clouds that hide the star. Until he found that his nature was too undisciplined to find solace in what is called \" Society,\" he preferred to \" breathe without mankind \" \u2014 i.e. to live a solitary life. So he said, and \u2014 perhaps \u2014 thought. For the next few years he was to show that it was not company from which he shrank so much as re straint. St. xiii. is a variation on the theme, so dear to poets, of the pleasures of scenery \u2014 what is known as \" Nature \" ; though there are, of course, aspects of the material world which are not pleasant for man. 1. 116, A mutual language . . . lake. A speech as clear to him as he to the powers of Nature ; clearer than an ordinary English book, such as he would often leave to look at the landscapes reflected in water. 1. 119, the Chaldean: an ancient people of this name, on the plains of the Euphrates and Tigris, were held to have discovered a rude science of astronomy. Byron says, he \u2014 or his hero \u2014 might have been happy if he could have confined his thoughts to the contemplation of the stars. 1. 123, But he had found himself recalled to human habitations which wore him and made him weary and ill-tempered ; and then, like a bird iu a cage, his spirit tried another upward flight. The hero is represented, in St. xvi., as setting out in a mingled mood of despair and a sort of wild recklessness, which the poet tries to explain, by comparing it with the practice ascribed to sailors whose vessel is about to founder ; who intoxicate themselves before they go down. The wild laugh of despair was capable of causing a passing elevation of spirit which he would not disturb. Then came his fit again, etc., in Macbeth, v. n. iii. 4. 21. 1. 146, Thy tread is on an Empire's dust. One of the poet's most justly-famous passages. Less than a twelvemonth had passed since the French Empire, established by Napoleon Bona parte, had been destroyed at the battle of Waterloo, a famous field near Brussels, the capital of Belgium. 1. 150, The poet thinks that such a field requires no monument. One, however, has since been erected. 1. 154, King-making : tlie restoration of King Louis XVIII. followed the fall of Napoleon.

The poet meditates on the faU of the French Emperor, and asks if it has done anything for the freedom of Europe. It was one of Byron's claims to distinction that he was among the first English aristocrats who denounced Privilege and sympathised with the cause of Freedom.

St. xx. The thoughts of the last are continued in this stanza. The truest glory seems to Byron to be in the death of tyrants. The tyrant of Athens, Hipparchus, was murdered by two patriots \u2014 Harmodius and Aristogeiton\u2014 at a pubhc festival whither they had brought weapons concealed in boughs of myrtle (514 B.C.). St. xxi. On the 15th of June the Duchess of Richmond, an EngUsh visitor, gave a baU, or dance-party, at Brussels, the capital of Belgium. The poet gives currency to the story that the British General was surprised at this gathering by the sound of the approaching artillery of the enemy. It appears, however, from the best accounts, that WeUington was well aware that Napoleon was then crossing the Belgian frontier, but desired that the festivity should go forward. The French were then at Charleroi, 35 miles south of Brussels, where their guns could hardly have been heard, even if they had any occasion to fire them. They had, in fact, a slight encounter there with the Prussian outposts under General Ziethen. St. xxii. By Wellington's orders the British Generals left the ball-room about 10 o'clock, and each proceeded to join his division on the road to Quatre Bras, a village on the way to Charleroi, whence the French were known to be advancing. The Duke himself stayed to supper ; and it is related, by one who was present, that he asked for a map of Belgium and, having looked at it attentively, pointed out Waterloo as the place where"], [226, "NOTES. 202 the decisive battle would be fought. He had a meeting with Blucher on the 16th, near Ligny, when the plan of concentration was arranged. __\u2022__. St. xxiii. The Duke of Brunswick, whose father had been killed at the battle of Jena, 1806, was in command of a detach ment of German cavalry who wore a black uniform. He fell at Quatre Bras, 16th June 1815. St. xxiv. The hurried departure of the officers for the held and their separation from their friends are described in St. xxiv. All knew that they might never meet again. This Byron tersely describes as sighs which might never be repeated. _ 1. 216, Mutual eyes : looks of reciprocated affection. Some of these pathetic feelings are portrayed in Thackeray's celebrated story, Vanity Fair. St. xxv. pursues the description, vividly representing the confusion of the march and the alarm of the Belgians\u2014 many of whom, however, sympathised with the French. 1. 227, The Camerons' gathering : a piece of Scottish music, so called from a famous clan of the Highlauds, whose chief was Laird of Lochiel. 1. 228, Albyn : an ancient name for northern Scotland. 1. 230, Pibroch : a tune of military character played on the bagpipe. 1. 235, Evan ; Donald : two famous chiefs of the Camerons, both of whom fought, in turn, against the English. 1. 236, Ardennes : should be \" Soignies \" : the Ardennes is a wild country 50 miles away.

St. xxviii. This stanza seems to confuse two famous fights. The battle of Quatre Bras was on the day following the ball, when Wellington encountered the French Marshal, Ney, losing 5200 men, but repulsing all attacks. In the evening, however, having heard of the defeat of the Prussians, by Napoleon, at Ligny, the Duke withdrew his army to Waterloo, where they halted all the 17th. Sir W. Scott\u2014 of whose admiration for Byron we have already seen specimens \u2014 thus characterises the above passage : \u2014 \" Though he shuns to celebrate the victory of Waterloo \" (Scott himself wrote a poem on the subject) \"he gives us here a most beautiful description of the evening which preceded the battle of Quatre Bras ... I am not sure that any verses in our language surpass, in vigour and feeling, this description.\" St. xxix. \" In the late battles, like all the world, I have lost"], [227, "THIRD CANTO. 203 a connection, poor Frederick Howard, the best of his race\" [Letter to Moore]. This young officer was the son of Byron's former guardian, the Earl of Carlisle, whom the poet had attacked in his famous Satire \"English Bards and Scotch Reviewers.\" He refers to this in 1. 257. St. xxx. is a lovely passage of true feeUng. Alajor Howard's grave was pointed out to Byron under two trees on the field of Waterloo. The exquisite couplet which concludes the stanza deserves especial notice. In St. xxxi. Byron expresses his sympathy with those who mourned the loss of relations killed at Waterloo : the British were abandoned by their Belgian allies, and attacked all day, from noon to past six in the evening, when the Prussian advance began to teU upon the French right. In these long hours Wellington lost 14,500 men \u2014 chiefly British \u2014 in killed and wounded. These, cries the poet, wiU wake no more at the summons of an earthly clarion. 1. 270, reckless : = indifferent : a powerful touch, contrasting the unhappy mourners with the unheeding denizens of ah above them. U. 279, 280, The honour that glorifies the dead is a cause of sorrow to the survivors. He seems here to fight with consolation, and will not be comforted for the loss of his friends. St. xxxii. returns to the survivors : their mourning ceases by slow degrees, but they will never again be what they were before their loss. 1. 289, Brokenly: an unusual locution which will be readily understood. Note the very artistic repetition of the word which develops into a simile in the next stanza. St. xxxiii. Lord Jeffrey in the Edinburgh Review dwelt with glowing admiration on this passage. 1. 294, Not forsakes : i.e. does not forget. Showing no visible sign. Such sorrows are silent. St. xxxiv. The thought is expanded in a manner charac teristic of Byron's reflective intellect. U. 299, 300, So long as we live our life gives birth to grief, as the root of a poisonous plant to its deadly branches. 1. 304, Apples. It was an old belief that the fruit produced by the trees on the shore of the \"Dead Sea\" \u2014 a bituminous lake in Palestine \u2014 were fair on the outside but had a pulp of ashes : they are said to be a kind of gall-nut. The years of man are so full of sorrowful hours that the poet thinks no one, fuUy reckoning the latter, would wish for sixty of the former. Threescore : an old fashioned phrase for sixty. Most persons, however, who reach this age are found willing to live a httle longer : suicide belongs to younger men."], [228, "NOTES. 204 1. 308, The Psalmist : in tbe Old Testament ; \"The days of man's life are threescore years and ten \"(Psalm xc. 10). 1. 310, Waterloo prevented many from attaining that limit : the recoUection of posterity is all that they have gained. St. xxxvi. contains one of Byron's many fine tributes of mingled praise and blame to Napoleon. In a passage of his diary, written in April 1814, after the Emperor's first fall, he thus expresses himself : \u2014 \" Out of town six days. On my return find my poor little pagod Napoleon pushed off his pedestal. It is his own fault . . . That Aluscovite winter wedged his arms ; ever since he has fought with his feet and teeth. These last may still leave their marks . . . he will yet play them a pass.\" Byron correctly judged the situation : Napoleon owed his first faU to the disastrous retreat from Aioscow in the winter of 1812 ; he fought in vain through 1813 and abdicated in the following year ; but he gave one more terrible \" pass \" to the European nations before the final crash of AVaterloo. The stanzas that foUow were translated to Eugene Beauharnais, the Emperor's stepson and favourite, in 1817 ; when the prince exclaimed that \"the delineation was correct\" [see Byron's note to Don Juan, Canto I. St. ii.]. 1. 318, Antithetically; contradictory qualities met in his char acter. 1. 321, Could Napoleon have steered a middle course between boundless ambition and vulgar objects he might have kept, or never obtained, the throne of France. 1. 326, Napoleon is here described as a prisoner of the world he had once subdued. 1. 332, A god unto thyself. Napoleon began to regard himself as omnipotent, and the helpless nations he conquered took a like view, while he prospered. But the battles of Leipsic disposed of his hold on Northern Europe (October 14-19, 1813). During the ensuing winter France was invaded by the Russians,Prussians, and Austrians at once. Napoleon endeavoured to fight them in detail, but they pushed past him, took Paris (March 3, 1814), and forced him to abdicate (April 11, id.). He was allowed to go to the island of Elba, but escaped in the following spring ; failed at Waterloo, and surrendered to the British. Confined in a more remote island this time, he lived at St Helena, in the Atlantic, till Alay 5, 1821, when he died of internal cancer. In Stanzas xxxvih. to xii. Byron testifies to Napoleon's con summate skill, but notes his want of judgment before the temptations of ambition. 1. 344, Byron notes the pride which made Napoleon bear his sorrows (as was thought) with dignity. It was bitter for his"], [229, "THIRD CANTO. 205 enemies to see him so self-possessed. Unhappily Napoleon did not always maintain this dignified attitude. But, in St. xl. and St. xii., Byron dwells on the point that such pride, however suitable to a fallen champion, was out of place in better days, [see Age of Bronze. Works, p. 526.] On St. xii. the poet records this note : \u2014 \" The great error of Napoleon was a continued obtrusion on mankind of his want of all community of feeling for or with them ; perhaps more offen sive to human vanity than the active cruelty of more trembling and suspicious tyranny.\" 1. 367, Philip's son. Alexander \" the Great,\" King of Alacedonia from 336 B.C. to 323, a mighty conqueror whom Byron would have had Napoleon resemble rather than Diogenes, a philosopher of the same period, who prided himself on showing contempt for all that men most desire and esteem. This sect was called \" the Cynic,\" from a Greek word meaning \" dog \" : as implying a snarling and inhuman temper. Byron attempts, in St. xlii., to account for the ultimate failure of Napoleon by saying that there are certain minds which flame up in a search of tasks of extreme difficulty, and are only conscious of fatigue when they have nothing to do. This, with the next two stanzas, seems to form one of those passages of met rical rhetoric which evaporates in the process of analysis. The foUowing may be taken as a general explanation : \u2014 Distinguished men in all paths of human effort have been mad, and have caused madness in others : if the machinery of their minds could be shown, we should cease either to envy them or wish to imitate their conduct. The habits that such men form in their existence of excitement are fatal to the repose which marks a calm old age. Thus they perish when deprived of the means of action ; like a torch from which oil is withheld, or a sword neglected and eaten by rust. 1. 393, Overcast with sorrow, etc. TwUight, to them, instead of being clear and calm, is clouded over : the metaphors are a little confused. St. 398 ff., Here Byron, according to his wont, pushes on his thoughts to an excess which has attracted criticism. Lord Jeffrey remarked on the fallacy of supposing, either that all the un scrupulous great had these feelings, or that the other greater men who were also good were always in the like unhappy predicament. 11. 407, 8, The meaning is :\u2014 The sphere of action for you, if you would be truly wise, must be either of your own wisdom's creation or of Nature's : and Harold\u2014 not having much wisdom \u2014 turns to Nature as displayed upon the Rhine. 11. 414, 5, The castles on the banks have lost their masters ;"], [230, "NOTES. 206 but seem to salute their memory from these shattered walls clothed in the leaves of ivy and other plants that grow on ruins. St. xlvi. The poet at last breaks off from his reflections on Napoleon ; saying that he at least will find a happier sphere in his own imaginations on the actual material world around him, of which the river Rhine is an example. This is one of the most famous rivers of Europe: coming down from the Swiss Alps it flows N.W. to Basle, then N.E. and N. through Germany, forming between Bingen and Bonn the special stream of German romance and patriotism. Its banks are clothed with vines, and studded with castle-crowned crags, about which legends linger. The ruins are described in St. xlvii. Crannying : penetrating the rifts of the masonry. 11. 421-3, Banners once floated over the towers, and battles were fought in the fields below them : but now the warriors lie buried where they fell and of their flags no shred remains ; all is dust ! In St. xlviii. Byron says that tbe Barons and Robber- Knights by whom those towers were built and inhabited were in character and conduct all that the greatest conquerors were, only that the scale of their operations was smaller. 1. 426, Power : = Powerful men, surrounded by strong cravings. 1. 430, \" What wants that knave that a king should have 1 \" was the question of a King of Scotland when he saw a leader of the border clan of Armstrong riding towards him with a well-equipped train of followers. 1. 434 ff., The subject is pursued in the next stanza. The Rhine-Knights fought and loved, bearing on their shields tokens of the ladies whom they loved, and winning or losing their castles in civil warfare. Although the habit of wearing iron corslets could not protect their hearts from the arrows of love, it made their passions and actions ferocious. 1. 441, Fair mischief: some lady caused disaster. 1. 443 ff., The poet apostrophises the Rhine, saying that its banks would be still more beautiful if man would not mar them ; and that to him, even as it is, the stream would be perfect could it but yield forgetfulness. 1. 451, Lethe : one of the rivers of the Greek mythology which the dead were believed to drink before entering the infernal regions, so that they might forget the cares of the life behind them. [v. Cant. I. St. lxxxii.] 11. 449, 50, Either Byron would wish to find in Rhine's waters oblivion of his own past sorrows, or perhaps forgetfulness of the way in which the sharp scythe of conflict had cut down the promise of Nature on its banks. 1. 452 ff., The next stanza is musical, but vague like aU music."], [231, "THIRD CANTO. 207 The meaning, generally, may be thus put : The waters of the Rhine bear no trace of the blood that has so often stained them for a moment ; but they cannot wash away the impression that all this carnage has made upon History. St. Iii. So the Childe thought, and yet took pleasure in the wooded nooks where the cheerful birds sang in the summer morning. 1. 465, Though on his brow . . . transient trace, recall Scott's description of tbe changeful cast of Byron's countenance quoted in Analysis (Canto III.). St. liii. perhaps refers to Miss Clairmont, a member of the poet Shelley's family, who was the mother of Byron's daughter AUegra, d. April 1822. Or the reference may be to his sister, to whom the song that follows is generally thought to have been addressed. Byron \u2014 for he is inextricably mixed with his hero by this time \u2014 was, like most great men, sincerely attached to children. His letters written in Italy \u2014 terminating with a short note to Shelley, d. April 23, 1822 \u2014 show consistent affection and care for AUegra. The allusion in St. Iv. has not been definitely explained by the commentators : it could hardly be to Aliss Clairmont (see concluding couplet). Perhaps it is imaginary : perhaps it only means his sister Mrs Leigh, to whom the poet was tenderly attached. 1. 497, The Castled Crag, etc. \" Drachenfels,\" or the Dragon's rock, is a peak of the Siebengebirge, on the right bank of the Rhine, 8 miles S.E. of Bonn, with the ruins of a castle on the summit. 1. 517, 1 send the lilies. Apparently suggested by Ben Jonson's famous Unes : \u2014 \" I sent thee late a rosy wreath, Not so much honouring thee As giving them a hope that there They would not withered be.\" Could thy dear eyes, etc. These lines are generally believed to have been addressed to the poet's sister. 1. 537, Coblentz, or Koblenz : called by the Romans Confluentes, because the Moselle here joins its waters to those of the Rhine, making a \" conference.\" 1. 542, Marceau : one of the most distinguished Generals of the French Revolution, shot in battle at Altekirchen in 1796. His body was interred at Coblentz, in the same grave as that where his colleague, Gen. Hoche, who died in Germany, was laid the following year. Marceau's remains were removed to Paris in 1889. The meaning of \"heroes \"in the plural, with \"enemy\""], [232, "208 NOTES. in the singular, is not very clear : if Hoche is included in the former the latter should have been \" enemies.\" Hoche was the officer charged with the:invasion of Ireland. Alarceau is held by historians to rank next after Hoche among the soldiers of the Revolution, not only for miUtary genius but for his pure and humane character at a time when such qualities were by no means universal. It was the respect thus inspired that led to his honourable interment by the Austrians. 11. 551, 2, Byron says that Alarceau was not content with the punitive part of war. 1. 555, Ehrenbreitstein. A fortified rock opposite Coblentz, with which it is connected by a bridge across the river. After the war of 1800-1801 it fell into the hands of the French and was demolished by blasting. The fortifications have been restored since the Germans have regained possession of the place. The iron shower : the cannonades to which it was often subjected in past wars. St.. lix.-lxii. The poet now leaves the Rhine to enter the mountains of Switzerland. 11. 568, 9, The vulture. Allusion to the bird which never ceased to torment the bound Prometheus, a Titan fabled to have been overthrown by Zeus for his acts of friendliness to Alan, and fastened to a peak in the chain of Caucasus. Wild but not rude ... to the year. The sober charms of the Rhine valley are in this passage compared to those of Autumn. 1. 572, Mellow : soft and ripe (Lat. rnollis). In St. Ix. Byron takes leave of the Rhine \u2014 or that portion of it above-mentioned \u2014 with the remark that the feelings it excites are not to be forgotten. [It is noted in Works, p. 34, on this stanza, that a body of Austrian troops, in the midst of an action near Alayence, were so struck with the first aspect of the river from a height they had just gained, that they stood still in admiration and suspended their advance, until the General rode up to see what was the matter.] In the next stanza the poet dwells for the last time on the assemblage of objects of interest here left : \" the precipice, the forest, the numerous Gothic churches and towns,\" with which this part of the Rhine abounds. 1. 591, The Alps. To reach the Swiss mountains so called Byron proceeded through the little canton of Freiburg, the home of the Helvetic race, to Geneva. The word \" Alp \" is very ancient, and has been connected by philologers with Albyn \u2014 the old name of the Scottish Highlands. They are the most extensive mountain system of Europe, standing on a base of 90,000 square miles, abounding in lakes and glaciers. Alont Blanc (15,800 feet) is their highest summit. They lie between the valley of"], [233, "THIRD CANTO. 209 the Rhone on the west, and that of the Po on the east ; and are thought to have been upheaved from those depressions. 1. 593, Snowy scalps. The bald tops of the Alps are covered by perpetual snow, from 8 to 9000 feet on tbe north, and rising to 10,000 feet high on the warmer declivities of Italy on the south. scalp = the top of the head, the word being akin to \"scale\" and \" shell.\" The avalanche (from a French verb avaler \" to descend,\" or go to the vaUey) is a mass of snow which rolls down the sides of the Alps when thaws occur in the lower levels of the \" snow-line.\" Whole viUages are thus swept away ; while to visitors on the mountains they are often peculiarly dangerous, as they come down without warning in the solitudes which adventurous climbers often invade. In the year 1887 no less than eight persons lost their lives above the snow-line. During the four months of his abode in Switzerland the poet made his head-quarters at the village of Coligny, where the Shelleys were also living. It is close to Geneva ; and the house occupied by Byron was called Campagna Diodati, after a cele brated Protestant pastor of the 17th cent, a.d., whose nephew Charles Diodati was a friend of the great poet Aldton, and ended his days in England. From this place Byron and Shelley made a tour of the lake ; and the former produced some of his best work while residing at Diodati. 1. 602, Morat, a village in the canton of Freiburg, between Neuchatel and the town of Berne, famous for the defeat of Charles the Rash, Duke of Burgundy, by the Swiss, June 22, 1476. At the time of Byron's visit the remains of a pyramid of human bones were still to be seen there ; and he records that he brought away enough of those relics \"to have made a quarter of a hero.\" L 607, The Stygian coast, refers to the ancient Greek fable that the spirits of unburied men were unable to cross the Styx (genitive Stygis) which was the boundary river of the other world. 1. 609, Cannae : modern, Canosa, in southern Italy, near the mouth of the river Ofanto (anc. Aufidus), where Hannibal defeated a Roman army far more numerous than his own in 216 B.C. 1. 610, Marathon : see above, p. 197 and Canto II. lxxxviii. Byron's political liberalism has been already mentioned (v. n. 19). He here contrasts such battles as Alorat with those fought for what he considers more selfish purposes ; but it is open to doubt whether the causes contended for at Cannae and Waterloo were less noble. Hannibal was struggling to save Carthage in his invasion of Italy : the English and Prussians were defending their respective countries against the incorrigible ambition of Bonaparte. O"], [234, "NOTES. 210 1. 613, Vice-entailed corruption, the cause of princes has dis honesty \"entailed,\" or settled on it. 1. 616, Draconic, alludes to the code of Draco, a Greek law giver, whose laws were said to be written in blood. St. lxv. refers to the story of Julia Alpinula, a young Helvetian priestess of Aventicum, the capital of her country, who died (after a vain attempt to save her father, condemned to death for resisting the Romans) at the age of 23. Her epitaph was supposed to be discovered some years before the poet's visit. Byron remarks that is the only remnant of the ancient city ; but the place still bears the old name in the slightly corrupted form of \"Avenche.\" The old man was executed by order of Aulus Caecina about 69 a.d. One column is all that remains to mark where the city stood (see Tacitus, Hist. i. 68). 1. 628, Julia : the young maid's epitaph is in Latin, and may be thus rendered : \u2014 \" Julia Alpinula, unhappy offspring of an unhappy sire, Priestess of the Aventian goddess, could not obtain by prayers the sparing of my father's life ; it was fated that he should die an evil death. I lived twenty-three years.\" \" These,\" notes Byron, \"are the names and actions that should not perish.\" [The epitaph is now known to be a modern forgery.] 11. 631, 2, Judges are bound by their oaths to resist the weeping of suitors, even when \u2014 as here \u2014 they sue for a father's life. In St. lxvii. the thought is carried on. The poet records, in a prose note, that impression ; and adds that he is writing the lines (June 3, 1816) with Alont Blanc shining upon him from a distance of sixty miles. The sight inspired the grand simile with which the stanza closes. 1. 645, Lake Leman : the \" Lake of Geneva.\" The distant mountains were reflected in the still water as the poet crossed it (July 20). 1. 649, cp. Too much of man here (see n. 12 to this canto). Byron excuses his desire for solitude in this passage ; adding that, as soon as he gets free from society his suppressed thoughts will break out again. 1. 658, We become the spoil . . . none are strong. The meaning of the passage is : \u2014 We are in a world of competition and strife ; from which we may endeavour to escape, not because we hate our fellow-men, but because we fear their contact, which may reduce us to their level of contentious weakness. It cannot be denied that the sentiment is somewhat morbid. It may be quite true that reserve is \" not discontent ; \" yet a shrinking from the duties of social intercourse is bad citizenship even where it is not misanthropic. 1. 663, There in a moment . . . Night, i.e. in an instant of"], [235, "THIRD CANTO. 211 error we may incur eternal repentance, and have nothing left but to weep and mourn. Bold men direct their course to goals they know and desire ; but such as he are unable to do so, aud never reach a haven. The metaphor is obvious : and Byron, no less than his brother poet, Shelley, with whom he had just begun to be intimate, was destined to furnish examples. He goes on in St. lxxi. to ask if it be not better, with such feelings, to live alone in some beautiful spot, admiring the scenery, and passing one's life away, the \" eternal child \" of Nature. He found, too late, that there was a nobler life than that. 11. 674, 5, The Rhone as it leaves the lake \u2014 here viewed as a nurse's breast \u2014 is swift and blue (see below, n. 881). St. lxxii. is a flight towards what is called \" Transcendental ism,\" where man is supposed to blend into the tissue of the Universe, feeling taking the place of experience ; with a vague Pantheism obliterating the prosaic conditions of common life. Such a system was well suited to the prismatic intellect of SheUey, but could hardly take permanent hold of a mind like Byron's, who was, at bottom, a man of the world. High moun tains are a feeling. Expresses the sentiment caused by Alpine scenery as contrasted with the din of the crowded town. In the next three stanzas the matter, already somewhat thin, is beaten threadbare. AVe seem to meet a mundane representation of what religious people call \" conversion ; \" the solitary com muning with Nature having bathed the soul aud sent it forth, equipped for a new and nobler career. 1. 699, The mind . . . worm. We are now in an element almost too subtle for expression : whether the poet looks forward to a dream, a trance, or death itself, he contemplates something like complete emancipation, in which he shall, at last, be united with abstract Beauty. 1. 708, The mountains ... as I of them : he blows the bubble almost to bursting here, and asks whether the material things about him may be a part of himself as much as he may be a part of those ? Should I not contemn . . . dare not glow ?

The Romans of old used to burn their deceased friends and collect their ashes in a vessel called an"], [236, "212 NOTES. \" urn \" : Byron did this, years after, to his present companion Shelley. 1. 720, To look on One. To think of J. J. Rousseau, a native of Geneva (d. 1778), with whose strange character Byron had a sym pathy due to some common features. Byron here seems to at tribute the troubles of Rousseau's life to a thirst for fame. Rous seau was the writer who both caused and largely influenced the movement which overthrew the old French monarchy. He believed, or affected to believe, that civilisation was the cause of all social evils. His fallacious teaching, enforced by a fasci nating eloquence, provided no discipline for the passions, but supplied them with specious texts and sonorous maxims. Hence he is here said to have thrown \" enchantment over passion.\" In June, Byron and Shelley left Geneva for a boat-voyage along the southern side of the Lake, which was in the kingdom of Sardinia. Between Evian and Aleillerie they encountered a storm, but reached tbe latter in safety, and studied the scene of Rousseau's celebrated tale The New Heloisa ; of which book Sir AV. Scott has noted that it made a \" deep impression upon the feelings of the poet.\" Scott was totally unable to share this ; but the book is generally allowed to merit the praise bestowed on it in this stanza by its idyllic eloquence and consummate descriptive power. St. lxxviii. In the next stanza we find praise of the work, extending to the author in a somewhat exaggerated spirit and style. For to be thus, etc., may be taken to mean that Rousseau's love had a tendency to ruin and waste him. Rousseau was a sincere and generous thinker ; but, as a man, was more remark able for self-indulgence than for pursuit of any high \" ideal beauty ; \" and his conduct has been usually palliated by tbe supposition that his mind was permanently disordered. In all this there was little in common with Byron, the high-born man of the world, with good judgment and a fairly strong will. Where Byron was most in sympathy with Rousseau was, perhaps, in the combination of contempt for civilised men with a readiness to seek their approval by unreserved revelations of self. 1. 744, Julie : the heroine of the romance referred to in the last note : her conduct will hardly seem either mild or sweet to calmer readers. Sir W. Scott professed scorn of Julie and her friend St Preux ; \" we can see little in the loves of these two tiresome pedants to interest our feelings for either of them.\" Burke called the book \"an unfashioned, indelicate, sour, gloomy, ferocious medley of pedantry and lewdness.\" In 11. 749, 50, the poet accepts the notion that the kiss of a female friend might every morniug cause an innocent glow in Rousseau or his hero."], [237, "THIRD CANTO. 213 St. lxxx. Rousseau's conduct towards those who endeavoured to befriend him is truly painted. 1. 757, But he was phrensied . . . reasoning show. That is to say, Rousseau's conduct was due to a sort of madness, the more dangerous because it never could be accurately discovered. His madness, says Byron, had all that logical quality which makes madness most dangerous. 1. 763, The Pythian's cave : the Delphic oracle in ancient Greece ; where a priestess called \" the Pythia\" inhaled a sort of intoxicating vapour and then uttered mysterious sayings which the people, high and low, accepted as oracles of the deity. 1. 764, Set the world in flame. The doctrines expressed in some of Rousseau's writings were as sparks to set fire to the com bustible elements, which had long been collecting in France. His works were in the French language, which is ordinarily used at Geneva. L 770, Too much wrath. Byron explains the crimes of the French Revolution by the excessive sense of danger, felt by the people and their leaders. [See Carlyle's dramatic and penetrat ing book on the subject.] The judgment of Byron on the Revolution has been justly praised for its sympathetic sobriety. St. lxxxiii. contains a wise and manly account of the terrible events of 1793 in Paris. 1.776, To rebuild, etc. In 1816 \u2014 when these lines were written \u2014 the self-willed ambition of Bonaparte had caused a temporary pause in the work of the Revolution ; and the Bourbon Alonarchy may have seemed permanently restored. After many vicissitudes a democratic system was founded in 1871, which has already lasted longer than most of its predecessors (1893). Byron's foresight is strongly shown in the expression \u2014 \" this will not endure nor be endured.\" 1. 785, They who . . . their prey : this is the best that can be said for the crimes of the Parisians. They had come to power without any previous political education. In St. lxxxiv. Byron veers round to one of his customary egotisms, and is more than usually mysterious and obscure. In one of his letters he compared himself to a beast of prey which, when baffled in its spring, retires in a sullen way to its lair. This, or some similar thought, was in his mind now. His hour was to come, though it was very brief. He was slower to punish than to forgive. St. lxxxv. Shelley described this excursion in a letter, dated July 12, 1816. Meillerie, he said, was \" enchanted ground, were Rousseau no magician.\" He adds : \u2014 \" The lake appears somewhat calmer as we left Aleillerie, sailing close to the banks,"], [238, "NOTES. 214 whose magnificence augmented with the turn of every pro montory.\" 1. 796, The alternative of punishing or forgiving will present itself, and the latter will be my choice. 1. 798, Contrasted lake: \"an awkward phrase, of which, how ever, the intention is not dubious.\" The lake's calm is a contrast to the wildness of Byron's world, which repeats the lesson dwelt on in Stanzas lxix. to lxxiii. 1. 802, This quiet sail : the poet must be supposed to be in a boat upon the lake. 1.803, Once I loved . . . so moved. This placid water rebukes the old liking tor the sea [but see below, conclusion of Canto IV.]. Sts. lxxxvi. to ix. In this lovely passage the charms of the calm are enhanced, as a skilful preparation for what is coming. Note the combination of the senses : sight, smell, and hearing all soothed and gratified at once. 1. 810, Jura. An elevated plateau of eastern France, of which the higher points are over 5000 feet in altitude. St. lxxxvii. The grasshopper is a small insect whose noise reminds the poet of a child making merriment by night. After notes of grasshopper and roosting bird comes silence, and the dew condensed by the radiation of the earth after sunset, when the stars appear. Dew, being only formed in calm and cloudless nights, has become a symbol of nocturnal repose. The imagined connection between the heavenly bodies and our earthly fates is the subject of St. lxxxviii., 'tis to be forgiven, etc. We may be pardoned if we allow our ambition to carry us in fancy to a fellowship with those heavenly bodies. 1. '833, Fortune, fame, power ... a star. Thus we speak of \" the star of our destiny,\" \" born under an evil star,\" and so forth : assigning to the stars the aggregate of those things which do not seem to be in our own control. St. lxxxix. works out the thought, and ends by tracing all beauty to its ultimate source. The next stanza is an attempt to expound the feeling of unity, or concord, which the poet recognises as binding the universe in a girdle of beauty. 1. 849, Cytherea ; a Greek name for the goddess of love. Every evening, during his stay at Diodati, the poet embarked upon the lake. In September he made another distant excursion, visiting Vevay and the Bernese Alps \u2014 or \" Oberland \" \u2014 in company with his former fellow-traveller, Air. J. C. Hobhouse. 1. 851, 'twould disarm, etc. The charm, or spell, of this celestial accord would deprive Death of his terrors, were there any reality about them."], [239, "THIRD CANTO. 215 1. 852, The early Persian. The inhabitants of ancient Persia were fire-worshippers, and\u2014 like the people of Canaan\u2014 loved to hold their orisons on mountain-tops. Byron observes, in a note appended to his collected Works (Note F. p. 768), that prayer and preaching in the open air are most effective, alike on ministers and on their congregations. Air Tozer, in his edition of the poem (Clarendon Press, 1890), refers to Herodotus (i. 131) \"Calling the whole circle of the sky Zeus, they go up to the highest peaks of the mountains to offer sacrifices to Him.\" So the old Roman poet, Ennius, speaks of looking at \"that high brightness which all invoke as Jove.\" [Compare Sansk. Dyaus, \" the shining one.\"] 1. 861, The sky is changed. On leaving Aieillerie the visitors encountered a still more violent storm, in which they were nearly wrecked, and which both Byron and Shelley described in letters to their friends. That must have been about the 26th June ; but the tempest described in Stt. xcii. to xcvii. must be placed some ten days earlier on the authority of Byron himself. He says :\u2014 \" the thunder-storm to which these lines refer occurred on the 13th June. I have seen among the mountains of Chiniari [see above, Canto II. mi. (50, 51)] several more terrific, but none more beautiful.\" IL 868, 9, This couplet is little more than a phrase of verbal music. Jura is a mountain chain of France, visible from Geneva. \" This,\" notes Sir AValter Scott, \" is one of the most beautiful passages of the poem. The fierce and far delight of a thunder- storm is described in verse almost as vivid as its lightnings . . . a picture of sublime terror, yet of enjoyment, often attempted but never so well brought out in poetry.\" 11. 871, 2, The poet says that in a night like this he would not go to bed. 1. 879, The swift Rhone. \" We passed from the blue waters of the lake over the stream of the Rhone, which is rapid even at a great distance from its confluence with the lake\" (Shelley, as above). 1. 881, Mining depths. The expression is hard to render in prose : the precipitous banks are regarded as descending to the deep bottom of the stream ; and so, the poet says, does hate, that parts two persons whose love has turned to hatred. The Rhone rises in the N.E. corner of the Valais, through which it flows until it enters the lake of Geneva, S. of Chillon. [Simile per- haps taken from Coleridge's Christabel.] At this point the water of the river is yellow and turbid. At the Geneva end of the lake a stream emerges which is considered a re-appearance of the same river, as blue and clear as stained glass."], [240, "NOTES. 216 St. xcv. In this and the next stanza storms are viewed as con crete and separate beings, leaping in flame from hill to hill. These storms are represented as mighty jugglers tossing about their balls of fire. 1. 901, Knoll : he means \" knell,\" the stroke of a hell. Byron here implies that the watchfulness of which he spoke at 1. 872, is by the storms' east voices. 1. 904, Ye : properly \"you\" ; ye is the nominative; but this somewhat ungraceful licence is not peculiar to Byrou, being found in some, though chiefly earlier, writers. 1. 906, Could I embody : if he could condense his whole mind and moral nature into one word he would fain do so, even were that word a flash or bolt. It must not be supposed that all these violences are genuine : yet we find Byron, in a letter to his sister of this date, employing language hardly less strong : \u2014 \"The recollection of bitterness, and more especially of recent home-desolation, has preyed upon me here ; and neither the music of the shepherd, the crashing of the avalanche, nor the torrent, the glacier, the forest, or the cloud have for one moment lightened the weight upon my heart, nor enabled me to lose my own wretched identity in the majesty, the power, and the glory around me.\" 1. 915, The morn. Here Byron recurs to the ancient personifica tion of the dawn as a \"rosy-fingered'' maiden, growing ever brighter till she turns into, or introduces, the full day, and calling upon men who had slept or watched all night to resume the pilgrimage of life. For his part, thc poet pursues his study of the scenes on the Lake of Geneva and its shores. U. 919, 20, The journey is pursued on the morning after the tempest. 1. 921, Leman : Lemanus is an old Latin name for this inland sea, which is 45 miles long and covers an area of 323 square miles. 1. 924, Clarens : a village 3^ miles S. of Vevay on the N.E. corner of the lake, with a small four-cornered castie, opposite to the rocks of Aleillerie, and \u2014 like them \u2014 described by Rousseau in The New Heloisa. The French writer particularly dwells upon the effect of sunset on the neighbouring heights ; \" whose red rays,\" he says, \" form on those white summits a lovely roseate hue which is seen from a great distance \" (Lett. 17, part 4, note). In his Confessions Rousseau says: \u2014 \"Visit these spots . . . and then say if nature has not made this fair land for a Julie and for a St Preux ; but you must not look for them there.\" \" It is a scene,\" so Byron notes, \" of the existence of love in its most extended and sublime capacity and of our participation of its good and of its glory. . .

Aluch of this may be classed as rhetoric and rhapsody ; yet the English language had seldom been made to sing so before. 1. 960, He who hath loved not . . . the more. From the Per vigilium Veneris, an old Latin poem. 1. 965, For 'tis his nature, etc. : love must either dwindle and perish, or must grow into an immortal benediction. 1. 971, The landscape, as viewed by Byron, was suited to the intercourse between such refined persons.

For the Alps see n. 62. 1. 977, A couch. This is a variation of the phrase \" the bed of the river.\" 1. 978, Lausanne. \" From A^evai we came to Ouchy, a village near Lausanne. . . . We visited Lausanne and saw Gibbon's house. We were shown the decayed summer-house where he finished his history, and the old acacias on the terrace from which he saw Mont Blanc after having written the last sentence \" (SheUey's Letter, quoted above). Lausanne, the capital of the Pays de Vaud, is on the N. of the lake, and the poets passed two days in the neighbourhood on their way back to Coligny. Here Byron wrote his poem, \" The Prisoner of Chillon.\" 1. 978, Ferney ; a village 4j miles N.AV. of the town of Geneva, once the residence of Voltaire. 1. 982, Gigantic minds. Allusion to the power with which Gibbon and Voltaire led attacks on the then universally received opinions of Christendom. The poet affects to compare them with the fabled Titans repulsed by Zeus when they laid siege to Olympus. These modern \" Titans,\" however, had no wish to take possession of the medieval Heaven, but rather to disprove its existence. 1. 987, The one . . . throne.

He was as ready to disturb tbe majesty of kings as to scathe the self esteem of a pedant. [The names of the chief subjects of these controversial passages are Alaupertuis, Larcher, Freron, etc.] 1. 996, The other. Gibbon has been justly esteemed for the research of his great work (Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire), conceived 1764, and not completed till 1788. It is also praised for the dignity of the style and its marvellous imagination. On the other hand, it has given abiding offence to conservative thinkers, not merely by its active depreciation of the origin and effects of the Christian creed, but still more by the total absence of that enthusiasm always professed for the heroism of its first supporters. 1. 1004, This line is a side-blow at those who would dispose of all doubts, that they cannot meet otherwise, by saying that the doubters will be eternally punished in the next life. 1. 1005, By them, if merited, the penalty is paid. That is : \u2014 Voltaire and Gibbon attacked orthodox opinions on their own responsibility. It is not the part of their weak fellow-men to sit in judgment upon their words and actions ; they will be judged in a far higher Tribunal. The poet returns to his favourite Nature in St. cix. In July he finished this canto : and passed August and September with Hobhouse, in the Alpine tour that furnished material for Manfred, and for the first moiety of Canto IV. of Childe Harold. In October he \"pierced\" the Alps, and entered Italy by the Simplon route and the Lago Alaggiore, the great water that divides Italy from Switzerland. 11. 1021, 2, A somewhat forced description of the Alpine region as one that seems to grow upward until earth embraces heaven. 1. 1025, The fierce Carthaginian : Hannibal (3), 247-183 B.C., a famous Carthaginian general, conquered the Romans in several battles, but was ultimately driven from Italy (see above p. 209, 1. 609, n. 7). Rome bequeathed to Europe almost all the materials of modern civilisation, an indirect but obvious conse quence of the Carthaginian failure. 11. 1026, 7, Alodern authors of Italy, such as Dante, Boccacio, Petrarch, Tasso, Ariosto, etc. 1. 1033 referstohis marriage-troubles whichdrovehim to wander.

We have to learn how"], [243, "THIRD CANTO. 219 to hide all the feelings which most deeply agitate our minds, and the lesson, though difficult, is finally conveyed. So he may have thought : but, in truth, Bfron learned this lesson less effectively than many far inferior men. Both his poems and his letters show a constant yearning for human sympathy, which he was willing to buy even at the price of the most intimate revelations. He affirms that he wrote this Canto for his own amusement and without any need of blame or praise. In Stt. cxii.-cxiv. the poet declares that he feels conscious of having offended pubhc opinion : but no matter, he has \" filed his mind '\u2014see Shakspere, Macbeth, iii. 1. (where, however, the word is only a contraction for \" defiled \"). U. 1053, 4, cried aloud . . . echo. Shouted to harmonise with a senseless sound. 1. 1058, To \"tile\" is to arrange in order, p.

In the last of the three stanzas he holds out a scanty' ohve branch, admitting the possibility of some isolated cases of honesty and true affection. Scott's simpler and less egotistic nature led him to remark on this passage that the surest way to peace lay in stooping \" to the realities of life.\" We ought to \" repent if .we have offended, and pardon if we have been trespassed against ; looking on the world less asa foe than as a capricious friend whose applause we ought \u2014as far as possible\u2014 to deserve, but neither to court nor to contemn.\" This Canto concludes with an apostrophe to the child mentioned in the opening (see n. 1). He means the Canto (\"thus much\") to be a special memorial for her whereby to remember her father, even should she never meet him in the body. 1. 1084, This was in my nature (see above, n. 54) : Byron's yearnings for his children were more than a passing impulse. His relations to the little AUegra showed that his complex character included the feelings of a fond parent. In St. cxvii. Byron assumes that his daughter wiU be brought up in a bad opinion of her father ; his very name employed in her hearing as an evU charm that has desolated her home and forfeited paternal rights. 1. 1092, An aim and an attainment.

[The Fourth Canto of Cliilde Harold was begun at Venice in June 1817. In the previous autumn the poet had left Switzer land, travelling with Mr Hobhouse through the Valais, over the Simplon Pass by the new road made by Napoleon, crossing the Lake Alaggiore, and passing a short time at Alilan and A'erona. The middle of November saw him established at Venice, where he remained till Alarch. During the spring he visited the northern parts of Italy, going as far as Rome ; and soon after his return to Venice he began this Canto. It was ready for press by the, end of the year, and was dedicated to Hobhouse, who was going to England and carried the AIS. to Alurray.] 1. 1, The Bridge of Sighs. The ducal palace is separated from the ancient state-prison of Venice by a canal crossed by a covered bridge hung in the air between the windows. Being covered it was used for the passage of persons secretly tried and condemned. At one time few \u2014 if any \u2014 could expect to return ; hence it became known as \"The Bridge of Sighs,\" as of farewells to life. 1. 3, Her structures . . . isles. Venice is built on an archi pelago of small islands. The Lion of S. Alark, which stands guard over the principal square, has wings ; and in the sur rounding buildings the government of conquered dependencies used to be carried on in the Republic's palmy days (see n. 14). 1. 10, A sea Cybele . . . powers. The city reminds him of a goddess rising from the sea. Cybele was a Phrygian goddess \u2014 not of the sea. 1. 14, Such she was . . . increased. The great power of the Venetian Republic was due to the commercial advantages which her position gave her in the Levant, or eastern part of the Alediterranean, and the consequent command of the overland trade with Asiatic countries. These advantages were diminished and finally destroyed by the opening of the Cape route, which proved both cheaper and safer, and was open to other nations."], [245, "FOURTH CANTO. 221 1. 19, Tasso : an Italian poet who died 1595 a.d. His great poem is called Jerusalem. Delivered, and is a legendary account of the first crusade. Some passages of its love-poetry were favourite recitations of the Italian people, though the poet learned to look upon these passages as the great sin of his life and a moral blemish of his work. 1. 20, Gondolier. The man who propels the \" gondola\" or boat of the canals. They have ceased their singing. 1. 24, Nature doth not die, etc. \" Beauty \" is here still, and our \" nature,\" or love of beauty, remembers what made A^enice what she was. The remainder of the stanza refers to the frivolity and dissipated life for which Venice was once so famous. 1. 26, The pleasant place. So Shakspere, describing the death of Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, says that at Venice he gave \u2014 \" His body to that pleasant country's earth.\" (Rich. II. iv. 1.) The passage is quoted in one of Byron's Letters. 1. 28, Unto us . . . ours is a trophy. Venice is for English people pecuUarly interesting from the part she has played in our literature. 1. 31, dogeless. The head of the Venetian state was called Doge. 1. 33, Rialto. The merchants used to frequent a bridge, so called, on the grand canal. The name originally applied to an elevated island to which the bridge led from the quarter of Saint Mark. 1. 33, Shylock : the \" Jew\" in Shakspere's Merchant of Venice. 1. 33, The Moor : Othello, hero of another of his plays. 1. 34, Pierre and Jaffier, characters in a piece by Otway (d. 1685), once a favourite on the London stage : it is caUed Venice Preserved. 1. 35, Of the arch. The Rialto is a bridge of one span ; and English readers are regarded as making these associations its central point, or \" Keystone.\" The meaning of St. v. will be best understood by making it carry out the preceding thought. Such characters as Shylock', etc., Byron thinks, are more beneficial to the mind than real human beings. Such imaginings are, for different reasons, the consolation of both ends of life. Perhaps, says the poet (who stood midway), even the poem I am now engaged on may owe its origin to some such feeling (compare Don Juan, XlV., x., \" In youth I wrote because my mind was full, And now because I find it growing dull.\") 11. 40 ff., What is forbidden by the conditions of human life is supplied by the creatures of the imagination.

He is, however, proud of being English born ; and \u2014 even if he never returns \u2014 he will not cease to love his native island, and will revisit England, in spirit, if he can. I connect, he says, the hope of being remembered as a poet with the English tongue ; or if that be too ambitious, and I be excluded from Westminster Abbey \u2014 why, then \u2014 let a better win the prize, and let me have no epitaph but that of Brasidas (that my country has many worthier sons). 1. 85, Spartan's epitaph : refers to the stern self-repressed cry of the mother of a Laced\u00e6monian general, killed in the hour of victory over the Athenians, 422 B.C. 1. 87, Meantime I seek no sympathy. These are fine sentiments, finely expressed. Byron had offended the conscience of England : he knows it, and is content to blame himself and bear the consequences. 1. 91, The spouseless Adriatic. The Doge, or elective Duke, of the Venetian Republic used to drop a wedding-ring into the sea in token of being her lord. It became a yearly ceremony, but ceased when the Republic was destroyed by virtue of the treaty of Campo Formio, and made over to Austria (1798). 1. 93, The Bucentaur : a state-barge so called from a monster in Greek mythology, half man half ox, which perhaps formed the figure-head of the original vessel : it was demolished by the French soldiers, and what Byron saw must have been some portions of it preserved in the Arsenal for the sake of their carving and gold. 1. 95, St Mark : the patron of Venice, whose winged lion is still to be seen on a pillar at the entrance to the Piazetta, or Square (see St. i.). It was here, but higher up towards the church gate, that the Emperor, mentioned in next stanza, knelt at the feet of Pope Alexander III. (1177). St. xii.

He, however, did not know German. For avalanche, see ciii., lxii. n. 1. 107, Dandolo. A Doge who led the storm of Constantinople \u2014 or Byzantium \u2014 in 1204, though totally blind and over 80. 1. 109, steeds of brass. Dandolo brought away four bronze horses ascribed to Lysippus, a Greek sculptor (flourished 330 B.C.). They were put up over the entrance to S. Alark's, taken to Paris by Napoleon, and restored to Venice after Waterloo. They are still to be seen over the door of S. Alark's Cathedral. 1. 11 1, Doria: a Genoese commander who, in 1379, threatened to bridle the horses. 1. 118, A new Tyre. A Ph\u0153nician seaport destroyed by Alex ander the Great (see I. xlv.). 1. 120, The Planter of the Lion. Byron's note explains this to mean the standard of S. Alark. Planta Leone, corrupted into Pantaleon, became a \" by word,\" or nickname, for a Venetian, and so for a comic character. See Shakspere : \u2014 \" lean and slippered pantaloon.\" [As You Like It, II. vii.] 1. 123, Ottomite : follower of Othman, Turk of \" The Ottoman Empire \" (more properly \" Osmanli \"). The word is used by Shakspere. 1. 124, Candia: capital of the island of Crete, besieged by the A'enetians for 24 years, and hence called here \" Troy's rival,\" though Troy only held out 10, according to legend. 1. 125, Lepanto. The ancient Naupaktos, where the Turkish fleet was defeated by a league of Christians in which Venice had a squadron of ships (see above IL, St. xl.). 1. 127, Statues of glass, i.e. fragile figures. 1. 129, Vast and sumptuous pile : the ducal palace. The emptiness and desolation of A7enice under Austrian rule are here described. In a letter written from Arenice about this time, Byron says : \u2014 \" The city is decaying daily, and does not gain in population.\" 1. 136, Syracuse. A city of Sicily where tbe Athenians were defeated, under their leader Nikias : the people spoke Greek, and released some of the captives because they recited verses of the Greek poet Euripides. \" Balaustion's Adventure,\" by Robert"], [248, "NOTES. 224 Browning, is a poem on this subject (see his collected Works, vol. vi.). In St. xvii. Byron argues \u2014 or suggests \u2014 that the habit of reciting passages from Tasso might have done a similar service to the Venetians ; or, at least, Great Britain \u2014 here called \" Albion \" \u2014 might have interposed to save a State which, like herself, had risen by commerce, to maintain supremacy. 1. 155, City of the heart. Compare St. lxxviii. \"O Rome, my country ! City of the soul.\" In line 156 the buildings seen arising out of the sea are com pared to water-spouts. 1. 158 refers to tbe plays mentioned in nn. 32-4, and also to The Mysteries of Udolpho, a novel by Ann Radcliffe ; and to Tlie Ghost Seer, a tale by the German poet J. C. F. Schiller, published 1784. 1. 161, Perchance . . . supply : \" she was.\" St. xix. 11. 1, 2. This unsatisfactory opening must be set down to the hurried way in which the poet habitually wrote. For not only are both meaning and construction obscure, but the running of one line into another is done in a manner offensive to the ear, and not sanctioned by the practice of any other good author. 1. 172, Tannen. Another instance of the employment of foreign words. Tannen are said in the original note to be a particular kind of tree that will grow on rocks. But the word is the common German name for \" fir-trees \" of any kind. Like the \" tannen, \" the mind of man may be able to grow by its own inward power ; its roots being struck in barrenness. We should take example by the patience of lower animals and learn to suffer in silence. 1. 189, Temper it : we may strengthen the \" clay \" of which we are made, to bear even as the camel and the wolf do who are less gifted than we.

That is, some minds, like boats after a storm, are newly equipped and made navigable for a fresh voyage. Others are worn-out till they break down ; minds of a third class seek to forget their troubles in religion, pleasure, well-doing, or wickedness, each according to his disposition. St. xxiii. Nevertheless, do what we may, the old ache that we thought cured is sure to come back and make itself felt from time to time. Note the pathetic lines which close the stanza. But \" wound \" is not a true rhyme to \" found.\" In St. xxiv. the poet takes up the idea of an \" electric chain \" : we cannot account for the shock that we have received."], [249, "FOURTH CANTO. 225 The concluding line means that he had made few friends, but had lost of that few too many. St. xxv. In April 1817 the poet left Venice on a tour through Northern Italy, returning at the end of Alay. These few weeks were enough time in which to reap the imperishable harvest of this Canto, which was begun on his return to Venice. 1. 221, Was the mightiest. Reference to the old days of Rome, once mistress of the civilised world: in its old command = in the times of its ancient power. 1. 223, master-mould. Aiould, or hollow, in which a master casts his designs. St. xxvi. is a passage of high feeling couched in faultless language. 1. 226, The commonwealth of kings applies to the Roman Republic, whose citizens were all associated \u2014 theoretically at least \u2014 in the government. Sts. xxvii., xxviii. contain an exquisite picture of the main land of the Venetian territory, painted in more detail than is our poet's custom. 1. 238, Friuli : the district at the head of the Gulf of Venice. 1 240, Iris of the West . . . past Eternity. It is evening on the Lombard plain : the western sky is full of blended liquid hues, like a rainbow in the place where the sinking day is disappearing. [So Gray sings of \" parting day.\"] 1. 242, Meek Dian : the moon, associated by some ancient poets with the goddess Diana. 1. 246, Sunny sea : the ocean -like expanse of heaven retains the reflection of sunset brightness, above the summit of the Rh\u00e6tian Alps, as if a temporary struggle were going on between the powers of light and of darkness. 1. 250, Brenta : a river which flows through the Venetian territory past Vicenza and Padua : here Byron had his summer home during his sojourn in the north of Italy. U. 252, 3, Glassed within it glows filled with the face of heaven. By this bold, if somewhat entangled metaphor, the poet pictures the evening glow as mirrored in the expanse of the river. But it fades and gives way to other and softer hues. 1. 259, Dies like the dolphin. Not the whale-like creature properly so called, but a bony fish of the mackerel family, known in the Aiediterranean as \" coryphene,\" which shows a series of metallic colours, especially noticed while it is dying after being caught. Also found in the Indian Ocean. 1. 262, Arqua: a little village in the Euganean Hills, 12 miles S.W. of Padua.

Byron's mind had been permanently clouded by his childhood's lessons in Scotland, with the terrible doctrine of \" Predestination \" ; he speaks here of the horror of believing that one is doomed to everlasting punishment. Such views were very general in the British islands at the time. 1. 307, Ferrara : chief town of an Italian province, formerly a Duchy under the family of Este, which however became extinct in 1598. 1. 314, Those who wore. The successors of Dante here con templated are Ariosto and Tasso. 1. 316, Tasso. In April Byron visited Ferrara, and was inspired by its associations to compose a poem entitled \" The Lament of Tasso.\" It is dated April 20, 1817, and Tasso is represented as mourning his fate in a madhouse. The subject of these lines had been attempting to escape from Ferrara, where he had become impatient of the ill-requited service he performed at the court of Alfonso d'Este, the Duke. At last he went to Rome (1575), but, being unable to carry out his purpose, became violently irritated ; and, after returning to Ferrara, used such wild, abusive language that he was pronounced insane and confined in the hospital of Sta. Anna, whence he was not released until July 1586."], [251, "FOURTH CANTO. 227 11. 330 ff., Byron apostrophises the Duke for ill-treating a man so far his superior in everything but rank and riches. 1. 334, Thou . . .

French verse appeared to Byron a thing to set the teeth on edge, with a certain note of metallic sameness. The praise of Tasso in St. xxxix. savours of extravagance. L 354. Bards. Dante and Ariosto. The first part of Dante's Divine Comedy is called L'Inferno, or \" Hell,\" and is a fanciful picture of the infernal regions and their inmates : the author is called \" Tuscan father,\" as being the first native author of dis tinction in Tuscany, of which Florence is the capital. 1. 359, Ariosto, to whom Byron compares Sir AV. Scott, wrote Orlando Furioso, a rhymed romance of the wars supposed to have been waged in the 9th century a.d. between the Spanish Muslims and the Franks. Dante's poem belongs to the 13th century, Ariosto's to the 15th and 16th. 1. 361, The lightning, etc. Hobhouse notes that the crown of laurels made of iron which had surrounded the head of Ariosto's bust at Ferrara, was melted by a stroke of lightning while it still surmounted the tomb in the Benedictine monastery of Ferrara. It was believed by the ancient Romans that no wreath of laurel would ever be struck by lightning ; but, of course, an imitation in iron would carry no such protection. But they also held that anything so struck became holy. St. xlii.

Sulpicius saw one set of ruins, Greek ; his own empire-city is now in a like condition, which I celebrate on my page as he did the other on bis. 1. 409, All that was of then destruction is. All that the Romans saw in ruin is ruined still. 1. 413, Skeleton.

Alars, the Roman war-god, took the place in later classical mythology of the Greek Ares, fabled to have been the lover of Aphrodite, the Greek Venus. 1.461, There full divinity. As purely spiritual beings the god and goddess could not put their passion into the prose of practice. 1. 463, The gods become, etc. The ancient gods, Byron some what fancifully says, found their divine nature too ethereal and subtle for the enjoyments of sense : so they took upon them human form. Alan, too, has his short periods of brightness, equal to those of the fabled Deities. But such soon pass, or are only recorded in the productions of the artist. 1. 470, Another satire on the critics. 1. 474, Vile breath ... to beam. Now that we have learned the real value of the \" Aledicean Venus,\" we can hardly relish this rather scornful language.

Overwrought expression to imply that \" the Aluse \" or inspiration of true artists requires no monument but such men's famous names. Here Byron confesses that he has but little taste for Art. See a letter of this period, in which he tells a friend : \u2014 \" I know nothing of painting ...

Here the Roman army, under the Consul Flaminius, was sur- rounded and destroyed by the Carthaginians under Hannibal, 218 B.C. Enclosed between the hills and the lake, with the passes blocked in front and rear, the Romans fought bravely for three hours ; and \" such was the animosity on both sides,\" says the Roman historian Livius, \"that an earthquake which partly destroyed many Italian cities, turned rapid streams, poured back rivers from the sea, and even tore down mountains, failed to be felt by any of them.\" Flaminius was killed and his army annihilated.

Orison (French, oraison) used for \" prayer \" by Shakspere and other poets. In St. lxix, the fall of the Velino is described, situated where the road from Spoleto begins to ascend the chain of the Appenine. This magnificent stanza is a fine specimen of what words can do towards painting a scene of external Nature. Note the climax : \u2014 \" the roar of waters,\" heard as you approach ; \" the fall of waters,\" seen as you draw near; \" the hell of waters,\" as you gaze and a moment ary wind removes the mist of spray that, like a curtain, hides the havoc and confusion of the mysterious gulf.

Sulla massacred indiscriminately that he might live a life of self indulgence. The English Protector was habitually merciful ; and his rare bloodshed \u2014 even if contrary to modern notions \u2014 is usually thought to have been prompted by conscientious motives [see Carlyle's work : Letters and Speeches of Cromwell]. 1. 762, Beneath his fate . . . destiny. A strange law seems to prevail through his fortunes. 1. 764, His day. Cromwell died Sept. 3, having won two battles on the same day of the month ; Dunbar 1650, Worcester 1651.

The figures of the children \u2014 believed to be of later date than the wolf \u2014 are meant for Romulus and Remus, founders of Rome, according to legend. Byron says ; \u2014 The bronze wolf may nurse her babes yet ; but the iron men, who were the real children of Rome, have passed away out of the world : and all those who have tried to imitate their conquering course are gone too, except Napoleon ; and he also is ruined. 1. 803, Being a man wholly inferior to the great Roman conqueror, C.

Napoleon \u2014 according to Byron \u2014 cared for conquest, and certainly knew how to obtain it ; but he cared for nothing else ; had no weakness but the thought of a self which he never properly consulted. As for his aims, one doubts if he himself had formally defined them. The character of Napoleon was one of perpetual interest to Byron, who \u2014 per haps \u2014 resembled him as closely as a well-born civilian could resemble a military continental parvenu. Beautiful, bold, able, and contemptuous of other men \u2014 such persons are not very likely to occur often in civilised society, or to prosper if they did. One may be stronger than others, but not stronger than all others together. In 811-16, Byron pursues the comparison between Julius C\u00e6sar and Napoleon ; dwelling on the vain and personal ambition of the latter. Byron goes on in St. xcii. to point out how little use it was to struggle with the world, where Death soon brings all to one common level. All but good men, he should have said : \u2014 \" Only the actions of the just Smell sweet, and blossom, in their dust.\" (Shirley, 1659.) 11. 821, 2, In a few years Napoleon might have been killed or died a natural death upon the throne."], [261, "FOURTH CANTO. 237 1. 828, Renew thy rainbow.

To understand this grand passage we must bear in mind that thunder-clouds are often brought up by a wind blowing in the direction opposite to the current of air prevailing on the ground.

Pursuing the subject, Byron extols \" love ; \" the second line of stanza cxxii. being lawless even to the verge of unintelligibility. \" The general meaning is, \u2014 the mind is infected with the longing for a beauty which only exists in itself ; and, by the action of this lever, conceives of perfect beings which cannot be found in real life \" (Tozer) : so of the ideal figures of the statuary, and the imagined persons we create on the basis of reality.

It is a disease, says the poet ; but the remedy is even worse : for it consists in stripping off the drapery with which our fancy had clothed the loved object, which \u2014 with a curious mixture of metaphors \u2014 is compared to a magic cord binding us and dragging us on ; also sowing the wind to reap the whirlwind, and encountering the failure of one who tries to be rich by making gold.

The latest examination (1891-2) has led to the conclusion that the porch is all that is left of the original temple, which was consumed by fire, and replaced by the present rotunda in the time of Hadrian, in the 2nd century a.d. Consecrated 610 a.d. it became a Christian church, under the name of \" Santa Alaria Rotonda.\" Hence the phrase, altars for their beads (a false rhyme to treads and spreads). The word beads alludes to the Uttle balls by which prayers are marked off on a rosary. 11. 1310, 11, Alan painfully pursues his path through the wild and prickly ways that lead him to the tomb.

The \" galaxy \" or \" milky way \" of astronomy was fabled by the ancient poets to be spilt from the breast of the great goddess Here. But here, the poet says, is a sweeter story. 1. 1360, The mole. The Castle of S. Angelo (Mole's Hadrianus), a vast circular pile, built for the mausoleum of the Emperor Hadrian, but converted into a fortress by BeUsarius, the famous Byzantine general, about 536 a.d. The contemptuous terms in which it is here mentioned arise, perhaps, from a notion that Hadrian \u2014 who had travelled in Egypt\u2014 desired that his monument should rival the Pyramids of that country. But the tomb was probably built by Hadrian's successor, as that prince himself was originally interred at Gaeta. 1. 1369, The dome. This and the next six stanzas, as Byron notes, are devoted to the Cathedral of Rome, the church of S. Peter, or \" the Vatican.\" It stands on the left bank of the river Tiber, which separates it and the castle from the rest of the city ; and occupies, together with the adjoining palace and museum, a place on the site of the gardens of the Emperor Nero, where the Christians were tortured and killed about 64 a.d. 1. 1370, Diana's marvel. The temple of the Greek goddess Artemis, at Ephesus in Asia Alinor, once esteemed one of \" the wonders of the world.\" It was 425 ft. long \u2014 about two-thirds the length of S.

The temple of the Jewish God Jehovah at Jerusalem, or \"Zion,\" was destroyed by the Roman general Titus, son of the Emperor Vespasian (whom he afterwards succeeded), in the year 70 a.d. 1. 1387, Its grandeur overwhelms thee not. This is an established fact ; even if not quite for the reason assigned in St. civ. It is probably due, in a great measure, to the absence of anything in the building to give scale.

A building that exhausted the resources of its builders during a period of 120 years should appear vast with out the necessity of study. With this reservation, however, Byron's description of S. Peter's will be always admitted to be a noble piece of metrical eloquence. The church is due to the successive designs of Bramante, Alichel Angelo, and Bernini ; and the provision of funds for it is regarded as one of the indirect causes of the \" Reforma tion.\" St. clix. The poet concludes his fine description by reminding us that mere admiration is not the only attitude of the mind ap propriate to the mighty fabric, for it teaches us the golden lesson of true greatness and the resources of human genius. St. clx. Laocoon was a Trojan priest destroyed, with his two sons, by serpents sent for the purpose by the angry gods who sym pathised with the Greeks in the Trojan war. The story is re presented by a famous group of sculpture in the Vatican, which was dug up on the Esquiline in the year 1506, and has been the theme of general admiration ever since. The composition is pyramidal, and may be called an apotheosis of physical and men tal suffering ; the boys being almost crushed, while their father still exerts his strength to strangle the serpents or make them re lax their grasp. It forms the subject of a celebrated work by the German critic G. E. Lessing, published in 1766 a.d., and more than once translated into English. The group is ascribed, by Pliny, a writer of the Emperor Trajan, to three Greek artists, and is believed to be of the first century B.C. 1. 1441, the Lord . . . bow.

[Compare Hamlet, III. i. 76, \" who would fardels bear I \" The word is from French fardeau, \" a burden.\"] 1. 1495, The poet turns abruptly to the death of the Princess Charlotte of Wales, daughter of the Prince Regent (afterwards King George IV.), which occurred November 6, 1817, while this canto was being written. \" It has been a shock, even at Venice,\" wrote Byron in a letter of the time, \" and must have been an earth- quake in London ...

From the heights above are visible the \" Campagna \" or plain through which the Tiber winds, and the sea on the shore of which Virgil places the scenes of the war in the Aeneid, his famous epic poem ; of which the opening is \" Arms and the man I sing.\" 11. 1563 ff., On the right hand, as you look towards Rome, is Tusculum, where Cicero had his country-seat, Tully reposed ; and on the farther hills, Digentia and the site of Horace's Villa.

But before taking leave of the Childe, the poet represents him as looking towards the Alediterranean, \"the mid land ocean,\" from the top of the Hill above Albano : \" that ocean which he and I once crossed in the war-ships that carried me from Gibraltar to the Bosphorus, where are the Symplegades, or as he has sung elsewhere, the islands called Clashers.

Any attempt at comment would be worse than superfluous : there is nothing like it : and we feel that no other language would have given due expression to the sense. The grand word \" thunderstrike \" is coined for the purpose of this passage. 1. 1624, Leviathans; \" a sea monster.\" The Hebrew poet called \" Psalmist \" has compared ships to such creatures (Ps. civ. 26). 1. 1629, Armada. The fleet collected by King Philip of Spain for the invasion of England was known as \"Invincible Armada,\" but was entirely destroyed by the English sailors and the tempests, 1588 a.d. 1. 1629, Trafalgar. (See above, II. St. xl.) Between Cadiz and Gibraltar, where the combined fleets of Spain and France were defeated by the British under Nelson, Oct. 21, 1805. Twenty ships were taken, but were almost all destroyed by a gale next evening. 1. 1631, Assyria, etc. These powers or \"empires\" were en- umerated as owing their temporary greatness to the sea. The 3rd line of this stanza was originally \" Thy waters wasted them.\" 1. 1639, Almost too strong. The idea of a mirror is opposed to that of a tempest. The poet means that which the Psalmist did when he said : \u2014 \" They that go down to the sea in ships . . . see the works of the Lord and his wonders on the deep,\" etc. (Ps. cvii. 23-5). The construction of this stanza is de fective, but the music noble. Byron alludes to his love of swimming in St. clxxxix. 1.1656, As I do here. He has forgotten that he was regard ing the sea from the Alban mount (above, St. clxxv.), which is about 3000 feet above the level of the sea. 11. 1663 ff., One can find no ground for this complaint of diminished power ; on the contrary, the whole passage is a climax marking the highest line of attainment that Byron ever reached \u2014 before or after."], [274, "250 NOTES. 1. 1671.

Sandal-shoon (old plural for 'i shoes\") and scallop-shell are symbols of pilgrimage employed in early times of European civilization.
