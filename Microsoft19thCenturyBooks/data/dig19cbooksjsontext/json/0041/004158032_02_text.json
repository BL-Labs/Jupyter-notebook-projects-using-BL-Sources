To this the Editor of Hughes' poems replies that the play was written originally on this plan, but that when it was offered to the Managers of D. L. in 1718, they refused to act it, unless the author would alter the character of Phocyas; pretending that the audience would not bear the sight of him, after he had changed his religion, &c\u2014 Hughes (who was then in a weak state) finding that if he did not"], [21, "d.l. 1719-1720. 11 comply, his relations would probably lose the benefit of his play, consented with reluctance to new model the character of Phocyas.

Of the MASTER of the REVELS. Chalmers in his Apology for the Believers in the Shakspeare-Papers, has a chapter on the Master of the Revels \u2014 he says \u2014 \" if we look into the King's \" household of early times, for the superintendant \" of the royal pastimes, we shall see an officer of \" high dignity and extensive power, who was called, \" in all formal proceedings, Camerarius Hospitii, and \" is named in the act of precedency the King's \" Chamberlain \u2014 this great officer, who is called in \" modern times the Lord Chamberlain, had the su- \" perintendence andgovernment of the King's hunting \" and revels, of the comedians, musicians, and other \" royal servants, appointed either for use or recrea \" tion ; he was of course by the original constitution \" of his office the real Master of the Revels, the"], [34, "24 OF THE MASTER OF THE REVELS. \" great director of the sports of the court by night, \" as well as of the sports of the field by day\u2014 \" the office of Master of the Revels was created in \" 1546\u2014 he had a salary of \u00a310 per ann \u2014 the \" Yeoman of the Revels had \u00a39 : 2s. : 6d.\u2014 eight \" Players of Interludes had each of them \u00a33 : 6s. : 8d.\" \" Sir Henry Herbert was appointed Master of the \" Revels by Charles the 1st ; he exercised unbounded \" authority over the drama till the civil wars, when, \" with the suppression of the stage, his authority \" ceased \u2014 at the Restoration he resumed his former \" jurisdiction, but found that the recent times had \" given men new habits of reasoning, notions of \" privilege and propensities to resistance \u2014 he applied \" to the courts of justice for redress; but the verdicts \" of juries were contradictory; he appealed to the \" ruler of the state, but without receiving redress or \" exciting sympathy \u2014 like other disputed jurisdictions \" the authority of the Master of the Revels continued \" to be oppressive, till the Revolution taught new \" lessons to all parties.\" Gifford in a note to the Alchemist p. 34 says \u2014 \" the Masters of the Revels were tasteless and \" officious tyrants, who acted with little discrimina \" tion, and were always more ready to prove their \" authority than their judgment \u2014 the most hateful \" of them was Sir Henry Herbert.\" Thomas Killegrew, the Patentee of the King's Company, succeeded Sir Henry Herbert as Master of the Revels in 1673 \u2014 he died in March 1682-3, and was succeeded as Master of the Revels by Charles Killegrew, who continued in office till Jan. 1724-5. (Chalmers.)"], [35, "25 OF THE MASTER OF THE REVELS. To this man did Cibber, when he had finished his Richard the 3d, apply for a license \u2014 Killegrew ex punged the whole first act, without sparing a line of it \u2014 he alleged that the distresses of Henry 6th would put people too much in mind of King James. There is no part of Cibber's Apology less excep tionable than this, in which he merely repeats the objection of the Licenser ; yet Chalmers, in a note p. 535, after quoting it, observes with a sneer \u2014 \" well might Pope cry out, modest Cibber.\" In 1714-1715, Steele and his associates in the Patent considered themselves as sole judges of the plays proper to be acted in their theatre \u2014 but on their acting a new play, the Master of the Revels demanded his usual fee of forty shillings, tho' they had spared him the trouble of perusing it; this occa sioned Cibber to be deputed to him, to inquire into the right of his demand, and to settle the matter amicably \u2014 Cibber, who in 1700 had smarted se verely under the insolence of office, was not sorry to undertake the business; he told the Master of the Revels, that he came not to defend even their own right in prejudice to his; that if their Patent had inadvertently superseded the grant of any former Patent or Warrant, whereon he might ground his pretensions, they would not insist upon their broad seal, but would readily answer his demands upon sight of such his warrant, any thing in their Patent to the contrary notwithstanding ; this Cibber thought he could not do, and when he found Killegrew made no direct reply to his question, he repeated it with greater civilities and offers of compliance, till he was"], [36, "26 OF THE MASTER OF THE REVELS. forced in the end to conclude with telling him, thai as his pretensions were not backed with any visible instrument of right, and as his strongest plea was custom, they could not so far extend their complai sance, as to continue his fees upon so slender a claim to them \u2014 and from that time neither their plays or his fees, gave either party any farther trouble. (Cibber.) Chalmers observes, \" It is amusing to hear, how \" this flippant negotiator explained his own preten \" sions and attempted to invalidate the right of his \"opponent; as isa subsequent charter, under the \" great seal, could supersede a preceding grant under \" the same authority : Charles Killegrew, who was \" now 65 years of age, seems to have been oppressed \" with the insolent civility of Colley Cibber.\" Chalmers may possibly be right as to the point of law, yet it would have been a satisfaction to com mon readers, if he had favoured us with that parti cular clause in Killegrew's grant, which gave him an exclusive and irrevocable right to prohibit any 2-lay from being acted without his license \u2014 if Charles Kil legrew really possessed a paramount legal authority from which even the Crown could not emancipate the Patentees of D. L., his behaviour towards Cibber in 1714-1715 was as pusillanimous, as it had been dictatorial in 1700 \u2014 Cibber's conduct on this occa sion does him great credit, and is very far from meriting the sarcasm bestowed on it by Chalmers. As Chalmers is so much inclined to censure Cibber, it would have been but fair in him to have pointed out distinctly what Killegrew's right was, and what, legal redress he would probably have met"], [37, "OF THE MASTER OF THE REVELS. 27 with in a court of law, if he had brought an action against the Patentees of D. L. for acting a play with out his license and for refusing to pay him his accus tomed fee\u2014 unless Killegrew's claim was clearly legal Cibber could not possibly have been guilty of inso lent civility, in declining to comply with it. Tho' Steele and his associates carried their point against the Master of the Revels, yet it must be con fessed that the clause in the Patent on which they founded their exemption is not worded so much in their favour as might be wished \u2014 indeed it does not differ materially from a similar clause in Davenant's Patent. A question naturally arises, how did Rich act on this occasion ? We should have been obliged to Chalmers if he had given us some information on this point \u2014 but he seems not to have paid this part of his subject the attention which it deserved \u2014 he only says in a vague manner, that the Master of the Revels, after Cibber's polite altercation with him, reviewed no more plays. In 1725, Charles Henry Lee succeeded Killegrew as Master of the Revels : during 19 years he exer cised such authority as was not opposed, and received such fees as were willingly paid. By the Licensing Act the power which the Lord Chamberlain possessed before the appointment of the Master of the Revels was restored to him \u2014 the act neither noticed nor alluded to the Master of the Revels, any more than if he had not existed \u2014 such was the early origin, the irregular progress and ob scure demise of the Master of the Revels!

Chalmers gives a circumstantial account of all the persons, who successively held the invidious office of Master of the Revels \u2014 his account would have been vastly more interesting, if he had distinctly pointed out the limits of that authority, which the Masters of the Revels and the Lord Chamberlains had over players and plays, according to law \u2014 a statement of the more flagrant instances in which they had ex ceeded those limits, would have been a most valu able addition to the information, which he has given us.

L. and the house seems to have been shut but 3 days. A certain Earl, who was said to have been in a state of drunkenness for about 6 years, being behind the scenes at the close of a Comedy, and seeing one of his companions on the other side, crossed over the stage among the performers, and was accordingly hissed by the audience \u2014 Victor was standing by Rich"], [68, "l. i. f. 1720-1721. 58 on the side that this Nobleman came over to; and on the uproar in the house at such an irregularity, the Manager said \" I hope your Lordship will not take \" it ill, if I give orders to the stage-door-keeper not \" to admit you any more\" \u2014 on his saying that, the Earl gave Rich a slap in the face, which Rich with proper spirit returned\u2014 on this his Lordship's drunken companions collected themselves directly and Rich was to be put to death \u2014 but Quin, Ryan, Walker &c. stood forth in defence of the Manager, and a grand scuffle ensued, by which the Gentlemen were all driven out by the stage-door into the street \u2014 they then sallied into the Boxes with their swords drawn, and broke the sconces, cut the hangings (which were gilt leather finely painted) and continued the riot there, 'till Quin came round with a Constable and Watch men; who took them all into custody and carried them before a Magistrate, by whom they were bound over to answer the consequences \u2014 but they were soon per suaded by their wiser friends to make up the matter, and the Manager got ample redress \u2014 the theatre was shut for about 7 or 8 days\u2014 the King being informed of the whole affair was highly offended, and ordered a Guard to attend this theatre as well as the other ; which was not the case before. Cibber, in the dedication of the Lady's last Stake, speaks of those gentlemen who thrust themselves forward on the stage before a crowded audience, as if they resolved to play themselves and save the actors the trouble and in his Apology he tells us, that in many a laboured scene of the warmest humour and of the most affecting passion, he had seen the best performers disconcerted by those idle gentlemen,"], [69, "l. i. f. 1720-1721. 59 who were more desirous to come in for their share of the attention of the audience, than capable of any pleasure from the play ; and who daily took their stands, where they might best elbow the actor, and interrupt him by their conversation : the inconveni ence and plague of which custom was so intolerable, that he and his brother managers were forced to get rid of it, at the hazard of their lives \u2014 and their only expedient was by refusing money from all persons without distinction at the stage door, by which means they preserved to themselves the right and liberty of choosing their own company there : and by a strict observance of this order they brought what had been before debased into the licenses of a lobby into the decencies of a drawing-room.

Act 3d consists of the scene at C\u00e6sar's palace"], [100, "90 JULIUS C\u00c6SAR. badly altered\u2014 Calphurnia is omitted, and two Priests relate the ill omens that have happened. Act 4th consists of the Senate scene considerably altered for the worse. Act 5th is the scene in the Forum\u2014 Brutus' ad dress to the Citizens is turned into blank verse with additions \u2014 one line deserves to be quoted \u2014 \u25a0 \" And when a grieving parent whips his child.\" \u2014 Then follows the remainder of the scene not ma terially altered \u2014 with this the play ends. Marcus Brutus \u2014 His Grace having but 2 acts of the original play to spin out into 5, was obliged to intro duce some new characters \u2014 thus we have Junia wife to Cassius and sister to Brutus \u2014 Dolabella \u2014 Varius a young Roman studying at Athens, &c. The first three acts are entirely the Duke's \u2014 in the first Dolabella is most absurdly introduced with a message from Antony to Brutus, requesting him to take the sovereign power on himself \u2014 in the 3d act Junia says \u2014 \"But Rome's at stake \" \u2014 To which Varius replies \u2014 \" And well it would be lost, \" For staying here one night within these arms.\" Cassius is almost of the same opinion. The substance of the 4th and 5th Acts is taken from Shakspeare, but the words are the Duke's\u2014the quarrelling scene is not badly written, but it is vastly inferiour to the original \u2014 Cassius says \u2014 \" From a superiour my Stars defend me!\""], [101, "91 JULIUS C\u00c6SAR. This is quite wrong, as Cassius was an Epicurean and did not believe in planetary influence. After Cassius has stabbed himself, Brutus comes on before Cassius dies\u2014 C\u00e6sar's Ghost appears to Brutus at the close of the 3d act, and again just as he is going to kill himself. Brutus some few hours before his death looked up to heaven and quoted a line from the Medea of Euripides \u2014 \" O Jupiter forget not who is the author of these \" wrongs.\" Shakspeare met with this'circumstance in Plutarch, but did not insert it in his play, which is a pity. Both the Duke's plays have a Chorus at the end of each act \u2014 those at the end of the 1st and 2d acts of Marcus Brutus were written by Pope at the command of his Grace \u2014 in Marcus Brutus the scene lies at Athens in the first three acts, and near Philippi in the last two \u2014 for this violation of the unity of place his Grace apologizes in the Prologue, but to satisfy us that he has preserved the unity of time, we are studiously informed that the play begins the day be fore the battle of Philippi and ends with it \u2014 conse quently Brutus and Cassius with their attendants must have gone from Athens to Philippi in one day \u2014 this absurdity is rendered the more glaring as Cassius in act 2d says \u2014 \" I must immediately haste to our friends \" Who all assembled in the fields of Sardis \" Wait there for me and Brutus.\" In the next scene Junia says that her husband is"], [102, "92 JULIUS C\u00c6SAR. gone to Sardis\u2014 however he rides post, and arrives at Philippi considerably within the 24 hours\u2014 into such disgraceful inconsistencies does the Duke fall from the silly affectation of appearing to preserve the unity of time. In fact Brutus and Cassius met at Sardis \u2014 from thence, and not from Athens, they went to Philippi \u2014 their meeting was after a considerable interval, and several grounds of mutual complaint had occurred \u2014 but in the Duke's play, they had only been parted some few hours, nor had any cause for an angry ex postulation taken place. The Duke's plays are on the whole a very bad alteration of Julius C\u00e6sar, but it would be doing him great injustice not to allow that his additions are very superiour to the stuff sometimes mixed up with Shakspeare's plays \u2014 he has many good sentiments well expressed \u2014 for instance \u2014 \" From whence ever came \" Good sense or learning, arts of peace or war? \" Deepness of thought, or nobleness of nature ? \" Except where liberty enlarged the mind ? \" Shakspeare and the Duke of Buckingham have both drawn the character of Cassius according to history, but he has been frequently misrepresented as killing C\u00e6sar more from personal pique than a love of liberty ; even Dr. Warburton insinuates as much in one of his notes \u2014 Plutarch tells us that Cassius when he was a lad licked Faustus, the son of Sylla the Dictator, for magnifying his father's power over the Roman people \u2014 Faustus' tutors wanted to have Cassius punished for this \u2014 Pompey hearing of"], [103, "93 JULIUS C\u00c6SAH. it sent for the two boys \u2014 when Cassius said, \" now \" Faustus repeat what you said before, and I will \" give you another licking.\" Plutarch says of Brutus that such was his virtue that he was a favourite of the generality of men, ad mired by the best of them, beloved by his friends and not hated even by his enemies. The Duke speaks of him as \u2014 \" A man sublimely wise, exactly just.\" But in the tag at the conclusion he partially con demns him \u2014 \" Yet the just Gods a righteous judgment send, \" He lov'd his country, but he killed his friend.\" Suetonius speaking of C\u00e6sar's death says he was \" jure c\u00e6sus\" \u2014 justly killed \u2014 and Cicero in his 2d Phillipic \u2014 \" Etenim omnes boni, quantum in ipsis \" suit, C\u0153sai-em occiderunt : aliis consilium, aliis ani \" mus, occasio defuit ; voluntas nemini.\" This appears to have been the general sense of the best, the wisest, and most disinterested persons in Rome, at the time when the fact was committed. C\u00e6sar's kindness in giving Brutus &c. their lives, was only the kindness of a robber, who had first done them the greater wrong by usurping the power to take them \u2014 this is Dr. Middleton's opinion, whose life of Cicero ought to be read by every person who wishes to get a good idea of Roman politics at that time. __. urroXoiTa Kcct ctXXog, ortg toixvtx yt t>e\u00a3oi.

In 1753 Aaron Hill published his Roman Revenge, a Tragedy written on the death of Julius C\u00e6sar\u2014 it had been acted at Bath\u2014 it has some good lines in it, but on the whole it is superlatively dull\u2014 Hill has grossly misrepresented the characters of C\u00e6sar \u2014 Brutus \u2014 Cassius and Servilia \u2014 he makes Calphurnia and Portia sworn friends from their childhood \u2014 but the greatest absurdity of all is, that he introduces Trinovantius, a British Tribune, who styles himself C\u00e6sar's old Soldier, proposes to protect him from the Senate by his Britons, and afterwards threatens to avenge his death, and guard Britannia's liberty \u2014 which no one but his friend C\u00e6sar had at that time ever attacked \u2014 C\u00e6sar on his part politely tells him \u2014 \" I thought the sons of Thames had felt no fears.\" Hill's object in writing this play was evidently to set C\u00e6sar's character in the fairest point of view \u2014 he says of him in the Prologue \u2014 \" And C\u00e6sar had a soul without one stain.\" It seems then that C\u00e6sar's wars in Gaul \u2014 his inva sion of Britain \u2014 his overturning of the fundamental laws of his country \u2014 his complaisance to Nicomedes, &c. \u2014 are no stains.

We are not to imagine, as it is commonly believed, that the violences which followed C\u00e6sar's funeral were owing to the general indignation of the Citizens against the murderers of C\u00e6sar, excited either by the spectacle of his body or the eloquence of Antony ; for it is certain that C\u00e6sar, through his whole reign, could never draw from the people any public signifi cation of their favour, but on the contrary was conti nually mortified by the demonstrations of their hatred and disaffection to him\u2014 what happened at the fune ral was the effect of artifice and faction \u2014 Cicero calls it a conspiracy of C\u00e6sar's freedmen.

Dr. Johnson some few pages before had said, that the condition of an actor makes almost every man, for whatever reason, contemptuous, insolent, petulant, selfish and brutal \u2014 this grossly illi beral observation reflects much more disgrace on Dr. Johnson himself than on the actors.

Dr. Johnson says \u2014 \" Savage had taken a resolution \" to write a second tragedy upon the story of Sir \" Thomas Overbury, in which he preserved a few \" lines of his former play, but made a total alteration \" of the plan, added new incidents, and introduced \" new characters ; so that it was a new tragedy, not \" a revival of the former \" \u2014 this passage does Dr. Johnson great discredit \u2014 that Savage revised his play seems perfectly true, every other assertion which Dr."], [119, "d. l. 1722-1723. 109 Johnson has here made, is a gross misrepresentation of the real fact \u2014 Sir Thomas Overbury as printed in Savage's works in 1775 differs but little or nothing from the edition of 1724 \u2014 it was brought out at C.

Ram Alley, or Merry Tricks is a good C. by Lodo wick Barry \u2014 it was printed in 1611, and had been acted by the children of the King's Revels\u2014 Ram Alley is situated near the Temple, and seems to have been part of Alsatia (see Squire of Alsatia T. R. 1688) \u2014 William Smallshanks is a wild young man, who had mortgaged his small estate to a lawyer called Throate \u2014 with the assistance of his friend Boutcher, he pretends to have run away with the daughter of Lady Sommerfield, who is a rich heiress \u2014 he brings his Courtezan to Throate's as the heiress \u2014 Throate prevails on her to marry him instead of Small-shanks, but in order to compound the matter he restores to Small-shanks his mortgage \u2014 Constantia, the real heiress, is in love with Boutcher and follows him as his Page \u2014 at the conclusion, they are married\u2014 \u2014 Taffata, a mercer's widow, agrees to marry Sir Oliver Small-shanks\u2014 on the night before the wedding, Wil liam Small-shanks convices her that a young husband would suit her better than an old one \u2014 Sir Oliver. comes to her house with a serenade of fiddles \u2014 his son appears at the widow's chamber window in his shirt \u2014 a similar incident occurs in the Parson's Wed-"], [146, "136 i). l. 1723-1724. ding[and Woman's a Riddle\u2014 but with this difference \u2014in those plays the lovers gain admission into the ladies' chambers without their knowledge, and the ladies consent to a marriage to save their reputations \u2014 whereas in Ram Alley, the widow agrees to reverse the proper order of things, and to take the marriage ceremony last. Pinkethman seems not to have acted after this time\u2014 several of his parts early in the next season, were given to other performers \u2014 in the D. P. of dif ferent plays he is sometimes called Penkethman and sometimes Pmkethman \u2014 it is impossible to de termine which is right, as he signs his name to Love without Interest in 1699 as Will Penkethman ; and to Courtship a-la-mode in 1700 as Will Penkethman \u2014 the Epilogue to the former of these plays is said to be spoken by Penkethman \u2014 in the 10th line of it his name is spelt Penkethman \u2014 he is often called Pmkey, but seldom or never Penkey. He originally held a low rank in the theatre, in 1692 his name appears to a very small character \u2014 on the secession of Betterton and his friends in 1695, he came into better parts and made a visible improve ment till he became the first actor in his line \u2014 he was an imitator of Leigh, but to those who had not seen Leigh, he might well pass for more than a common original : he was rather a droll than a chaste actor, he seems to have been a vast favourite with the Gallery, and to have had a great deal of fun in his counte nance ; the Prologue to the Conscious Lovers says \u2014 \" Some fix all wit and humour in grimace, \" And make a livelihood of Pinbey's face.\""], [147, "d. l. 1723-1724. 137 He had from nature a great deal of comic power but his judgment was not by any means equal to it\u2014 he was apt to insert many things not in his part, and to take great liberties\u2014 if they succeeded all was well ; if he met with a rebuke, he would say to himself, yet loud enough to be heard, \" Odso I believe I am wrong\" \u2014 which once was so well received by the audience, that they turned their reproof into applause. ( Chiefly Cibber.) The instance alluded to by Cibber is probably the same as that related at length by Davies \u2014 the play was the Recruiting Officer \u2014 and when Wilks, as Captain Plume, asked Pinkethman, as one of the Recruits, his name, instead of answering as he ought, he replied, \" Why don't you know my name Bob? \" I thought every fool had known that\" \u2014 Wilks in a rage whispered him Thomas Appletree, the name of the Recruit \u2014 the other retorted aloud \" Thomas \" Appletree ! Thomas Devil ! my name is Will Pin \" kethman\" \u2014 and immediately addressing himself to the upper regions, he said \" Hark ye friend don't you \" know my name?\" ' Yes Master Pinkey,' said a voice from the Gallery ' we know it very well' \u2014 the play house was now in an uproar \u2014 the audience at first enjoyed the folly of Pinkethman, and the distress of Wilks, but the joke growing tiresome they brought the former to his senses with a good hiss. The Tatler pretends to have received a letter from Bullock and Pinkethman requesting him to draw a parallel between them, as he had before done in a few lines, between Wilks and Cibber \u2014 he therefore informs posterity that William Bullock and William"], [148, "138 d. L. 1723-1724. Pinkethman are of the same age, profession and sex \u2014 they both distinguish themselves in a very par ticular manner under the discipline of the crabtree, with this only difference, that Bullock has a more agreeable squall, and Pinkethman a more graceful shrug \u2014 Pinkethman devours a cold chicken with great applause, but Bullock's talent lies chiefly in sparrow grass \u2014 Pinkethman is very dexterous in conveying himself under a table : Bullock is no less active in jumping over a stick : Pinkethman has a great deal of money, but Bullock is the taller man. When Pinkethman first acted Harlequin in the Emperour of the Moon, several gentlemen fancied that a great deal of the drollery and spirit of his gri mace was lost by his wearing of the usual black mask \u2014 they therefore insisted that the next time he acted that part, he should play without it ; which he did accordingly \u2014 but he was no more Harlequin \u2014 his humour was quite disconcerted \u2014 he could not sum mon up the effrontery necessary for the character, without the covering of that unchanging face, which he was sure would never blush for it \u2014 (Cibber) \u2014 see Sep. 18 1702. Davies says, when George the 2d, then Prince of Wales, commanded the comic scenes in Venice Pre served to be revived, Pinkethman acted Antonio and Mrs. Horton Aquilina this is very probable ; but I never saw the character of Aquilina in any play bill, tho' I particularly looked for it. Pinkethman had a theatre of his own at Richmond and usually a booth at Bartholemew Fair \u2014 Downes says in I7O8 \u2014 \" He's the darling of Fortunatus, and"], [149, "n. l. 1723-1724. 139 \" has gained more in Theatres and Fairs in 12 years \" than those who have tugged at the oar of acting \" these 50.\" Pinkethman's characters \u2014 selection only.

PANTOMIMES and ENTERTAINMENTS. The Performers who were under Rich's direction were so inferior to those at D. L. that the latter car ried away all the applause and favour of the town \u2014"], [165, "PANTOMIMES AND ENTERTAINMENTS. 155 Victor says, they could never see any thing like an audience to any play without an interest made for it, till the success of Pantomimes and the Beggar's Opera \u2014 in this distress the Genius of Rich suggested to him a species of entertainment which has always been considered by persons of sense as contemptible, but which at the same time has ever been followed and encouraged \u2014 Pantomimes were brought forward, and as sound and show in the last century obtained a victory over sense and reason ; the same event would have followed again, if the company at D. L. had not, from the experience of past times, thought it advis able to adopt the same measures. The fertility of Rich's invention in these exotic entertainments and the excellence of his own per formance in that line must be ever acknowledged \u2014 by means of these only he kept the managers of the other house from relaxing their diligence ; and to the disgrace of the public taste frequently obtained more money by such ridiculous and paltry exhibitions than all the sterling merit of the rival theatre was able to acquire. (B. D.) Christopher Bullock spoke the Epilogue to 'Tis well if it takes in the character of Harlequin, and Rich before this time had produced some little Harlequin ades in the taste of the Italian Night-scenes, but his Genius does not seem to have blazed forth till about 1723 \u2014 Thurmond who was a dancing master brought out his Pantomime of Harlequin Dr. Faustus at D.L. about the beginning of 1723-1724 \u2014 this Rich seems to have considered as an encroachment on his Preroga tive \u2014 in Dec. 1723 he produced his Necromancer or Dr. Faustus, which was acted with greater success"], [166, "156 PANTOMIMES AND ENTERTAINMENTS. and no doubt gotten up with superior splendour \u2014 to this rivalship between the two Pantomimes the Epi logue to Edwin alludes \u2014 \" Yon rival theatre, by success made great, \" Plotting destruction to our sinking state, \" Turn'd our own arms upon us \u2014 and \u2014 woe'be \" to us, \" They needs must raise the Devil to undo us ! \" Straight our Enchanter gave his spirits wing \" And conjur'd all the town within this ring.\" Cibber speaks very sensibly on this subject and says that he never would have consented to prosti tute a playhouse in which he had a concern by such exhibitions, if there had not been a second theatre \u2014 but as this was the case, they were obliged at D. L. either to comply with the public taste or to starve \u2014 he adds that they made use of their Pantomimes chiefly to support their weak plays. Pope, speaking of the absurdity of these exhibi tions, says, \" When, lo ! to dark encounter in mid air \" New Wizards rise, here Booth and Cibber there : \" Booth in his cloudy tabernacle shrin'd, \" On grinning dragons Cibber mounts the wind.\" To this Cibber in his letter to Pope replies \u2014 \" if \" you figuratively mean by this that I was an en \" courager of those fooleries, you are mistaken, for \" it is not true : if you intend it literally, that I was \" dunce enough to mount a machine, there is as little \" truth in that too.\" What Wilks' opinion on this subject was, does not"], [167, "157 PANTOMIMES AND ENTERTAINMENTS. appear : but Booth went one step farther than Cibber ; and when a number of gentlemen one day in a coffee house gave him their thanks for the extraordinary pleasure they had received the night before from his performance of Varanes, and at the same time civilly blamed him for tacking to so fine a part the senseless stuff of Perseus and Andromeda, adding that it was much beneath the dignity of the theatre, Booth frankly answered, that he thought a thin audience a much greater indignity to the stage than that they had mentioned, and a full one most likely to keep up the spirit of the actor and consequently heighten the re presentation : he begged them to consider that there were many more spectators than men of taste and judgment ; and if by the artifice of a Pantomime, they could entice a greater number to partake of a good play than could be drawn without it, he could not see any great harm in it : that as these pieces were performed after the play they were no interrup tion to it, and for his part he confessed he considered profit as well as fame ; and as Aaron Hill had justly observed, he could not think it was the business of the managers to be wise to empty boxes. (Theo. Cibber?) Booth seems eagerly to have caught at an expres sion of Hill's, who was certainly no friend to Panto mimes, as appears from his Snake in the Grass \u2014 Victor tells us, that Booth had contracted a love for money. Theophilus Cibber (in his life of Booth) observes, that however the severer critics might cry out against these mummeries, as they often called them ; yet as the managers found laying out some hundreds on a"], [168, "PANTOMIMES AND ENTERTAINMENTS. 158 piece of this description would bring them in as many thousands, who can be surprised that they con tinued them, while they turned so much to their ac- count ? As plays were then usually acted at common prices, viz. Boxes 4s, Pit 2s and 6d, First Gallery Is and 6d, Upper Gallery Is, their receipts made a much better figure in the office, when by a Pantomime they were enabled to advance their prices to Boxes 5s, &c, and so considerably encreased the number of their spectators, that instead of receiving (at com mon prices) about \u00a3500 per week, they generally found the sum total of 6 days' playing amounted to near \u00a31000\u2014 so great was the run to many of these Entertainments, that the advanced prices by their fre quent use became rather the common prices \u2014 what were called advanced prices, till then, had been taken only on very particular occasions ; such as Benefit- Nights, or the first run of a new or revived play new dressed &c. It was objected that those who were desirous to see a play were obliged to pay an advanced price for what they did not want to see\u2014 \u2014 to this objection Theo. Cibber started a remedy which the managers approved, and by his advice a N. B. was inserted in the Bills to this effect \u2014 \" the Advance-Money to be \" returned to those who choose to go out before the \" Overture to the Entertainment\" this silenced the clamour against the advanced prices, and the managers did not find the receipts much lessened by it, for it may be questioned if there was a demand for the return of \u00a320 in 10 years see D.

When Booth last appeared on the stage he was but in his 46th year \u2014 he continued ill a long time ; and his friends had frequent hopes of his recovery \u2014 he died May 8 1733 \u2014 about a month before his death he seemed to be better \u2014 he would sometimes talk what characters he proposed to revive and plan ope rations for the ensuing winter \u2014 when intervening health would permit, he was pursuing his studies,"], [221, "d. l. 1727-1728. 211 often revolving in his mind past negligences and searching after new beauties, which he hoped to live to put into execution ; he knew the longest life was too short for the almost endless study of an actor. (Theo. Cibber.) He had learning to understand perfectly what it was his part to speak, and judgment to know how it agreed or disagreed with his character \u2014 hence arose a peculiar grace which was visible to every spectator, tho' few were at the pains of examining into the cause of their pleasure \u2014 he could soften and slide over with an elegant negligence the improprieties of a part he acted, while on the contrary he could dwell with energy upon the beauties, as if he exerted a latent spirit, which he had kept back for such an occasion, that he might alarm, awaken and transport in those places only, which were worthy of his best exertions \u2014 (Aaron Hill) \u2014 he had certainly all the advantages that Art or Nature could bestow to make an admirable actor \u2014 the tones of his voice were all musical ; and he had so excellent an ear, that no one ever heard a dissonant note come from him ; he was not only harmonious, but properly so, while he filled the ear, he spoke to the heart \u2014 his articulation was so excellent, that he was heard to the farthest part of the theatre when he almost whispered \u2014 his voice was never known to fail him, yet he was not so lavish as to throw it away on any unnecessary occasion \u2014 he despised a Ranter and scorned to pur chase applause at the expense of his lungs and the disgrace of his judgment his attitudes were all picturesque, his general deportment was majestic his madness in Lear is hardly to be described, never p 2"], [222, "212 D.

(Theo. Cibber.) Davies says, no one who has acted the Ghost in Hamlet since Booth, has been at all equal to him \u2014 his slow, solemn, and under-tone of voice, his noise less tread and his whole deportment inspired the au dience with awful astonishment\u2014 the gay libertine air he gave to Polydore has not been equalled since ; tho' Walker his pupil was more than a tolerable copy of his master. In acting Othello one night to a small audience he was languid for the first 2 acts ; in the 3d as if roused from a lethargy to the most animating vigour, he displayed such uncommon fire and force that"], [223, "d. _. 1727-1728. 213 when he retired into the Green-room, Cibber asked him what had inspired him so on a sudden ? \u2014 \" why,\" said Booth, \" I saw by chance an Oxford \" man in the Pit, whose judgment I revere more \" than that of a whole audience.\" During the time of his indisposition he was frequently able to go to the theatre, tho' not able to perform \u2014 Wilks was called on to play 2 of his parts \u2014 Jaffier and Hastings Victor told Davies that Booth was not pleased with the applause which Wilks received\u2014 see April 15 and Oct. 17 1730. Booth has been known to read a scene in a part acted by Betterton to the admiration of his hearers \u2014 but when asked why he would not so represent the part throughout, his constant answer was, that it was too much for him \u2014 he took from his great exemplar what he could and fitted it to his own powers and manner. (Davies.) Aaron Hill observes that tho' in the customary rounds of business he played several parts in Comedy, yet he seldom appeared in any of them much to his advantage \u2014 the passions which he found in Comedy were not strong enough to excite his fire, and what seemed want of qualification, was only absence of impression \u2014 Booth played many Walking Gentlemen, and to those parts Hill's observation is no doubt ap plicable ; but when Booth acted a part in Comedy that was worthy of his attention this was not the case \u2014 Theo. Cibber says, if Booth had never ap peared in Tragedy, he would have been considered as an excellent actorfrom his performance in Comedy, and appeals to those who had seen him in Young Bevil \u2014 Pinchwife \u2014 the Plain Dealer \u2014 Scandal \u2014"], [224, "d. l. 1727-1728. 214 Heartfree and many other parts to justify his asser tion\u2014Colley Cibber says Booth failed in Essex plaintive distress did not suit him.

(Davies.) This play, written in ridicule of the Musical Italian Drama, was first offered to Cibber and his brethren at D. L. and rejected by them \u2014 it being then carried to Rich had the effect, as was ludicrously said, of making Gay rich and BicJi gay. Spence has given the original and progress of it in Pope's words \u2014 \" Dr. Swift had been observing once \" to Mr. Gay, what an odd pretty sort of thing a \" Newgate Pastoral might make \u2014 Gay was inclined \" to try such a thing for some time ; but afterwards \" thought it would be better to write a Comedy on \" the same plan \u2014 this was what gave rise to the \" Beggar's Opera \u2014 he began on it ; and when first \" he mentioned it to Swift, the Doctor did not much \" like the project \u2014 as he carried it on, he shewed"], [232, "222 l. i. f. 1727-1728. \" what he wrote to both of us, and we now and then \" gave a correction or a word or two of advice, but \" it was wholly of his own writing\u2014 when it wa. \" done neither of us thought it would succeed\u2014 we \" showed it to Congreve ; who said, it would either \" take greatly, or be damned confoundedly\u2014 we were \" all, at the first night of it, in great uncertainty of \" the event ; till we were much encouraged by over \" hearing the Duke of Argyle, who sat in the next \" box to us, say, ' It will do \u2014 it must do!

Both these decisions are surely exaggerated \u2014 the play, like many others, was plainly written only to divert, without any moral purpose, and is therefore not likely to do good \u2014 nor can it be conceived, with out more speculation than life requires or admits, to be productive of much evil \u2014 highwaymen and house breakers seldom frequent the play-house, or mingle in any elegant diversion ; nor is it possible for any one to imagine that he may rob with safety, because he sees Macheath reprieved upon the stage. (Dr. Johnson.) Such is the determination of that strict Moralist Dr. Johnson \u2014 the clamour however still continues \u2014 about 1772 Sir John Fielding sent letters to the Managers of D. L. and C. G. advising them not to perform the Beggar's Opera, as it tended to encrease the number of thieves \u2014 Garrick (who had no good Singer except Vernon) affected to approve of what Sir John Fielding said \u2014 Column's answer was as fol lows \u2014 \" Mr. Colman's compts. to Sir J.

Notwithstanding all the merits of this piece, it is much to be wished that it had never been written, as its success has entailed on us from that time to this, those bastard Comedies styled Operas\u2014 most of which have been miserably inferior to the Prototype, and many of them little more than mere vehicles for the Songs if however Operas were confined to a Theatre of their own (as of late years at the Lyceum) it would not be much amiss \u2014 but to have Hamlet at D. L. or C. G. one night, and Artaxerxes the next is abominable. Steevens, on the celebrated passage in the Mer chant of Venice \" the man that has no Music in \" himself\" &c. \u2014 observes \u2014 \" this passage which is \" neither pregnant with physical or moral truth, nor \" poetically beautiful in an eminent degree, has con \" stantly enjoyed the good fortune to be repeated by \" those, whose inhospitable memories would have \" refused to admit or retain any other sentiment of \" the same author, however exalted or just \u2014 the truth \" is, that it furnishes the vacant fiddler, with some \" thing to say in defence of his profession ; and sup \" plies the Coxcomb in Music, with an invective \" against such as do not pretend to discover all the \" various powers of language in inarticulate sounds.\" Lord Chesterfield in his 148th letter to his son, after having enumerated music among the illiberal pleasures, adds \u2014 \" if you love music, hear it ; go to \" Operas, Concerts, and pay fiddlers to play to you; \" but I must insist upon your neither piping nor"], [235, "l. i. f. 1727-1728. 225 \" fiddling yourself\u2014 it puts a gentleman in a very \" frivolous contemptible light ; brings him into a \" great deal of bad company, and takes up a \" great deal of time, which might be much better \" employed \u2014 few things would mortify me more, \" than to see you bearing a part in a Concert, \" with a fiddle under your chin, or a pipe in your \" mouth.\" Again, letter 153, \" A taste of sculpture and \" painting is, in my mind, as becoming as a taste of \" fiddling and piping is unbecoming a man of fashion \" \u2014 the former is connected with history and poetry, \" the latter with nothing that I know of, but bad \" company\" \u2014 Again \u2014 \" Painting and sculpture are \" very justly called liberal arts ; a lively and strong \" imagination, together with a just observation, being \" absolutely necessary to excel in either ; which, in \" my opinion, is by no means the case in music, \" though called a liberal art, and now in Italy placed \" above the other two \u2014 a proof of the decline of that \" country.\" (Steevens.)

D. L. 1729-1730. In the Biographia Dramatica Sir Richard Steele is said to have died Sept. 21 1729, after having retired to his seat near Carmarthen in Wales \u2014 but Victor in his 1 20th letter says \u2014 \" Steele left London \" in 1725, and retired to Hereford, where he was \" lodged and boarded at the house of a mercer, who \" was his agent, and receiver of the rents of an \" encumbered estate of \u00a3600 a year, which Sir \" Richard obtained by his late wife 1 was told, he \" retained his cheerful sweetness of temper to the \" last; and would often be carried out in a summer's \" evening, where the country lads and lasses were"], [259, "d. l. 1729-1730. 249 \" assembled at their rural sports\u2014 and with his pencil \" give an order on his agent, the mercer, for a new \" gown to the best dancer.\" Dr. Johnson in his life of Addison says \u2014 \" Steele \" whose imprudence of generosity, or vanity of pro \" fusion, kept him always incurably necessitous, \" upon some pressing exigence, in an evil hour, \" borrowed \u00a3100 of his friend Addison, probably \" without much purpose of repayment ; but Addison \" who seems to have had other notions of \u00a3100, \" grew impatient of delay, and reclaimed his loan \" by an execution. Steele felt with great sensibility \" the obduracy of his creditor ; but with emotions \" of sorrow rather than of anger.\" Victor's account of this matter is worth attention, as it seems more correct than Dr. Johnson's, and places Addison's conduct in a very different light \u2014 Steele built an elegant small house adjoining to the side of the Palace at Hampton \u2014 he furnished it completely, and lived in it a few years with the utmost delight ; but as he was a stranger to \u0153conomy he was often embarrassed \u2014 and at last compelled to apply to Addison to lend him a thousand pounds, on a mortgage of the house and furniture, which request was complied with, and his attorney directed to draw a bond and judgment, payable in 12 months \u2014 at the expiration of which, Steele not having the thousand pounds to repay, Addison's attorney entered up an execution the house and furniture were sold, and the surplus arising to Steele was sent him, with a genteel letter from Addison, to assign his friendly reason for taking so extraordinary a step, viz. to try (if possible) to"], [260, "250 d. l. 1729-1730. awake him from that lethargy, which must end in his inevitable ruin. Steele received that letter with his usual philosophical composure ; and met his friend with the same gaiety of temper that he had always done ; and which subsisted during Addison's life. Victor says he had this anecdote from Wilks, and adds \u2014 \" during the last year which Steele passed in \" London, I seldom missed seeing him in some part \" of every day \u2014 and being always delighted with his \" old stories, I ventured when I found him in the \" vein, to mention the above remarkable anecdote \u2014 \" he told me it was literally true \u2014 and that he re \" ceived it, as he believed it was meant by his friend, \" to do him service.\" The Theatre opened Sep. 11, but there are no bills till\u2014 Sep. 20.

Porter played the parts originally. Mrs. Henrietta Moor was at one time in possession of a respectable line of parts, but latterly she dwin dled down to very inferiour characters \u2014 she probably left the stage about this time. Mrs. Anne Oldfield died Oct. 23 1730 in her 47th year \u2014 Curll published a Life of Mrs. Oldfield in 86 pages, which contain but little theatrical information \u2014 according to him, her first appearance on the stage was in 1699, when on the temporary retirement of Mrs. Cross, she succeeded to her part of Candiope in Secret Love \u2014 her second part was Alinda in the Pil grim; and on the death of Mrs. Verbruggen she obtained the part of Lady Lurewell \u2014 Curll's account does not exactly agree with what Cibber says, but the difference is not material \u2014 Curll seems not to have published his account of Mrs. Oldfield till 1741 \u2014 but some Memoirs of her, in a small pamphlet,"], [271, "d. l. 1729-1730. 261 were published soon after her death \u2014 the 4th edition of this pamphlet was printed in 1730. Mrs. Oldfield was in person tall, genteel and well shaped ; her countenance was pleasing and expres sive, enlivened with large speaking eyes, which in some particular Comic situations, she kept half shut ; especially when she intended to give effect to some brilliant or gay thought: in sprightliness of air and elegance of manner she excelled all actresses, and was greatly superiour in the clear, sonorous, and har monious tones of her voice \u2014 (Davies)\u2014 after her success in Lady Betty Modish all that nature had given her of the actress seemed to have risen to its full perfection ; but the variety of her powers could not be known, till she was seen in variety of cha racters, which as fast as they fell to her she equally excelled in \u2014 in the wearing of her person she was particularly fortunate, her figure was always improv ing to her 36th year : but her excellence in acting was never at a stand ; and Lady Townly, one of her last new parts, was a proof that she was still able to do more, if more could have been done for her. (Cibber.) Wilks' Copper Captain was esteemed one of his best characters; Mrs. Oldfield was equally happy in Estifania ; when she drew the pistol from her pocket, pretending to shoot Perez, Wilks drew back as if greatly terrified, and in a tremulous voice uttered \" what thy own husband ?\" she replied with an arch ness of countenance and a half shut eye \" let mine \" own husband then, be in's own wits\" in a tone of voice in imitation of his, that the theatre was in a tumult of applause."], [272, "262 d. l. 1729-1730. When Ryan and Mrs. Younger acted these parts at L. I. F. it was universally allowed, that tho' they were Comedians of great merit, they fell infinitely short of Wilks and Mrs. Oldfield. (Davies.) Cibber says nothing of her performance in Tra gedy, but Chetwood speaks highly of her Cleopatra and Calista \u2014 and it is certain that she acted several first rate parts in Tragedy much to the satisfaction of the Town \u2014 she had for some time a dislike to Tragedy, she would often say \" I hate to have a Page \" dragging my tail about ; Why do they not give Por \" ter these parts? She can put on a better Tragedy \" face than I can \" \u2014 when Mithridates was revived, it was with much difficulty that she was prevailed on to take the part assigned her, but she performed it to perfection, and after that she seemed much better reconciled to Tragedy. (Chetwood.) She had one mark of good sense rarely known in a performer of eminence \u2014 to the last year of her life she never undertook any part she liked, without being importunately desirous of having all the help in it, that another could possibly give her; but it was a hard matter to give her a hint that she was not able to improve \u2014 with all her merit, she was less pre suming in her station, than several who had not half her pretensions to be troublesome to the Ma nagers : but she lost nothing by her easy conduct ; she had every thing she asked, which she took care should be always reasonable, because she hated as much to be grudged as denied a civility.

Cibber says of Wilks, that if he was not the most correct or most judicious, yet, take him for all in all, he was certainly the most diligent, the most labori ous and most useful actor that he had seen on the stage for 50 years \u2014 Wilks' passion was fame, he seemed to have no joy in life but to be distinguished on the stage, he was always sure there to do his best, and willingly underwent constant labour by his example and authority he prevented negligence in the other actors tho' his forte was gay Comedy, yet when he acted Tragedy, in sorrow, tenderness and resignation, he seemed pathetically to feel, look and express the character.

The persons who mention Wilks, generally speak ing, content themselves with saying, that he excelled all actors of his time in genteel and lively Comedy, but seldom enter into particulars, whereas they labour to persuade us that he played Tragedy well. Wilks was so genteely elegant in his fancy of dress for the stage, that he was often followed in 1ns fashion, tho' in the street his plainness of habit was remarkable. (Chetwood.) An eminent critic speaking of Wilks in 1729 said \u2014 \" whatever he did upon the stage, let it be ever so \" trifling, whether it consisted in putting on his \" gloves, or taking out his watch, Jolling on his cane, \" or taking snuff, every movement was marked with \" such an ease of breeding and manner, every thing \" told so strongly the involuntary motion of a gentle \" man, that it was impossible to consider the cha \" racter he represented in any other light than that \" of reality\u2014 \u2014 but what was still more surprising, \" that person who could thus delight an audience \" from the gaiety and sprightliness of his manner, \" I met the next day in the street hobbling to a \" hackney coach, seemingly so enfeebled by age and \" infirmities, that I could scarcely believe him to be \" the same man.\" Chetwood says that WTilks was the first proposer in any joint charity from the theatrical slock, and often prevailed upon the unwilling liberality of the other Managers ; his care of Farquhar's Orphan VOL.

Wilks seems to have carried his generosity rather too far \u2014 a man who for more than 20 years had been in the receipt of \u00a31000 per ann. should not have left his widow in a precarious situation \u2014 the London Magazine for December 1732 says \u2014 \" the case of \" Mrs. Wilks deserves the utmost concern : the \" humane temper and universal benevolence of her \" late husband having left her little, besides her \" share in the Patent for her support.\" A Life of Wilks was published in 1732 by Slow \u2014 it was written by a person who called himself Daniel O'Bryan Esquire, and who said that a particular intimacy had subsisted between himself and Wilks from their childhoods to the time of Wilks' death.

I. F. in 1714 told him, that the greatest grievance they had to complain of at D. L. was the passionate speeches which Wilks on every slight occasion would make use of. Wilks was no doubt passionate, but who can believe all that Cibber tells us on this point ? \u2014 the deserters were certainly tempted to go to L. I. F. by the pro mise of better pay and better parts \u2014 as Wilks has not told his own story, let the author of the Laureat speak for him- he thus addresses Cibber \u2014 \" One \" may easily conceive the foundation of your malice \" to Wilks \u2014 his crime was merit \u2014 it is, and was, \" the opinion of most people, both within and with \" out the doors of the theatre, that he was the cor \" ner-stone that supported it \u2014 if he sometimes chas \" tised you with his tongue, were not your idleness, \" your neglect of your business, your tyrannical be \" haviour to your inferiours, the occasions of his \" rebuking you ? \u2014 did not you often hurt the thea \" trical affairs by your avarice and ill conduct ? \u2014 \" did you not by your geueral misbehaviour towards \" authors and actors, bring an odium on your brother \" managers, as well as yourself? I have been assured, \" no person who ever had power on the stage, was \" ever so universally odious to the actors as yourself; \" and these were the reasons which might sometimes \" provoke Wilks to treat you with the same asperity \" you used to others \u2014 your partiality is so notorious,"], [354, "344 d. l. 1731-1732. \" with relation to Wilks, that every one sees you \" never praise him, but to rail at him ; and only oil \" your hone, to whet your rasor.\" The naturally close and sullen dispositions of Dog get and Cibber, quite opposite to Wilks' open and generous mind, must now and then clash and occasion convulsions in their affairs \u2014 Dogget's great anxiety was to take advantage of the rise and fall of the Stocks; Cibber was addicted to gaming and all man ner of pleasure \u2014 what could Wilks, who was a man of regularity and intent on the credit of the theatre, do wfth such partners as a stock-jobber and a gamester ? in the decorations of plays they grudged every necessary expense, while his spirit took plea sure in dressing every character as it ought to be, and furnishing such other ornaments as the plays re quired. (Davies and Laureat.) Cibber himself says \u2014 \" Dogget, who was naturally \" an \u0153conomist, kept our expenses and accounts to \" the best of his power within regulated bounds : \" Wilks, who had a stronger passion for glory than \" gain, was apt to be lavish : for example at the be \" ginning of almost every season he would order two \" or three suits to be made or refreshed for actors of \" moderate consequence, that his having constantly a \" new one for himself might seem less particular, \" tho' he had as yet no new part for it : this Dogget \" always looked on with the eye of a man in pain : \" but I (tho' I liked the matter as little as Dogget \" himself) only commended his fancy, or at most \" whispered him not to give himself so much trouble \" r.bout others upon whose performance it would be \" thrown away : Wilks with an air of triumph replied"], [355, "d.l. 1731-1732. 345 \" \u2014 ' why now that was what I really did it for, to \" show others that I love to take care of them, as \" well as of myself.' \" Here Cibber without intending it places Wilks' conduct in an advantageous point of view ; at the time that he complains of Wilks' profusion, each of the Managers, by his own acknowledgment, cleared \u00a31000 a year. Wilks as Manager was the most reprehensible for his partiality to Mills : which seems to have been as much owing to jealousy of Booth, as to friendship for Mills \u2014 on Verbruggen's death (see Hay. Nov. 15 1707) when Wilks was himself only a hired actor, he with a high hand gave Pierre to Mills, who had no pretensions to that part in comparison with Booth then young as he was. (Cibber.) Of the three Managers Cibber was for many reasons the least esteemed by the players \u2014 the author of the Laureat says \u2014 \" several of the surviving actors are \" ready to testify, that he was always against raising \" or rewarding, or by any means encouraging merit \" of any kind ; they know how many disputes he \" had with Wilks on this account, who was impatient, \" when justice required it, to reward the meritorious\" \u2014 this is probably an exaggerated account \u2014 see what Theo. Cibber says Nov. 1727- The manner in which the three Managers treated dramatic writers is thus represented by the author of the Laureat. \" The Court sitting, Chancellor Cibber (for the \" two others sat only for form's sake) nodded to the \" author to open his manuscript\u2014 the author begins \" to read\u2014 in which if he failed to please the corrector,"], [356, "346 d. l. 1731-1732. \" he would sometimes condescend to read it himself \" \u2014 if the play struck him \u2014 as it would if he found \" any thing new in it, and he thought he could par \" ticularly shine in it as an actor \u2014 he would lay down \" his pipe (for the Chancellor always smoked when \" he made a decree) and cry ' by Heaven there is \" something in this \u2014 I do not know but it may do \u2014 \" I will play such a part' \u2014 when the reading was \" finished, he made his corrections and sometimes \" without any propriety.\" Davies is not surprised, that Wilks, who was a man of plain good sense, but without a learned education, should thus submit to Cibber's judgment, but oberves that Booth's resignation of his understanding to an inferiour must be resolved into an habitual love of ease to this indolence of Booth it is probably owing that Cibber makes little or no complaint of him in his Apology. After all that has been said against Chancellor Cibber, it does not appear that he often made a wrong decree : most of the good plays came out at D. L. \u2014 nor am I aware that Cibber is much to be blamed for rejecting any play, except the Siege of Damascus in the first instance. Cibber very properly observes \u2014 \" among the many \" disagreeable circumstances attending the manage \" ment of a theatre, one was the persecution we so \" often met with from bad authors, tho' I am not \" conscious we ever did any of them the least injury \" \u2014 yet this was not all we had to struggle with ; to \" supersede our right of rejecting a play, the recom \" mendation, or rather imposition, of some great \" persons (whom it was not prudent to disoblige)"], [357, "d. l. 1731-1732. 347 \" sometimes came in to support their pretensions ; \" and then, co ut que cout, acted it must be ! so when \" the short life of this wonderful nothing was over, \" the actors were perhaps abused in a preface for \" obstructing the success of it, and the Town pub \" lickly damned us for our private civility.\" \" Thus was our administration often censured for \" circumstances, which it was not in our power to \" prevent \u2014 if therefore some plays were brought on \" the stage, that were never fit to have been seen \" there, let this be our excuse for it \u2014 and let our \" merit in rejecting many bad plays, which were \" pressed upon us, be weighed against the few that \" were thus imposed upon us.\" Thus far Cibber's conduct to authors seems to have been as little censurable as that of any Manager before his time or since \u2014 but the author of the Lau reat brings two heavy charges against him ; in both of which there seems to be too much truth \u2014 he accuses him of pilfering scenes from manuscript plays which had been put into his hands, as Manager \u2014 see Double Gallant Hay. Nov. 1 1707 \u2014 and taxes him with taking delight in rebuffing dramatic writers, and calling that pastime of his the Choaking of Singing- Birds \u2014 he relates the particulars of Cibber's insolence to Fenton\u2014 (see Mariamne L. I. F. Feb. 22 1723)\u2014 and adds \u2014 \" a certain young Gentleman applied to \" you as Corrector of D. L. to look over his piece \" and see if you thought it fit for representation ; \" you turned over the first leaf, and having read only \" two lines, you returned it with these words, ' Sir \" it will not do ' \u2014 full of this adventure you came to \" Button's ready to split with laughter ; you related"], [358, "348 l. i. f. 1731-1732. \" this incident to your friend Col.

(Chetwood.) Cibber concludes his Apology in a hasty manner, Avithout mentioning the precise time when he left the stage, or sold his interest in the theatre \u2014 he seems to have been engaged as an actor at 12 Guineas per week (Gent's Mag.)\u2014 this however lasted but a short time. Cibber had been on the stage more than 40 years \u2014 the author of the Laureat says \u2014 \" he was in sta \" ture of the middle size, his complexion fair, in \" clinable to the sandy, his legs somewhat of the \" thickest, his shape a little clumsy, not irregular, \" and his voice rather shrill than loud or articulate, \" and cracked extremely when he endeavoured to \" raise it : he was in his younger days so lean, as to \" be known by the name of Hatchet Face \" \u2014 see"], [386, "376 d. L. 1732-1733. Epilogue to Lady's last Stake \u2014 the Gentleman's Magazine says \u2014 \" his shape was finely proportioned, \" yet not graceful, easy, but not striking ; when he \" represented a ridiculous humour he had a mouth \" in every nerve, and became eloquent without speak \" ing : his attitudes were pointed and exquisite ; his \" expression was stronger than painting : he was \" beautifully absorbed by the character, and demanded \" and monopolized attention : his very extravagancies \" were coloured with propriety.\" Cibber speaking of himself soon after he came on the stage says, \" the first thing that enters into the \" head of a young actor is the desire of being a hero ; \" in which ambition I was soon snubbed by the in \" sufficiency of my voice, and my dismal pale com \" plexion, so that I had but a melancholy prospect of \" ever playing a lover to Mrs. Bracegirdle : what \" was most promising in me was the aptness of my \" ear, for 1 was soon allowed to speak justly, tho' \" what was grave and serious did not equally become \" me \" \u2014 all through his Apology he speaks modestly of his own acting : he mentions, with some degree of complacency, his performance of Wolsey \u2014 Fondle wife \u2014 Sir Fopling Flutter^Iago \u2014 Syphax \u2014 Richard the 3d \u2014 Bayes\u2014 Sir Courtly Nice \u2014 \u00c6sop \u2014 Shallow and Lord Foppington : and this surely was no more than he might do without censure. Davies says he excelled in a variety of Comic cha racters, but his perfection of acting was the coxcomb of quality, and especially Lord Foppington in the Careless Husband ; as the fashions of the times altered, he adjusted his action and behaviour to them and introduced every species of growing foppery \u2014"], [387, "d.l. 1732-1733. 377 Davies commends his Sir John Brute \u2014 (see C. G. April 20 1749) \u2014 and especially his Justice Shallow, but reprobates his Wolsey and Iago Cibber played many parts in Tragedy, but seems to have failed in that line of acting ; the Gentleman's Maga zine says, Quin was sometimes wrong in his Tragic parts, Cibber was always so. Foote used to say of Garrick \u2014 \" yes, the hound \" has something clever, but if his excellence was to \" be examined, he would not be found in any part \" equal to Colley Cibber's Sir John Brute, Lord \" Foppington, Sir Courtly Nice, or Justice Shallow\" \u2014 (Wilkinson) \u2014 tho' this was evidently said with a view to depreciate Garrick, yet it is still a proof of the high opinion Foote had of Cibber in these cha racters. Davies says that when Cibber played Shallow after his return to the stage, the audience were quite de lighted with seeing him again and in one of his best parts : his transition from asking the price of ewes, to trite but grave reflections on mortality, was so natural and attended with such an unmeaning roll of his small pigs-eyes, that perhaps no actor was ever superiour in the conception and execution of such solemn insignificany \u2014 Davies adds \u2014 \" On Dogget's \" leaving the stage, the part had been given to John \" son, but on Johnson's being ill, Cibber made him \" self master of it, and performed it so much to the \" satisfaction of the public, that he retained it as \" long as he continued on the stage : on his retiring \" Johnson resumed the part when he was between \" 70 and 80 : but tho' he was chaste in his colouring \" and correct in his drawing, he wanted the high"], [388, "378 d. l. 1732-1733. \" finishing and warm tints of Cibber \u2014 whether John \" son considered his being deprived of Shallow for \" almost 20 years, as a Manager's trick, or dishonest \" ma\u0153uvre of Cibber, is not known ; but the old \" man never spoke of him with any complacency.\" Betterton brought out his alteration of the 2d part of Henry 4th about 1701 \u2014 Johnson belonged to the other theatre \u2014 as Betterton did not publish his alteration, it is highly improbable that it should have been acted at D. L. before the re-union of the two companies in 1708 when it was revived at D. L. in 1720, it was said in the bill not to have been acted for 17 years \u2014 it seems therefore impossible to assign any time at which Johnson could have played Shal low before Cibber Johnson might possibly be offended at Cibber for resuming the part on his return to the stage\u2014 that Dogget played Shallow, when Betterton brought out his alteration, is ex tremely probable, but as the play was not printed till 1720, one would like to know on what authority Davies affirmed the fact.

Cibber wrote, or altered, about 25 dramatic pieces \u2014his Tragedies are almost forgotten, and several of his Comedies are become obsolete \u2014 he was a great plagiary, but he frequently altered for the better what he borrowed \u2014 he fails most in the dialogue, which is often flimsy, and sometimes very dull ; for this reason his bustling Comedy of She wou'd and She wou'd not is perhaps his best play. In 1721 he published a superb edition of his works in Quarto, from which he excluded 2 or 3 of his worst plays \u2014 another edition of his works was printed in small Octavo \u2014 this edition has Woman's W7it, but not Xerxes. As an author we are the most obliged to Cibber for the Apology for his life, the dedication of which is dated Nov. 6 1739 \u2014 as soon as it reached Dublin, Faulkner the Printer sent it to Swift, who told him the next day, that Cibber's book had captivated him, and that he sat up all night to read it through \u2014 when Cibber heard this he was highly delighted \u2014 (Davies) \u2014 this testimony was the more honourable to Cibber, as Swift was the intimate friend of Pope \u2014 Cibber is said to have made \u00a31500 by his Apology.

L. till he obtained an engagement ; there seems therefore no reason for supposing that he had ever been in a strolling com pany \u2014 that he was hissed in the small parts at first assigned him, is probably said at random the Mar riage-hater Matched (1692) is the only play in which I have met with Cibber's name as Mr. Colly \u2014 that it was frequently thus written has every appearance of being a false assertion."], [395, "d. l. 1732-1733. 385 The Laureat, and particularly the life of \u00c6sopus, are well written \u2014 they contain some theatrical information \u2014 the vindication of Wilks does the author credit \u2014 but in justice to Cibber we ought to read them with a certain degree of distrust, as the work of an inveterate enemy. The author taxes Cibber with forgetting that Booth acted Jaffier \u2014 nothing can be more certain than that Booth did not play Jaffier at the time of which Cib ber is speaking. Cibber, in his Apology, suppresses the name of his 2d play (Woman's Wit) which was damned \u2014 the au thor of the Laureat says \u2014 \" let my ill-natured me \" mory supply that defect, it was called Perolla and \" Izadora\" \u2014 he adds p. 101 \u2014 \" the Critics who have \" mentioned it say, (for there is not one tittle of the \"piece come down to us) that it was the strangest and \" most unnatural stuff that ever was written. Nobody \" understood the story ; nobody ever heard of the \" names of his heroes ; nobody from the beginning \" to the end could conceive what was meant.\" Cibber must have triumphed at the gross igno rance of the subject displayed in this paragraph\u2014 as Woman's Wit and Perolla and Izadora were both in print, the blunder is inexcusable \u2014 the assertion about Perolla and Izadora is peculiarly unfortunate \u2014 as that Tragedy is founded on history, and the names of 3 of the principal characters occur in the 23d book of Livy. It is particularly worthy of observation, that the author of the Laureat had not the wit to attack Cib ber in his most vulnerable part\u2014 his shameful negli gence as to dates. VOL. III. C C"], [396, "386 d. l. 1732-1733. Cibber succeeded Eusden as Poet Laureat in 1730 \u2014 it was said of Cibber \u2014 \" as an actor, he had un \" doubted merit ; as a dramatic writer, his character \" was both good and bad ; as Laureat, he was un \" questionably the worst that ever was\" \u2014 his Odes were for some years published in the Magazines, and turned into ridicule ; his new year's Ode for 1736 is followed by a Pastoral dialogue \u2014 Strephon. Colley has tuned again his fife Thyrsis. Has he? 'slife. Strephon. Nor is he yet quite out of breath. Thyrsis. Not yet ? 'sdeath. Fielding in Pasquin, 1736, makes Lord Place pro mise one of the Voters to get him appointed Poet Laureat. Voter. Poet ! no my Lord, I am no Poet, I can't make verses. Lord Place. No matter for that \u2014 you'll be able to make Odes. Voter. Odes my Lord ! what are those ? Lord Place. Faith, Sir, I cannot tell well what they are ; but I know you may be qualified for the place without being a Poet. Cibber himself says in his Apology \" as a little bad \" poetry is the greatest crime our most celebrated \" living author in his satirical works lays to my charge, \" I am willing to subscribe to his opinion of it.\" Malone tells us that in Dryden's time the Poet Laureat was not subjected to the drudgery of making Odes. Cibber in his letter to Pope 1742 says \u2014 \" In your \" remarks on the Dunciad you inform us that Eusden"], [397, "d. l. 1732-1733. 387 \" no sooner died, but his place of Laureat was sup \" plied by Cibber, on which was made the following \" Epigram, (may I not believe by yourself?) \" In merry old England it once was a rule, \" The King had his Poet and also his Fool. \" But now we're so frugal, I'd have you to know it, \" That Cibber can serve both for Fool and for Poet. \" A good jest is a good thing let it fall upon who \" it will : I dare say Cibber would never have com \" plained of Mr. Pope, if he had never said any worse \" of him.\" In the Egotist 1743 Cibber is made to say \u2014 \" upon the first day of a new piece at the Hay., when \" a personal jest upon me flew souce in my face, \" while I sat in the eye of a full audience, was I not \" as suddenly loud in my laugh and applause, as any \" common spectator ?\" \u2014 it was probably at the joke about his Odes that Cibber laughed \u2014 he would hardly have been able to raise a laugh, when Fielding at tacked him for mangling Shakspeare. Pope in several of his attacks on Cibber, was per sonal and illiberal \u2014 Fielding only attacked Cibber's works, and his remarks were not more severe than just \u2014 that Cibber was much hurt at them is evident from what he says of Fielding, whom he does not name, but describes as a broken Wit \u2014 he has the vanity to say \" I shall not give the particular strokes \" of his ingenuity a chance to be remembered by re \" citing them.\" cc 2"], [398, "388 l. i.

Pa tent as a good stake in an establishment, which he thought much surer than his own. ( Victor.) Victor in I76I says \u2014 Two weeks had not passed before all the principal performers (Mrs. Clive, Mrs. Horton and Bridgewater excepted) revolted from the Patentees and set up for themselves at the little Theatre in the Hay. \u2014 and in his preface to Altamira 1776 he tells us, that his play had been rehearsed 2 or 3 times before the conspiracy broke out \u2014 it seems strange that Victor should have made a mistake, even after a lapse of years, in a point in which he was so much concerned\u2014 yet it is certain, that the principal actors did not play at D. L. till March 12 1734\u2014 and that their intention of playing at the Hay. had been announced to the public at Bartholemew Fair. Victor adds \u2014 \" The violence of this transaction \" was at this juncture so notorious, that it immedi \" ately threw the whole town into parties \u2014 the \" friends to the Seceders urged that the actors were \" a free people and not to be sold with the Patent, \" as slaves with a plantation in the West Indies \u2014 at \" this time there were no articles subsisting between the \" managers and the actors\" \u2014 but tho' the actors were under no obligation to continue with the Patentees, yet it does not appear that they had any particular grievance to complain of ; and their return to D. L. so soon after seems to prove that in this instance they acted capriciously and injudiciously their salaries per week at D. L. were as follows \u2014 Theophilus Cibber for himself and wife, who did"], [413, "d. l. 1733-1734, 403 but little \u00a35\u2014 Mills Jun. for himself and wife, who was of little use, \u00a33\u2014 Mills Sen. \u00a31 per day\u2014 for 200 days certain \u2014 and a clear benefit \u2014 Johnson and Miller \u00a35 each\u2014 Harper and Griffin \u00a34 each\u2014 Shepherd \u00a33\u2014 Hallam for himself and his father, who was of little use, \u00a33 \u2014 Mrs. Heron \u00a35 \u2014 her salary had been raised from \u00a32 the preceding winter, yet she refused several parts and acted seldom \u2014 the Patentees were at the daily charge of more than \u00a349 each acting day. (Gent's Mag.) This statement must have been made with refer ence to the season 1732-1733 \u2014 Mrs. Cibber was at this time dead. But whatever was the case of the actors in general, the two Cibbers were certainly bound in conscience to support Highmore \u2014 Victor with honest indigna tion says, it appeared to him shocking that the son should immediately render void and worthless what his father had just received \u00a33150 for, as a valuable concern : and adds that he had frequent disputes with the father and son whenever they met. Davies tells us, that the elder Cibber applied to the Duke of Grafton, (probably) then Lord Chamberlain, for his interest to procure a Patent in favour of his son, which the Duke, seeing the injustice of the re quest, peremptorily refused. Highmore, thus distressed and deserted, collected what performers he could from the country theatres but none were of any promise, except Macklin. In this maimed condition the business of course went lamely on ; for a very middling company of players could be expected to bring but thin audiences, especially while party prevailed, and the same plays DD 2"], [414, "404 d. l. 1733-1734. were acted much better at the Hay.\u2014 in consequence of this, there was a balance every Saturday morning against the Manager of 50 or 60 Pounds ; and his pride, as well as his honour, was too much con cerned not to induce him to make up the deficiency every week with the greatest exactness : this defi ciency, which lasted from 20 to 30 weeks, amounted to a considerable sum. ( Victor.) On Oct. 30th the following letter was sent to Mr. John Mills and the other persons acting at the Hay. \u2014 but lately belonging to D. L. and C. G.\u2014 the letter was signed by Mary Wilks \u2014 John Highmore \u2014 John Ellys \u2014 and John Rich \" We have been daily in \" hopes, that before this, the mediation of friends \" would have put an end to the differences that have \" for some time been between us : and tho' we are \" well advised of the unlawfulness as well as unrea \" sonableness of your acting, yet we are extremely \" unwilling to take such methods as the law pre \" scribes, without first assuring you, that if you think \" fit to return to your respective companies, we shall \" be ready on our parts to do whatever can be thought \" reasonable for us : but if you still persevere in your \" separation, which is greatly prejudicial to us, we \" shall be necessitated (tho' contrary to our inclina \" tions) to proceed in such a manner as the law di \" rects, for supporting the royal patents under which \" we act : we are in hopes of an amicable answer \" from you, directed to the theatre in D. L.\" None of the persons directed to being there, it was left at Mr. Mills' house, and in about two hours after return'd unopcn'd ; and a new direction was immediately put on it, address'd to Mr. Theophilus Cibber : to which he the same day returned the sol-"], [415, "d.l. 1733-1734. 405 lowing lines \u2014 \" I have received a letter from you, \" which speaks of several persons and different com \" panies ; but as no particular names are mention'd, \" and the letter is directed to me alone, I can only \" answer for myself \u2014 I am well advis'd, that what I \" am about is legal, and I know 'tis reasonable ; and \" therefore I do not think of changing my present \" condition for servitude.\" (From Newspaper.) Highmore, thus deserted by his actors, first endea voured to prevail on the Lord Chamberlain to interfere in his behalf, but failing in this, he was persuaded to put the Vagrant Act in execution against the Seceders \u2014 accordingly Harper was taken up and committed to Bridewell Nov. 12 1733 \u2014 \u25a0 Davies tells us that Harper was fixed on, on account of his natural timidity, and the London Magazine says that previously to this, the Patentees of D. L. and C. G. being resolved to try whether they had an exclusive right to the acting of plays, for that pur pose summoned the Revels' company and the com pany of G. F. before a bench of Justices Nov. 5 ; the case was argued by Counsel on both sides, but the Justices, not being satisfied as to the formality of the summons, dismissed the players for that time. Nov. 20th Harper's case came on before the chief Justice of the King's Bench : many eminent lawyers were heard on both sides : in Harper's favour it was said, that tho' he was a player yet he did not wander about from place to place like a Vagabond, nor was there any appearance of his being chargeable to any parish ; for that he was not only a freeholder in Surry, but a housekeeper in Westminster ; and far ther that he was an honest man, paid his debts, did"], [416, "406 d. l. 1733-1734. no man any injury, and was well esteemed by many gentlemen of good condition against Harper it was alleged, that he came under the Act of the 12th of Queen Anne, and that he did wander from place to place, for that he had formerly acted at D. L. and likewise at Bartholemew and Southwark Fairs\u2014 the result was, that Harper was discharged upon his recognizance (Lond. Mag.) \u2014 and left Westminster Hall amidst the acclamations of several hundred persons who crowded it on the occasion. (Kirkman.) In the course of the season another enterprising- Gentleman appeared, Charles Fleetwood, Esq., who (as Victor says) purchased the whole Patent for very little more than poor Highmore gave for half of it \u2014 but Victor is not correct \u2014 Fleetwood probably pur chased the shares of Highmore and Mrs. Wilks, but Giffard beyond a doubt retained his portion of the Patent in 1735 \u2014 (see Hay. Aug. 1 1735) \u2014 and per haps for some years after. Fleetwood was a man of great fortune and fashion ; his friendship and connections with many persons of quality gave him the promise of a power that must carry all before it \u2014 and so it did \u2014 his first object was the bringing back of the Seceders, in which he had little difficulty ; the most grave and sensible part of them were already sick of their enterprize, and ashamed of being made the dupes of so young and wild a leader as Theo. Cibber they therefore readily closed with the overtures that were made them to return to D. L., thus peace was restored to the entire satisfaction of both parties ; but the attorney was now thought necessary, and articles of agreement were mutually signed between"], [417, "d. l. 1733-1734. 407 the manager and the actors, when not only the salary, but other particulars, as parts and privileges, were ascertained.

Provoked Husband and Festival. Dennis being much distressed very near the close of his life, it was proposed to act a play for his benefit; and Thomson, Mallet, Benjamin Martin and Pope took the lead upon the occasion, the play, which was the Provoked Husband, was represented at the Hay. Dec. 18 1733, and Pope, condescended so far to lay aside his resentment against his former antag onist as to write a Prologue which was spoken by Theo. Cibber \u2014 Dennis had at this time become blind \u2014 Pope's benevolence was not so pure as could be wished, for his Prologue was throughout a sneer upon the poor old critic, who happily, either from vanity, or the decay of his intellects, did not perceive its ten dency \u2014 Dennis survived this assistance only 20 days, dying on the 6th of Jan. 1733-4 in the 77th year of his age. (Biographia Britannica.) Pope's Prologue is not to be found in Warburton's edition of his works ; he was perhaps conscious that the printing of it would do him no credit. Dennis wrote or altered 9 dramatic pieces \u2014 2 of them are only bad alterations of Shakspeare's plays \u2014 his 4 Tragedies are indifferent \u2014 his 2 Comedies have considerable merit \u2014 some of his critical remarks are very good.

They state that if the bill now depending in Par liament for restraining the number of Playhouses, and for preventing any person from acting, except under the three Patents should pass into a law, it would subject them to the arbitrary will of any per sons, who might buy the Patents, for no doubt there may be soon (as has heretofore been practiced) Car tels, as they call them, established between the Patentees, that one house should never receive an actor, who had left the other, let the motive be ever so just\u2014 the Patentees may thus oblige the present actors to submit to the hardest terms, or reduce them to beggary by taking from them the exercise of their profession. They add that John Mills, Johnson, Miller, Theo. Cibber, Harper, Griffin, W. Mills, Milward, Mrs. Heron and Mrs. Butler had taken a lease of D.

Feb. 15 1745\u2014 so much had been said by the critics, who wrote against Cibber, in commendation of the original play, that Rich wisely determined to take the hint and revive it. This play was acted with applause, but King John did not suit Delane\u2014 Walker was excellent in Faul conbridge \u2014 tho' Garrick, Sheridan, Delane, and Barry, all of them afterwards acted this part, yet they all fell short of Walker \u2014 in him alone were found the several requisites for the character \u2014 a strong and muscular person, a bold and intrepid look, manly deportment, vigorous action, and a hu mour which descended with an easy familiarity in conveying a jest or sarcasm with uncommon poig nancy. Mrs. Hallam in Constance was natural and im passioned. (Davies) There is an old play on the story of King John in two parts, from which Shakspeare has borrowed the conduct of his piece, as well as some of the lines \u2014 the 1st part ends with Hubert's telling the King that he had saved Arthur ; that is with the 2d scene of Shakspeare's 4th act \u2014 the incidents are pretty much"], [515, "c. g. 1736-1737. 505 the same, except that Shakspeare has omitted the scene in which the Bastard threatens to hang a Friar, unless he will tell him where the Abbot keeps his gold; the Friar points to a chest, from which when it is opened, out comes a Nun ; the Bastard is going to hang Friar Antony, she promises to show him a press belonging to an old Nun with plate and money to the amount of 1000 marks\u2014 the press is opened and out comes Friar Lawrence \u2014 these must have been famous Clap-traps \u2014 the 2d part begins with Arthur throwing himself down from the prison walls \u2014 the conduct of this part does not differ ma terially from Shakspeare, except that the King is poisoned on the stage by a Monk \u2014 a circumstance in all probability not true, as it is not mentioned by the contemporary historians \u2014 the old play, as well as Shakspeare, represents King John as dying at Swin stead Abbey \u2014 he crossed from Lynn in Norfolk to Lincolnshire, a road which can only be travelled when the tide is out, and which is still always dan gerous in case of any delay \u2014 there he lost all his baggage, but got safe himself to Sivineshead Abbey in the Fens of Lincolnshire ; he was carried in a litter the next day to Sleaford, and the day after to Newark where he died \u2014 see Rapin \u2014 Swinstead is situated in that part of Lincolnshire which borders on the Counties of Rutland and Leicester, at a dis tance of at least 20 miles from those \" Lincoln Washes\" mentioned by Shakspeare \u2014 and at Swin stead there never was an Abbey.

Victor in a letter to Theophilus Cibber in 1751 says \u2014 \" when Mrs. Cibber was cast for Polly, she \" was very young, handsome, and an approved good \" singer ; she had every requisite to make the best \" Polly that had ever appeared \u2014 and so had Mrs. \" Clive for Lucy ; it would undoubtedly have been \" a fine entertainment so performed \u2014 but Clive was \" then in possession of the public voice \u2014 she was \" disgusted at the thoughts of losing Polly, and \" lodged her complaint \u2014 what a storm was raised ! \" but their favourite, right or wrong, was to be sup \" ported, tho' against judgment and common sense \" \u2014 I remember I was one of your friends that \" advised you to give it up \u2014 your wife was then new \" to the stage, and the match, as to popularity, was \" unequal ; and so the only opportunity of seeing \" the Beggar's Opera in perfection was lost.\" Fielding, in his Historical Register for 1736, makes Pistol (Theophilus Cibber) address the Mob thus \u2014 \" Say then, oh Town, is it your Royal Will, \" That my great Consort represent the part \" Of Polly Peachum in the Beggar's Opera?\" (See Hay. 1737 for the conclusion of Pistol's speech.)"], [521, "L.

Damn'd, Sir, damn'd ; \" they were damn'd at my first rehearsal, for which \" reason I have cut them out ; and to tell you the \" truth, I think the Town has honoured 'em enough \" with talking of them for a whole month ; tho', \" faith, I believe, it was owing to their having nothing \" else to talk of.\" In Dec. 1747 Mrs. Cibber acted Polly, and Mrs. Clive, Lucy at D. L. \u2014 nothing probably would have induced Mrs. Clive to have resigned Polly to Mrs. Cibber ; but as she had previously and of her own accord resigned the part to Miss Edwards, and played Lucy ; she could not well object to play Lucy to Mrs. Cibber's Polly.

April 10 1736) \u2014 \" I own it was a sensible pleasure to me to observe \" the Town, which had been so favourable to Pasquin \" at his own house, confirming that applause, by \" thoroughly condemning the Satire on him at yours L L 2"], [526, "516 HAY. 1737. \" \u2014 whether this was written by your command, or \" your assistance, or only acted by your permission, \" I will not venture to decide : indeed I am inclined \" to believe the latter ; for I fancy you have too strong \" a head ever to meddle with Common Sense, espe \" cially since you have found the way so well to \" succeed without her ; and you are too great and \" good a Manager, to keep a needless Supernumerary \" in your house.\" Fielding, in Tom Jones, calls Rich the inventor of that most exquisite entertainment called the English Pantomime\u2014 a great Genius \u2014 not a common Artist, but one of those \" inventas qui vitam excoluere per artes.\" He adds \" this Entertainment consisted of two parts, \" the Serious and the Comic\u2014 the Serious exhibited \" a certain number of Heathen Gods and Heroes, \" who were certainly the worst and dullest company \" into which an audience was ever introduced ; and \" (which was a secret known to few) were actually \" intended to be so, in order to contrast the Comic \" part and display the tricks of Harlequin to better \" advantage \u2014 the contrivance was ingenious and had \" its effect ; and this will plainly appear, if instead \" of Serious and Comic we substitute duller and \" dullest ; for the Comic was certainly duller than \" any thing before shown on the stage, and could \" only be set off by that superlative dullness which \" composed the Serious ; so intolerably serious were \" these Gods and Heroes, that Harlequin was always \" welcome on the stage, as he relieved the audience \" from worse company.\" (Fielding.)"], [527, "HAY. 1737. 517 In the Entertainments the serious and comic scenes succeeded each other alternately \u2014 see Orpheus and Eurydice C.

LICENSING ACT. An Act of Parliament was passed for limiting the number of Theatres, and for enacting that no Play, or even Prologue and Epilogue should be exhibited without the approbation of a Licenser. It has been said that this Act was occasioned by the political strokes in Pasquin and other plays ; but such an act had been in the contemplation of Parlia ment before Pasquin was written \u2014 on the 5th of"], [531, "521 LICENSING ACT. March 1734-5 Sir John Bernard moved the House of Commons for leave to introduce a bill, for re straining the number of playhouses, and for regulat ing common players ; his motion passed unanimously, but the bill was no sooner introduced, than it was relinquished. (Chalmers.) The Minister was no doubt galled by the political strokes, which Fielding had, with some wit, and greater impropriety, introduced on the stage ; but the immediate cause of the Licensing Act seems to have been the Golden Rump, a piece offered to Giffard the Manager, and by him carried to the Minister ; the Golden Rump was so scurrilous (see B. D.) that it afforded the Minister a plausible pretence for effect ing what he wished \u2014 and a gagging bill for the stage was passed June 21 1737- Lord Chesterfield, infinitely to his credit, opposed this bill, in a celebrated speech \u2014 he plainly and dis tinctly foretold that the power about to be given to the Licenser would in all probability be abused \u2014 and indeed this was no more than what any person of common sense and without prejudice, would natur ally foresee. If the power of the Licenser had been laid under proper regulations, all would have been right ; but such is the bias of human nature, that it very rarely happens that Arbitrary Power is not abused \u2014 which seems a plain and sufficient reason for not lodging it in any person's hands, without the utmost necessity. At present there is a strong argument against the Licensing Act ; namely that the power granted by it has been scandalously abused \u2014 if the Licenser has of late years acted in a somewhat less arbitrary man-"], [532, "522 d.l. 1737-1738. ner than his Predecessors, this is owing rather to the spirit of the times, than to any other circum stance. It should be observed that this act of Parliament, though it gave a legal sanction to the power of the Lord Chamberlain, yet it certainly did not give him any more power than he had often exercised \u2014 it was only about 8 years before, that Polly had been pro hibited from being acted. It was said in the House of Commons that there were no fewer than six playhouses \" the Opera \" house, the French playhouse in the Hay. and the \"Theatres in C. G., D. L., L.I.F., and G. F.\"\u2014 (Chalmers) \u2014 but the Opera-house was not a play house, and of the other five, only four were open at the same time. In Feb. 1738 according to the Manuscript in B.

In the Agamemnon of \u00c6schylus the taking of Troy is announced at Argos by the means of fire beacons \u2014 Agamemnon returns and brings Cassandra \u2022with him \u2014 Clytemnestra meets him in a friendly manner \u2014 after they have made their exit, Cassan dra prophesies the death of Agamemnon and herself the cries of Agamemnon, who is mortally wounded, are heard from behind the scenes \u2014 Clytemnestra enters she boasts that she had killed her husband with her own hand\u2014 she pretends to justify herself,"], [546, "536 d. l. 1737-1738. by alleging that Agamemnon had sacrificed Iphigenia \u2014 she slightly mentions his intimacy with Cassandra \u2014 \u00c6gysthus, the paramour of Clytemnestra, exults over the fate of Agamemnon. Seneca treats the story in a manner somewhat different \u2014 Cassandra foretells Agamemnon's death to himself, but with some obscurity \u2014 he does not believe her \u2014 - \u00c6gysthus and Clytemnestra in con junction kill Agamemnon \u2014 Electra consigns Orestes to the care of Strophius, who carries him off in safety \u2014 Clytemnestra orders Electra to be imprisoned, and Cassandra to be killed \u2014 the Agamemnon of \u00c6s chylus is a fine play ; that of Seneca is very inferiour \u2014 it consists of 1012 lines, of which about 160 are taken up with the tumid description of a tempest. In the 3d act of Thomson's play, Melisander tells Areas that he was left on a desart island by the command of Egisthus \u2014 that he continued there 7 years \u2014 that Agamemnon, on his return from Troy, touched at the island, and brought him home \u2014 in the additions which Thomson has here made to Homer's story, he has not exceeded a fair poetical license \u2014 in the 5th act, Clytemnestra endeavours to dissuade Egysthus from his intention of murdering Agamem non \u2014 Cassandra prophesies the death of Agamemnon \u2014 he is killed behind the scenes \u2014 Electra consigns Orestes to the care of Melisander \u2014 the back scene opens, and discovers the dead body of Agamemnon \u2014 Clytemnestra faints, and is carried off by her attend ants \u2014 a messenger tells Egisthus that Melisander had presented Orestes to the Senate, and roused them to revenge \u2014 Egisthus orders his friends to be assembled, and Cassandra to be put to death \u2014 Cas-"], [547, "D. l. 1737-1738. 537 sandra speaks 4 or 5 lines, and the play concludes \u2014 Some parts of this T. are very well written, but on the whole it is only a moderate play \u2014 Thomson has taken unwarrantable liberties with the story \u2014 he has softened the character of Clytemnestra to so great a degree, that she is no longer the Clytemnestra of the Greek poets \u2014 the presentation of Orestes to the Senate is an abominable perversion of the real fact \u2014 Thomson is the more inexcusable, as after all he has not brought the story of Egisthus to any absolute conclusion \u2014 each of the three Greek Tragedians has a play on the return of Orestes to Argos, and the subsequent death of Clytemnestra and \u00c6gysthus \u2014 but these events took place several years after the murder of Agamemnon\u2014 Ore stts was sent away as a boy \u2014 he returned as a man \u2014 Thomson has been so absurd as to introduce the word Madam about 30 times \u2014 Victor in one of his letters (p. 10) gives an account of the alterations made in Agamemnon after the 1st night \u2014 Davies says that Mrs. Porter in Clytemnestra showed herself to be a consummate actress. Thomson, in reading his play to the actors in the Green room, pronounced every line with such a broad Scotch accent, that they could not restrain themselves from a loud laugh : upon this, the author good-naturedly said to the Manager, \" do you Sir \" take my play and go on with it ; for tho' I can write \" a Tragedy, I find I cannot read one\" \u2014 (Davies) Dryden read Poetry with a very bad grace \u2014 Rowe was so excellent a reciter of his own composi tions, that Mrs. Oldfield used to say she had no occa sion for any other study, than that of hearing him"], [548, "538 d. l. 1737-1738. read her part in any of his plays \u2014 (Malone) \u2014 Lee, tho' he did not succeed on the stage, was so pathetic a reader of his own scenes, that Mohun one day at Rehearsal, in the warmth of admirations threw down his part, and said, \" unless I were able to play \" it as well as you read it, to what purpose should I \" undertake it?\" (Cibber.)

The Collection in the British Museum for this season has not one printed bill, and the Manuscript contains little information beyond the title of the plays. The Compiler of the Manuscript bills has one great fault ; he sometimes puts the name of a performer to the part he usually played, without having any sufficient authority for concluding that he played the part on that particular evening\u2014accord ing to his Manuscript Mrs. Porter acted Belvidera"], [552, "542 d. l. 1737-1738. on Feb. 3 1738, and Zara on Feb. 10, but it is certain from Mr. Field's bills that she did not play either of the parts. Mr. Field's bills were purchased at Isaac Reed's sale\u2014 Mr. Reed had dated the bills of 1738 as the bills of 1737 \u2014 the Queen's death puts it past a doubt that Mr. Reed had dated his bills wrong, as according to his computation the theatres were not shut in Nov. for the Queen's death. The bills in the British Museum and those in the collection of Mr. Field at this period of the stage are cut out of the newspapers \u2014 not the bills regularly printed for the theatres \u2014 these bills when taken from the papers in which the Managers advertised the plays, are generally correct ; when they are taken from the other papers, they are not to be depen ded on. Mr. Field's bills for 1738, 1739, 1740 and 1742, came into my possession in 1827. Theophilus Cibber and his wife did not act in the last part of this season \u2014 the account which Victor gives of them is to this effect \u2014 \" The particular cir \" cumstances attending their marriage were much \" talked of \u2014 he soon left her to deplore his absence \u00ab \u2014 in their first country retirement, Mr. Sloper \" was a constant visitor, as a friend to the husband, \" and was requested by him, to teach his wife the \" game of back-gammon, while he pursued his fa \" vourite diversion of hunting in the purlieus of Co \" vent Garden \u2014 the Gentleman's passion for Mrs. \" Cibber was not long a secret, and his purse was \" soon at the command of the husband ; who, it \" seems, had borrowed to the amount of \u00a3400 ; and"], [553, "d.l. 1737-1738. 543 \" under these weighty obligations T. Cibber would \" have put his horns in his pocket, if his wife would \" have continued with him for the use of both parties \" \u2014 but she having too much nicety, as well as ho \" nour, her resentment soon fired her with resolution \" enough to despise her husband, and publicly avow \" her passion for Mr. S., by leaving the stage, and \" retiring with him to a house he had taken for that \" purpose, near Windsor. \" This loss of his wife, or rather of her salary, T. \" Cibber could not bear \u2014 having procured sufficient \" assistance he brought her back by force, and con \" fined her in his house \u2014 from whence she was res \" cued by the same means, while her husband was \" acting Scrub\" \u2014 see D. L. Sep. 28 1738. A Pamphlet called \u2014 \" The Tryal of a cause for \" criminal conversation, between Theophilus Cibber \" Gent. Plaintiff, and William Sloper Esqre. Defen \" dant\" \u2014 was published in 1739 \u2014 the cause was heard on the 5th of December 1738 \u2014 the intimacy between Mr. Sloper and Mrs. Cibber was proved in the clearest manner \u2014 it was equally clear that T. Cibber had connived at it \u2014 the Jury gave a verdict for the Plaintiff \u2014 and \u00a310 for damages \u2014 Colley Cib ber and Fleetwood were examined, but their evidence was of no importance Victor's account is not correct \u2014 it appears that Mr. Sloper and Mrs. Cibber had private meetings in Dec. 1737 \u2014 in the summer of 1738 T. Cibber and his wife lived together in the same house, with Mr. Sloper, at Burnham in Buck inghamshire \u2014 a door opened between the bedcham bers of T. Cibber and Mr. Sloper \u2014 Mrs. Cibber used to go into Mr. Sloper's room, and T. Cibber used to"], [554, "d. l. 1737-1738. 544 wish her good night \u2014 in Sep. T. Cibber took his wife from Burnham \u2014 he committed her to the care of a man who was faithful to his trust, but her bro ther rescued her by force, and carried her to her mother's \u2014 Mr. Sloper was there \u2014 she went with him to Reading, where she continued till about 5 weeks before the trial. In 1751 T. Cibber had thoughts of attempting to prevent his wife from acting in London \u2014 Victor wrote him a letter to dissuade him from this, as the Public, on whom he was himself dependent for a livelihood, would probably resent their being de prived of such an actress \u2014 Victor's advice was good \u2014 the public indignation would naturally be excited against a man, who, having been himself notoriously guilty of conjugal infidelity, should attempt to punish his wife for the same. Miller's name does not appear after this time, he seems to have been dead or too ill to act at the open ing of the theatre in Sep. \u2014 he was a natural spirited Comedian; he was famous for Teague in the Com mittee and other similar parts \u2014 and tho' the Gentle men of Ireland would never admit that he had the true Brogue, yet he substituted something in the room of it, that made his Teague very diverting to an English audience ; and perhaps more so than if played by an Irishman ; for Victor had often seen that character so extremely well acted in Dublin that he did not understand one word of what the actor said.* * Morris, celebrated for the Brave Irishman in Sheridan's Farce."], [555, "d. l. 1737-1738. 545 Miller was excellent in Sir Joseph Wittol, Tall boy, Kastril, Ben, &c. \u2014 and as a full proof of the force of his abilities, he died in the receipt of a good salary, which he had long enjoyed, without being able to read \u2014 it was said that his principal object in mar rying was to have a wife, who was able to read his parts to him.

Dion. Be one of those that think The pretty wrens of Tharsus will fly hence, And open this to Pericles. I do shame To think of what a noble strain you are, And of how coward a spirit. Cleon. To such proceeding Who ever but his approbation added, Though not his pre-consent, he did not flow From honourable courses. Dion. Be it so then : Yet none doth know, but you, how she came dead, Nor none can know, Leonine being gone. She did disdain my child, and stood between Her and her fortunes : none would look on her But cast their gazes on Marina's face ; Whilst ours was blurted at, and held a malkin Not worth the time of day. It pierc'd me thorough ; And though you call my course unnatural, You not your child well loving, yet I find, It greets me, as an enterprize of kindness, Perform'd to your sole daughter. Cleon.

Pericles was originally very successful \u2014 the Pro logue to the Hog hath lost his pearl concludes thus \u2014 \" And, if it prove so happy as to please, \" We'll say 'tis fortunate, like Pericles.\" Pericles wasprobably successful, when revived by Rhodes' company about the time of the Restoration \u2014 Downes mentions Pericles as one of Betterton's best parts.

Lillo begins with Shakspeare's 4th act \u2014 he changes Dionyza to her daughter Philoten \u2014 and represents Leonine as a young lord, instead of a servant \u2014 Marina is judiciously brought by the Pirates to Ephesus instead of Mitylene \u2014 some other alterations, and some additions are made \u2014 but this act does not differ materially from Shakspeare.

Act 3 begins with a good comic scene, and a dull serious one, both by Lillo \u2014 as the last act of the original play must have been very awkward in repre sentation, Lillo very properly concludes his play in the Temple of Diana at Ephesus \u2014 Pericles enters \u2014 Thaisa is present, when he discovers Marina to be his daughter \u2014 Diana is of course left out.

P. seems to have used no more than a fair poeti cal license \u2014 as Vertot mentions Arvida (Arwide) as the friend of Gustavus, but relates few particulars about him, it is probable that Brooke borrowed the thought of enlarging his character from Mrs. Trotter's play \u2014 (see Revolution of Sweden Hay.

Orpheus and Eurydice (seemingly) 1st time \u2014 this Entertainment was very successful \u2014 the descrip tion of it occupied the bills for a considerable time, and the Plays were advertised without the characters. The principal performer wanted on this occasion was a serpent to kill Eurydice \u2014 Rich was justly anxious about a point of so much consequence, and"], [629, "c. g. 1739-1740. 619 an ingenious artist answered his most ardent hopes \u2014the artist was intoxicated with his success ; and turned his hands and head to nothing else but ser pents \u2014 the public curiosity was satisfied with one serpent, and he had nests of them yet unsold ; his stock lay dead upon his hands, his trade was lost and the man was ruined, bankrupt and undone. ( Cum berland.) Orpheus and Eurydice, as acted at C. G., was pub lished in 1739. Persons in the Opera. Orpheus zz Salway: Pluto zz Le veri dge : Ascalax (his attendant) zz Laguerre : Eurydice (wife to Orpheus) zz Miss Young : Rhodope (Queen of Thrace, practising art magick) zz Mrs. Lampe : \u2014 Comic characters \u2014 Harle quin zz Lun : Pantaloon zz Grimaldi : Squire Gaw key zz Bencraft : Drudge (servant to Pantaloon) zz Hippisley: Columbine zz Mrs. Kilby : Mrs. Manner ly (mother to Gawkey) zz Mrs. Martin : \u2014 this piece is attributed to Theobald \u2014 it deserves some notice, as it shows us the nature of Rich's Entertainments. Interlude 1st. Rhodope makes love to Orpheus \u2014 he rejects her love \u2014 she is enraged \u2014 \" A Serpent \" appears, who receives Rhodope's commands, and, \" those ended, glides off the stage\" \u2014 Here the comic part begins \u2014 when the Opera is resumed, a scene takes place between Orpheus and Eurydice \u2014 Eury dice's heel is pierced by the serpent, behind the scenes \u2014 she dies on the stage\u2014 after which the comic part is continued. Interlude 2d. Scene Hell \u2014 Pluto, &c. enter \u2014 Orpheus prevails on Pluto to restore Eurydice to him \u2014Ascalax tells Orpheus that Eurydice shall follow him, but that if he should look back at her, before"], [630, "620 c. g. 1739-1740. they shall have passed the bounds of Hell, she will die again \u2014 Orpheus turns back to look for Eurydice \u2014 Fiends carry her away \u2014 after this, the comic part is resumed. Interlude 3d. Orpheus again rejects Rhodope's so licitations \u2014 he makes his exit \u2014 the scene draws and discovers Orpheus slain \u2014 several Baccants enter in a triumphant manner \u2014 they bring in the lyre and chap let of Orpheus \u2014 Rhodope stabs herself \u2014 the piece concludes with the remainder of the comic part. There is a celebrated Song on the story of Or pheus and Eurydice. 1st. When Orpheus went down to the regions below Which men are forbidden to see, He tuned up his lyre as old histories shew To set his Eurydice free ; All Hell was astonished a person so wise Should rashly endanger his life, And venture so far, but how vast their surprise, When they heard that he came for his wife. 2d. To find out a punishment due to the fault Old Pluto long puzzled his brain ; But Hell had not torments sufficient he thought So he gave him his wife back again. But pity succeeding soon vanquished his heart, And pleased with his playing so well He took her again in reward of his art ; Such power has Music in Hell."], [631, "621 c. g. 1739-1740. March 1.

William Milward at the time of his death was under 40, and was making daily improvement in his profession ; his person had the advantage of proper height, nor was he ungraceful in his deportment, his countenance was pleasing and expressive, his voice strong and harmonious, but he was apt to indulge himself in such an extension of it, as approached to vociferation \u2014 he was celebrated for Castalio, Jaffier and Oronooko, but he excelled most in characters where distress is dignified by superiority of rank, or rendered venerable by age or paternal affection \u2014 his Lusignan was not much inferior to Garrick's \u2014 on Mills' death he succeeded to Hamlet ; in his first in terview with the Ghost and in the closet scene, he was not only an agreeable, but a skilful actor \u2014 in this character he seemed to forget his love of ranting, which was his principal fault.
