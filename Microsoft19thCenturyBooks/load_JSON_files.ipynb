       "'LONDON AND ITS ENVIRONS. 18 III. THE ANCIENT CITY. REMAINS OF ROMAN LONDON. THE LONDON STONE. THE TOWER. — QUEEN VICTORIA\\'S KEYS. — ST. JOHN\\'S GATE. SHAKESPEARE\\'S HOUSE. The almost entire absence of ancient monuments in a city, the origin of wliich is so antiquated, is not one of the least surprises which London presents to the stranger. One fancies usually that the old \"City\" encloses a number of old (secular) edifices; that in those dark streets and obscure passages called \"lanes,\" new buildings would be the exception, not the rule. But this is an error. The dark houses which border the City ways are relatively modern, for, notwithstanding the respect whicli the English profess for all that savours of antiquity ; notwithstanding their love for old customs and ancient traditions (the word \"old\" is in English a term of affection), they know how to make allowance for increasing necessities and new wants, and sacrifice — not without hesitation, it is true, but nevertheless with determination — -all the ancient monuments which, useless or in the way, impede the development of their metropolis. It is for this reason tbat the picturesque houses, which formerly were visible in the City, have almost entirely disappeared, and are now replaced by massive edifices, in which iron, stone, and marble, are used profusely ; and while thus beautifying the City, the aspect of which is changing day by day, the Londoners are protecting it against destruction by fire, of which the risks in London are so great. As a matter of fact, at all times the City has had to contend against this formidable foe. Seven times before the terrible catastrophe of 1666, whicli destroyed 13,000 houses and 87 churches, the City has been the prey of the flames. One would have fancied that after such severe lessons, the civic authorities, rendered wiser by experience, would have taken measures to prevent the recurrence of similar calamities. But nothing came of it, and it is only within the last few years that the corporation has taken energetic measures, and given the impulse thanks to which the City is losing its picturesqueness, but is gaining in salubrity — and, let us confess it, in beauty. At the present time, when the pickaxe of the bouse demolisher is finishing the work begun by fire, there remain but a few scarce vestiges of ancient London, known ouly to archæologists and antiquaries, who deplore the approaching disappearance of oven these remains. Let us pass them quickly in review, and salute in these old ruins a past time of blood and barbarism, but a period not without glory and grandeur as well. Of the Roman enceinte, built in the year 306, there remain but a few fragments in the street called London Wall, near St. Alphage\\'s Church, in Bloomfield Street, Finsbury, and in St. Martin\\'s Court, on the South side of Ludgate Hill. Another very interesting relic, also dating from the Roman period, is the London Stone encased in the wall of St. Swithin\\'s Church, opposite Cannon Street Railway Station. All opinions agree in recognizing this block of granite as a \" mile-stone,\" placed by the Romans in the centre of the town, like that in the Forum at Rome, from which all distances were'"
